[19]Q Okay. Doctor, can you -- obviously you are a
[20]medical doctor, correct?
[21]A Correct.
[22]Q For the purpose of the jury can you give us a
[23]brief run down of your education?
[24]A Yes. I received my medical training at
[25]University of Miami, my MD degree. That was received in
[6]
[1]May of 1991. Underwent family practice residency
[2]program, Halifax Medical Center, Daytona Beach, Florida,
[3]'91 to '94, and have been practicing in this area since
[4]that time.
[5]Q Are you board certified?
[6]A Yes, I am.
[7]Q And that would be in family medicine?
[8]A Correct.
[9]Q And when were you first board certified?
[10]A First board certified, that would have been in
[11]1992.
[12]Q Okay. And for the purpose of the jury can you
[13]explain what board certification means?
[14]A It means undergoing the proper education and
[15]practicing the -- practicing medicine according to its
[16]standards, passing the appropriate board examinations,
[17]and showing qualifications to practice medicine
[18]adequately.
[19]Q Okay. And how many times have you been
[20]recertified?
[21]A That has been twice.
[22]Q Okay. And we're currently at your practice
[23]today?
[24]A Correct.
[25]Q Okay. And during the course of your practice
[7]
[1]did you have the opportunity to treat a patient by the
[2]name of Tracy Hines?
[3]A Yes, I have.
[4]Q Okay. And do you have your file regarding
[5]Ms. Hines with you today?
[6]A Yes, I do.
[7]Q Okay. And for the purpose of the jury can you
[8]tell us -- well, first and foremost, I kind of skipped
[9]ahead. What is the name of your practice?
[10]A Coastal Family Practice.
[11]Q Okay. And how long has Ms. Hines been a
[12]patient of Coastal Family Practice?
[13]A She established herself as a patient here in
[14]1997.
[15]Q Okay. And just for the purpose of the record,
[16]were you treating her in 1997?
[17]A Yes, I was.
[18]Q Okay. So between 1997 to the present you have
[19]been Ms. Hines' primary care doctor?
[20]A Yes, that's correct.
[21]Q Okay. All right. And Ms. Hines, as any
[22]primary care doctor, she's seen you for headaches to
[23]sinus infections to any multiple reasons, correct?
[24]A Yes, that's correct.
[25]Q Okay. And I'm not going to ask you to go
[8]
[1]through 20 so years of treating her, but in review of
[2]your file, did you over the course between 1997 and the
[3]present date, how many times do you think you've seen
[4]Ms. Hines?
[5]A Twenty times or more.
[6]Q Okay. On some of the visits here at Coastal
[7]Family Practice, she would've also seen a physician's
[8]assistant?
[9]A Correct.
[10]Q Okay. Now, during her treatment here at
[11]Coastal Family Practice, do you ever remember an
[12]occasion where Ms. Hines complained of neck pain?
[13]A Not going by recollection, but my medical
[14]records, the first time she complained of neck pain was
[15]on 5/23/2008 when she was seen by the physician's
[16]assistant Shelly. She later complained of neck pain on
[17]5/23/2011 after a motor vehicle accident.
[18]Q Okay. All right. So if you don't mind we'll
[19]go to that 5/23/2008 complaint of neck pain.
[20]A Okay.
[21]Q For the purpose of the jury can you tell us --
[22]I understand you didn't see her, your physician's
[23]assistant Mr. Fradet, I believe, F-R-A-D-E-T --
[24]A Right.
[25]Q -- saw Ms. Hines.
[9]
[1]A Right.
[2]Q Can you tell me what brought her to you, or
[3]when you say you, I mean Coast Family Practice?
[4]A She -- her chief complaint was elbow pain and
[5]she presented noticing these symptoms after doing yoga
[6]After certain positions she had pain in her right elbow
[7]with certain movements and then she had pain also
[8]underneath her right scapula at that time.
[9]Q Okay. And for the purpose of the jury can
[10]you -- can you tell us or describe where the right
[11]scapula is?
[12]A That is -- the right scapula basically is here
[13]and underneath that area (indicating).
[14]Q Okay. The shoulder blade area?
[15]A Underneath the shoulder blade in --
[16]Q Okay.
[17]A -- layman's terms, yes.
[18]Q All right. And did she complain of any
[19]specific neck pain on that visit of 5/23/2008?
[20]A Again upon review of Shelly's record, she
[21]denied neck pain, but she diagnosed her as possibly a
[22]cervical strain in that situation.
[23]Q Now, on that 5/23/2008 visit, did it appear
[24]Ms. Fradet performed a physical examination of her
[25]cervical spine?
[10]
[1]A Yes, that's correct.
[2]Q And was there any positive findings as it
[3]relates to the cervical spine?
[4]A She mentioned that her neck was non tender.
[5]Q And what does that mean?
[6]A That means with palpation and adequate
[7]pressure she couldn't elicit any pain.
[8]Q Okay. Now, did it appear that she had any
[9]difficulty with what we would call range of motion?
[10]A She had full range of motion of her
[11]extremities.
[12]Q Okay. And specifically her neck?
[13]A Correct.
[14]Q Okay. All right. What type of treatment, if
[15]anything, did Ms. Fradet recommend for Ms. Hines on that
[16]5/23/2008 visit?
[17]A She advised anti-inflammatories including
[18]Motrin, compression banding, ice, rest and a muscle
[19]relaxer was prescribed, Flexeril.
[20]Q All right. And moving forward to the
[21]5/23/2011 visit, Doctor, on that occasion what would --
[22]what was Ms. Hines' complaints?
[23]A At the time she stated that she was involved
[24]in a motor vehicle accident on May 12, 2011. She was
[25]the restrained driver wearing a seat belt. She was rear
[11]
[1]ended. She reported that she -- the note says alleged,
[2]but lurched forward and back. At that time her hand was
[3]on her stick-shift. Her airbags did not deploy. She
[4]did experience immediate pain in her right neck and
[5]shoulder area. She refused transport to the emergency
[6]room at that time. She did attempt ibuprofen and
[7]massage, but was still symptomatic. She could not swim
[8]or ride her bicycle. Noticed some tingling, paresthesia
[9]in her right arm and then presented to our office.
[10]Q Okay. And on that 5/23/2011 visit, did you
[11]see her?
[12]A Yes, I did.
[13]Q Okay. Did you perform a physical examination?
[14]A Yes, I did.
[15]Q And what did the physical examination consist
[16]of?
[17]A At that time it was measuring her pain to
[18]palpation. Her neck was very tender to palpation and
[19]tight on the right paracervical area is more than the
[20]left side. She had decreased range of motion, but she
[21]did have full flexion. Right lateral abduction was to
[22]20 degrees. Left lateral abduction was full. Decreased
[23]rotation and also tenderness of her right shoulder. And
[24]she had limited mobility of her shoulder due to her
[25]pain.
[12]
[1]Q Okay. Now, for the purpose of the jury
[2]what -- regarding the range of motion, what is typically
[3]normal range of motion?
[4]A Range of motion, I have to look it up. I
[5]usually have to look it up. This was decreased.
[6]Forgive me, I have a cheat-sheet I use in the rooms.
[7]MS. LOPEZ: Take your time.
[8]THE WITNESS: Okay. Let me just grab my
[9]cheat-sheet, can we do that?
[10]MS. LOPEZ: Yeah. Can we go off.
[11]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. The time
[12]is 2:15.
[13](There was a brief pause in the record.)
[14]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record.
[15]The time is 2:17. On the record.
[16]THE WITNESS: And your question was in
[17]reference to the normal values for range of motion?
[18]MS. LOPEZ: Yes, ma'am.
[19]THE WITNESS: Cervical spine flexion 50
[20]degrees. Extension 60 degrees. Right lateral
[21]flexion of 45 degrees. Left lateral flexion 45
[22]degrees. Right rotation on 80 degrees. Left
[23]rotation 80 degrees.
[24]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[25]Q Okay. So just to go over the -- as far as
[13]
[1]abduction, she was only at 25 degrees which is obviously
[2]less than normal, correct?
[3]A Correct.
[4]Q And flexion again she was also 25 degrees,
[5]correct?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q Okay. So those are abnormal findings?
[8]A Correct.
[9]Q All right. Now, do you on that occasion of
[10]5/23/2011, she was complaining of tingling in her right
[11]arm?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q If you can, what does tingling in the right
[14]arm typically indicate?
[15]A It typically indicates impingement of the
[16]nerve, inflammation, some type of injury --
[17]Q Okay.
[18]A -- to the nerve route.
[19]Q And again, Doctor, I'm not going to ask you to
[20]go through each and every single note in the many years
[21]that you've treated Ms. Hines, but in review of your
[22]file regarding Ms. Hines, do you ever remember an
[23]occasion where she complained of any tingling in her
[24]right arm prior to May 23, 2011?
[25]A No, I do not. She had complained of some
[14]
[1]shoulder pain at different times, but not of tingling or
[2]paresthesia down her arm --
[3]Q Okay. Now, after that -- your physical
[4]examination, what was your diagnosis on May 23, 2011?
[5]A It was right neck and shoulder strain
[6]secondary to her motor vehicle accident.
[7]Q Did you recommend a course of treatment?
[8]A Yes, she was referred to the chiropractor.
[9]Q And I believe you also recommended her to have
[10]some X-rays?
[11]A She had had X-rays, I believe, prior.
[12]Q Oh, okay.
[13]A Let me review that. Her X-rays of the
[14]cervical spine showed spondylosis at that time.
[15]Q Okay. And so you referred her out for
[16]treatment to, I think it's Dr. Prakop?
[17]A That's correct.
[18]Q Okay. Now, did you continue to follow up with
[19]Ms. Hines regarding the injuries to her neck?
[20]A At her next visit she was seen again by
[21]Shelly, RPA, Ms. Fradet, and was evaluated on
[22]10/28/2011.
[23]Q Okay. And on that visit did she have any
[24]complaints of neck pain?
[25]A She did. The neck pain persisted.
[15]
[1]Q And what about radiculopathy traveling down
[2]her right upper extremity?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q Okay.
[5]A It did persist as well.
[6]Q Did you make any recommendations for treatment
[7]as her primary care doctor through Ms. Fradet?
[8]A Yes. Ms. Fradet recommended pain management.
[9]I also treated her with a Medrol dose pack, recommended
[10]muscle relaxants and advised that they could consider
[11]some other medication and possibly referral to a
[12]neurosurgeon.
[13]Q Okay. Now, during that -- in that interim
[14]between the May 23rd and the October 28, 2011, Ms. Hines
[15]had had an MRI, correct?
[16]A Correct.
[17]Q Okay. And that MRI was her cervical spine?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q Do you have the findings of that MRI?
[20]A Yes, this is dated 5/25/2000 -- I'm sorry,
[21]5/24/2011.
[22]Q So she had the MRI the next day following your
[23]visit?
[24]A Correct.
[25]Q Okay. And what were the results of the
[16]
[1]cervical MRI?
[2]A It was a loss of the cervical lordosis or the
[3]natural curvature of the spine. She had a small disc
[4]protrusion, or small disc protrusion of three discs and
[5]also a larger disc protrusion involving the C6 nerve
[6]route.
[7]Q Okay. Now, Doctor, are you familiar with
[8]dermatome patterns?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Okay. And if you don't mind, can you explain
[11]to the jury what dermatome patterns are?
[12]A The nerves basically come from the brain, they
[13]come down the spinal cord, they exit little openings in
[14]the spinal column and innervate and provide sensation
[15]and motor function for the different areas of the body.
[16]So the area that was affected mostly was C6, and that
[17]affects the shoulder, deltoid, bicep region down the
[18]arm.
[19]Q Okay. So once you saw the cervical MRI and
[20]you noted that there -- the C6 level on the cervical MRI
[21]was abnormal, were her pain complaints and her
[22]presentation consistent with the MRI findings?
[23]A Yes, they were.
[24]Q Okay. Now, just moving forward to the
[25]10/28/2011 visit. You said you recommended, obviously,
[17]
[1]some medication. You also recommended pain management,
[2]and I think you said possible to see a neurosurgeon; is
[3]that correct?
[4]A It was Ms. Fradet, our PA, but, yes, that
[5]was that was recommended.
[6]Q What would be the need for pain management?
[7]A The pain management could provide steroid
[8]injections at that level to provide relief and decrease
[9]the inflammation and possibly gain control.
[10]Q And what would be the need for Ms. Hines to
[11]see -- what was -- why was there a recommendation to a
[12]neurosurgeon?
[13]A I believe the comment was -- was to try pain
[14]management first. We always attempt that, do something
[15]less evasive. And if that was unsuccessful, then
[16]consider a neurosurgeon.
[17]Q Okay. At any point did you recommend
[18]Ms. Hines be seen by an actual pain management doctor?
[19]A Yes, referrals were made to pain management.
[20]Q Okay. Which doctors was she referred to see?
[21]A She was referred to Dr. Hague, Dr. Cummings.
[22]Q Okay.
[23]A And I believe she did see Dr. -- she saw
[24]Dr. Iranpur, but this is according to her insurance
[25]essentially. They dictated which physician she should
[18]
[1]see.
[2]Q Okay.
[3]THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry. What was the
[4]last doctor you mentioned?
[5]THE WITNESS: Oh, Iranpur. It's I-- and
[6]Hague is spelled H-A-Q-U-E. Iranpur is
[7]I-R-A-N-P-U-R.
[8]THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you.
[9]THE WITNESS: Sure.
[10]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[11]Q Okay. All right. When --
[12]MR. SIERRA: Excuse me. Let's just go off the
[13]record for a second.
[14]MS. LOPEZ: Sure.
[15]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. Time is
[16]2:24. Off the record.
[17](There was an off-the-record discussion.)
[18]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record.
[19]It's 2:25. On the record.
[20]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[21]Q All right, Doctor. I'm just -- I'm going to
[22]take a step back now for a couple visits. When
[23]reviewing Ms. Hines' medical records here at Coastal
[24]Family Practice, it appears that at least yearly
[25]Ms. Hines underwent what is called a Well Woman Exam.
[19]
[1]A That's correct.
[2]Q Okay. And it appears that she had one at
[3]least yearly or every other year?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q Okay. And please correct me if I'm wrong, the
[6]last one that I show prior to the date of this incident
[7]was September 10, 2010?
[8]A That's correct.
[9]Q Okay. And on that date it appears that
[10]regarding the neck exam it said normal, is that correct?
[11]A That's correct.
[12]Q Okay. Now, just briefly, Doctor, let's talk
[13]about the time frames when you mentioned earlier that
[14]she had some shoulder complaints, okay? And I show some
[15]throughout the years, you know, 2005, 2006. If you
[16]don't mind just quickly perusing those records to see if
[17]either a left or right shoulder complaint, if there was
[18]ever any indication that the neck pain -- that the
[19]shoulder pain she was experiencing was coming from her
[20]neck?
[21]A There's notation 2005 of right shoulder pain.
[22]There's no mention of neck pain at that time. There's
[23]another notation of shoulder pain in 2009, 4/29/2009,
[24]and no mention of neck pain at that time either.
[25]Q So the last time you show any complaint of any
[20]
[1]shoulder pain would have been in 2009?
[2]A Correct.
[3]Q Okay. Doctor, when's the last time you saw
[4]Ms. Hines?
[5]A I saw her -- let me pull up my electronic
[6]medical record. She was seen 11/25/2014.
[7]Q Okay. And how was she doing from her neck
[8]pain?
[9]A She was doing well. Doing well.
[10]Q All right. And regarding any opinions
[11]regarding the need for surgery to her neck, that she
[12]ultimately have pain management, you would defer to
[13]those medical practitioners, correct?
[14]A Correct.
[15]MS. LOPEZ: All right. Doctor, that's all the
[16]questions I have right now. Thank you for your
[17]time.
[18]MR. SIERRA: Let's just go briefly off the
[19]record.
[20]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record. The
[21]time is approximately 2:28. Off the record.
[22](There was an off-the-record discussion.)
[23]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record.
[24]The time is 2:30. On the record.
[25]CROSS-EXAMINATION
[21]
[1]BY MR. SIERRA:
[2]Q Hi, Doctor. My name is David Sierra. I
[3]represent the Defendant in this case. I just have a few
[4]questions for you.
[5]First of all, I was looking at your chart and
[6]there's some, on the right side of your chart before you
[7]get to your office visit notes, there's some handwritten
[8]notes, and who makes those notes?
[9]A They're made by my staff or myself. Anyone
[10]involved with the patient's care.
[11]Q Are they like phone messages or -- or is
[12]that -- that's not part of the office note itself
[13]though?
[14]A It could be any type of interaction or
[15]communication with the patient. So, yes, phone
[16]messages, other dialogue we had with them.
[17]Q Okay. So in -- in -- in February, I believe
[18]it was, of 2013 when there's an indication in there that
[19]she was running in a marathon that weekend, what -- what
[20]was she requesting of your office, can you tell from
[21]that note?
[22]A From the note it appears that she phoned and
[23]was requesting antibiotics.
[24]Q Okay. What did that have to do with the
[25]marathon, was that just --
[22]
[1]A I can't comment on that. I just know that she
[2]needed -- she was requesting antibiotics.
[3]Q Okay. Did she -- was that something that you
[4]wrote down or would that have been somebody in your
[5]staff?
[6]A No, my medical assistant.
[7]Q Okay. And just going back to the 2008 visit
[8]where there's the cervical strain diagnosis, the way the
[9]note is written, I realize you didn't write that note,
[10]this was your physician's assistant?
[11]A Correct.
[12]Q But when you look under the impression and
[13]plan, it appears that the Flexeril was prescribed
[14]specifically for the cervical strain at that time,
[15]correct?
[16]A Correct.
[17]Q What is Flexeril?
[18]A Flexeril is a muscle relaxant.
[19]Q Okay. Now, with regard to the accident
[20]that -- that this case is about, the one that occurred
[21]on May 12, 2011, you have no information regarding the
[22]severity of the impact, correct?
[23]A Correct.
[24]Q And you have never seen any property damage
[25]photos or anything of that nature?
[23]
[1]A Correct.
[2]Q All right. And the only thing that I think
[3]was noted in your records about what happened that date
[4]was that she declined medical treatment at the scene, is
[5]that correct?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q All right. And when you ordered the MRI of
[8]the cervical spine, and I realize that you're not a
[9]radiologist and you rely on the radiologist for the
[10]interpretation, correct?
[11]A Uh-huh.
[12]Q The -- at the C5-6 level there was a -- a bone
[13]spur identified at that level.
[14]A Okay.
[15]Q Is that correct?
[16]A Let me find the record here. Correct
[17]Q And it was on the right, correct?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q And a bone spur is -- what is a bone spur,
[20]Doctor?
[21]A A bone spur is a protrusion of the bone that
[22]typically occurs from inflammation or some type of
[23]injury.
[24]Q And these take -- these take time to develop,
[25]correct?
[24]
[1]A That's correct.
[2]Q All right. So if this accident occurred on
[3]May 12, 2011 and this MRI was taken on May 24, 2011,
[4]certainly you would agree that that bone spur preexisted
[5]the accident?
[6]A That's correct.
[7]Q All right. And it is noted that that bone
[8]spur was impinging on the neural foraminal at that
[9]level, correct?
[10]A That's correct
[11]Q All right. As far as the Plaintiff's current
[12]condition is concerned, you would agree that she, by her
[13]own admission, that she is doing very well right now?
[14]A That's correct.
[15]Q And that her pain is virtually none in terms
[16]of her neck pain?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q All right. And that -- that she has no
[19]radiculopathy anymore?
[20]A Correct.
[21]Q And that she is basically doing all of her
[22]normal activities?
[23]A Yes.
[24]Q All right. And that she hasn't seen a
[25]neurosurgeon in over a year now?
[25]
[1]A Ahh --
[2]Q You're not aware of that?
[3]A Yeah, I'm not aware.
[4]Q All right. But when she comes in to see you
[5]now, is not -- it has nothing to do with the accident --
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q -- these are just the normal routine
[8]check-ups?
[9]A Normal routine visits. Physical examinations.
[10]Q As far as as far as you can tell from your
[11]standpoint as a primary care physician, your treatment
[12]of the patient from this time forward will have nothing
[13]to do with the accident, is that fair to say?
[14]A Most likely.
[15]MR. SIERRA: All right Doctor, that's all I
[16]have. Thank you.
[17]MS. LOPEZ: I don't any follow-up regarding
[18]the video, but before we go off the record I just
[19]want to attach her CV as Number 1 and her file as
[20]Number 2.
[21]Thank you, Doctor.
[22](Plaintiff's Exhibit Nos. 1 and 2 were marked
[23]for identification.)
[24]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This concludes the video
[25]deposition of Dr. Chang. We're off the record. The
[26]
[1]time is approximately 2:35.
[2]MS. LOPEZ: You have the right to read or
[3]waive the review of the transcript regarding the
[4]deposition. Essentially what it means, if you
[5]think this young lady got something wrong, you
[6]know, you meant to say yes, you could put there, I
[7]mean no versus yes, or, you know, if she's got
[8]something you said incorrectly, you have the right
[9]to review it and state, you know, that you meant to
[10]say this or she typed something down wrong. Most
[11]people waive the reading.
[12]THE WITNESS: I concur.
