[24]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[25]Q. Good morning, sir.
  Page 15
[1]A. Good morning.
[2]Q. My name is Kirby Griffis, and we have just
[3]met; is that correct?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. Would you please pronounce your name for
[6]the jury? I want to get it right today.
[7]A. Chadi, Chadi, is my first name.
[8]Nabhan, Nabhan, is my last name.
[9]Q. Chadi Nabhan -- Nabhan?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. Thank you.
[12](Nabhan Exhibit 1 marked for
[13]identification.)
[14]Q. I've marked as Exhibit 1 and I'm handing
[15]you a copy of your current CV.
[16]Have I correctly identified that document,
[17]sir?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. Okay. The "Summary" section at the top of
[20]your CV in bold says that you are vice president and
[21]chief medical officer of an $ 11 billion division in
[22]a Fortune 15 company; is that right?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. What is the division?
[25]A. Specialty Solutions.
  Page 16
[1]Q. And what is the Fortune 15 company?
[2]A. Cardinal Health. That's my current
[3]position.
[4]Q. What does -- okay. It's your current
[5]position.
[6]Has your position changed?
[7]A. No, no.
[8]Q. What is a Fortune 15 company? What does
[9]that mean?
[10]A. Fortune magazine, they have a list of the
[11]companies every year that they come up with, and
[12]they reflect 500 of the top companies in the U.S.
[13]Q. And they're top companies in what way?
[14]A. I think they have a variety of metrics.
[15]I'm not really sure what they are. I have not
[16]looked at the metrics per se that they use. But
[17]could be sales, revenue, culture, employee
[18]retention. I'm not really clear what they use.
[19]Q. Okay. The next bullet says that you're a
[20]senior level executive and a member of the operating
[21]company, reporting directly to the president;
[22]correct?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. Under "Professional Experience," you list
[25]the positions that you've held in the past and
  Page 17
[1]currently.
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. This is also on the first page.
[4]And the first one is your current position
[5]that you've just been describing, vice president and
[6]chief medical officer of Cardinal Health; is that
[7]right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. And underneath that, there are 16 bullets
[10]describing your various duties as someone who
[11]reports to the president of Cardinal Health
[12]Specialty Solutions; is that right?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. How much time do you spend in your current
[15]position, sir, on this job on business and
[16]administrative tasks?
[17]A. About 80 percent and 20 percent research.
[18]Q. And how much time seeing cancer patients?
[19]A. At this point, I'm not seeing patients by
[20]choice. It's been about 11 months since I've seen
[21]actual patients because of my travel schedule.
[22]I have the flexibility of having a clinic
[23]or seeing patients if I choose to. It's been very
[24]challenging with my travel to make sure that I can
[25]have a dedicated day for clinic. I don't want to
  Page 18
[1]shortchange my patients and cancel clinic because of
[2]short notice, so this is still in the works.
[3]Q. So at the time -- at this time, it's been
[4]11 months since you've seen a patient?
[5]A. That is correct.
[6]Q. And --
[7]A. I continue, however, to, you know, lecture,
[8]publish, and work on the field; but I have not seen
[9]an actual patient in 11 months.
[10]Q. Yes, sir.
[11]You said 20 percent of your time is on
[12]research; right?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions, would
[15]you describe that as a service provider to hospitals
[16]and doctors' offices?
[17]A. Hospitals, biopharma, and doctors, yes.
[18]Q. And it provides help with all sorts of
[19]logistical things with supply chains, with billing,
[20]with administration, all sorts of --
[21]A. Yeah, I mean --
[22]Q. -- difficulties?
[23]A. I think, you know, there are -- again,
[24]there are two major segments within Cardinal Health.
[25]One, the medical segment that works a lot with
  Page 19
[1]supply chain hospitals, and so forth. And there's
[2]the biopharma segment to work with providers as well
[3]as with biopharma, providing a lot of logistical
[4]help as well as educational platforms, helping with
[5]billing, et cetera.
[6]Q. You recently got an MBA; is that right?
[7]A. It's been a year.
[8]Q. Okay. Not recently?
[9]A. That's recent. No, it's recent, 2016.
[10]Q. And you got an MBA, I presume, in support
[11]of your current role as a business person; is that
[12]right?
[13]A. I actually decided to go back on the -- to
[14]get my MBA when I was at the University of Chicago
[15]as the director of the cancer center -- the clinical
[16]cancer center and cancer clinics. And I wanted to
[17]better understand the economics, business,
[18]accountings, which will help in my role at the time.
[19]So I got the MBA focusing on healthcare
[20]management. My goal was to help more patients at a
[21]larger scale. And, you know, this opportunity came
[22]along after the fact that I was already on the MBA.
[23]This was not -- my current role is not why I got the
[24]MBA. That is -- I got -- I went back to school in
[25]August 2014. I was still at the University of
  Page 20
[1]Chicago.
[2]My goal was just to better understand
[3]business of medicine. I think what's going on in
[4]medicine is very important for physicians to take
[5]lead into understanding business and the impact on
[6]patients.
[7]Q. It reflected a shift in your interest from
[8]patient care to a more broad administration and
[9]business side and serving medicine through that
[10]means. Is that fair to say?
[11]A. No, I don't think it's fair to say. I
[12]think -- I think delivering patient care is both
[13]sides, right. I mean, I think when you take care of
[14]patients in clinic, you still have to bill for
[15]services. You have to run a business.
[16]So being able to deliver quality care to
[17]patients implies that you know how to run your
[18]business.
[19]Q. Yes, sir.
[20]And you're focused now --
[21]A. So I think it's important to do both.
[22]Q. You're focused now on the business side?
[23]A. I am focused on the business side, but I
[24]don't think it's irrelevant to patient care.
[25]Q. You, sir, are not an epidemiologist, and
  Page 21
[1]you never were one; is that right?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. You're not a toxicologist, and you never
[4]were one; right?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. You don't call yourself an expert in the
[7]mechanisms of carcinogenesis; is that right?
[8]A. I'm not an expert in the mechanism of
[9]carcinogenesis. I can understand the papers that
[10]discuss carcinogenesis, and I try my best to look
[11]into how this might imply clinical decisions in
[12]clinical care.
[13](Nabhan Exhibit 2 marked for
[14]identification.)
[15]Q. I've marked as an -- Exhibit 2 a May 16th,
[16]2017, letter from Weitz & Luxenberg to Heather
[17]Pigman at Hollingsworth, LLP, sir. And the -- I
[18]will read the letter. You will follow along with me
[19]and make sure I get it right.
[20]"Dear, Heather: To follow up on our letter
[21]dated May 3rd, 2017, and to respond to your inquiry
[22]about our expert specialties, we provide the
[23]following information."
[24]And then there is a list of six experts,
[25]including yourself, with a very brief description of
   ?
  Page 22
[1]their specialties; is that right, sir?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. For you, it says "oncology" and "NHL,"
[4]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; is that right?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. Does that accurately reflect your
[7]understanding of your role in this litigation?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And you know that there are epidemiologists
[10]and toxicologists who have also been named as
[11]experts for the plaintiffs; is that right?
[12]A. I do.
[13]Q. And what do you -- what is your
[14]understanding of what you add to what the
[15]epidemiologists have to say and what the
[16]toxicologists have to say on the issue of whether
[17]glyphosate is capable of causing non-Hodgkin's
[18]lymphoma?
[19]A. So I think -- I think, as somebody who took
[20]care of patients with lymphomas and a variety of
[21]lymphoid malignancies, it is very important to look
[22]at the overall body of literature and understand
[23]what might cause the disease that I'm treating.
[24]A, it actually helps in a conversation with
[25]patients. B, it might allow the ability to be
  Page 23
[1]proactive into preventing additional exposure if
[2]there's a particular pathogen that might actually --
[3]causing an issue.
[4]There's -- it's similar to when you take
[5]care of a patient who is a smoker and has a
[6]particular malignancy. If you reduce or stop
[7]tobacco use, you will actually prevent another
[8]malignancy that could occur. So actually
[9]understanding the epidemiologic evidence is very
[10]critical to clinical care.
[11]Q. Yes, sir.
[12]And you have explained, I believe, why it
[13]would be important to --
[14]A. Right.
[15]Q. -- a cancer doctor --
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. -- to look at some of the epidemiology and
[18]toxicology. My question a little bit different,
[19]though.
[20]It is this: With regard to the scientific
[21]question of whether glyphosate causes non-Hodgkin's
[22]lymphoma or is capable of causing non-Hodgkin's
[23]lymphoma, once epidemiologists have spoken to that
[24]subject and toxicologists have spoken to that
[25]subject, what expertise do you bring, what
  Page 24
[1]perspective do you bring to the scientific question
[2]does glyphosate cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[3]A. Well, number one is I could interpret the
[4]evidence as well. I am very capable of looking at
[5]the literature and looking at the epidemiological
[6]literature. Just because I don't have an
[7]epidemiology degree and -- it does not mean that I
[8]cannot actually interpret the literature and look at
[9]the actual evidence.
[10]So I -- I will -- I form my own independent
[11]review of the available literature, and I put that
[12]into clinical perspective. That's what I bring to
[13]the table.
[14]Q. And what do you -- what can you say that an
[15]epidemiologist or toxicologist cannot say?
[16]A. Well, I'm not a toxicologist, as we just
[17]established. I mean, a toxicologist is able to look
[18]at the -- at the evidence when the product or
[19]compound is going through the process of being
[20]approved through toxicology assays, through animal
[21]studies, et cetera.
[22]I don't do that. I just look at the
[23]literature and review the literature.
[24]Q. You never conducted an animal cancer
[25]bioassay; right?
  Page 25
[1]A. I have not.
[2]Q. You've never conducted an experimental
[3]genotoxicity study; right?
[4]A. I have not.
[5]Q. You've never conducted a study assessing
[6]the possibility that a particular chemical exposure
[7]or pharmaceutical exposure or other kind of exposure
[8]causes oxidative stress; is that right?
[9]A. I worked -- when I was a fellow at
[10]Northwestern, I worked for three years doing bench
[11]work and lab work. And part of my work at the time
[12]was doing certain cytotoxicity assays of particular
[13]drugs to understand what they actually impact cells
[14]and on cell culture.
[15]So we did a lot of apoptotic assays, and so
[16]forth, as part of my fellowship training. That's
[17]the extent of what I did in terms of lab work.
[18]I'm not sure if that answers your question.
[19]Q. Yes, sir.
[20]Did any of those involve -- you were
[21]talking about cytotoxicity studies.
[22]A. Cytotoxicity, apoptotic assays, and so
[23]forth.
[24]Q. Were any of those looking at reactive
[25]oxidative species or other oxidative stress markers?
   ?
   r
   g
   .
   l erature
  Page 26
[1]A. No, we did not -- I did not do these
[2]assays.
[3]Q. You say in your expert report, sir, that
[4]you are a specialty in -- you have specialty in
[5]diagnosis and management.
[6]A. Of?
[7]Q. Patients, I presume.
[8]A. Can you show me where that is?
[9]Q. Certainly.
[10]A. It seems like the sentence is truncated.
[11](Nabhan Exhibit 3 marked for
[12]identification.)
[13]MR. GRIFFIS: Do you need a copy, Tim?
[14]A. What page?
[15]Q. One.
[16]A. So it says, "Diagnosis and management of
[17]patients with all types of lymphoma, including
[18]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
[19]Q. Yes, sir.
[20]What do you mean by "diagnosis and
[21]management"?
[22]A. It means I specialize in diagnosing
[23]patients who have lymphoid malignancies, because
[24]lymphomas are very heterogenous. There's not one
[25]type of lymphoma, so you really have to diagnose the
  Page 27
[1]type of lymphoma the patient has because the proper
[2]diagnosis will lead to the proper management.
[3]So once I diagnose a patient, then I will
[4]take care of designing a therapeutic regimen for
[5]that patient and implement that therapy.
[6]Q. So your specialty, when you were seeing
[7]patients, was in diagnosing, which would include
[8]both determining that they had cancer at all and in
[9]determining which specific subtype of cancer, and
[10]here, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that they had; is that
[11]correct?
[12]A. I was a lymphoma specialist. So I did not
[13]see breast cancer. I did not see lung cancer. So
[14]the patients that I saw, they all had lymphoma. I
[15]had a small clinic of prostate cancer as well
[16]because I had a little bit of an interest in
[17]prostate cancer. But the bulk of the patients, I
[18]saw lymphomas.
[19]So it's either a patient who has a known
[20]lymphoma that I will verify, confirm the diagnosis,
[21]and design a treatment plan or someone with a
[22]suspicion of lymphoma that the oncologist referring
[23]to me is not certain. And they will send to me, and
[24]I make the diagnosis.
[25]So my area of expertise is lymphoma. I
  Page 28
[1]didn't see other -- I didn't see general oncology.
[2]Q. Yes, sir.
[3]And you alluded to the heterogenous nature
[4]of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
[5]Would you explain that, please?
[6]A. So, you know, every few years, there's a
[7]classification of lymphoid malignancies that changes
[8]based on, you know, better understanding of the
[9]science of lymphoma. So the last classification was
[10]actually published in the journal Blood in 2016 last
[11]year by the WHO, the World Health Organization, and
[12]pretty much divides lymphomas into almost 60, 6-0,
[13]subtypes. And it's very critical for oncologists as
[14]well as -- as well as patients to know which type of
[15]lymphoma the patient has to decide the therapy that
[16]the person needs.
[17]So, in general, we divide lymphomas into
[18]Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin. Hodgkin lymphoma is
[19]divided, in my opinion, into two categories,
[20]classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte
[21]predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.
[22]The non-Hodgkin lymphoma broadly is divided
[23]into B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. And then
[24]within T-cell, you have about 20 to 25 types.
[25]Within the B-cell, you have about 40 types.
  Page 29
[1]So you can see how complex it could be
[2]because each one has a different prognosis,
[3]treatment, management, et cetera.
[4]I mean, I could group them for you, if you
[5]want, into broader categories. But for the most
[6]part, it's very important for us to know which type
[7]we're dealing with.
[8]Q. There's also a great deal of etiologic
[9]heterogeneity in the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas;
[10]correct?
[11]A. For some. I think, you know, there are
[12]some lymphomas, as an example, that are associated
[13]with -- that are associated with viruses,
[14]Epstein-Barr virus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HIV; HHV;
[15]HTLV. All of these and -- you know, all of these --
[16]HSV. All of these viruses could be associated with
[17]a particular type of lymphoma.
[18]In general, however, when we look at
[19]epidemiology or we look at certain particular
[20]aspects, we can look at lymphomas as a collective
[21]one homogenous group despite the heterogeneity.
[22]I mean, I can give you an analogous
[23]example. So smoking is associated with lung cancer,
[24]but there are about six types of lung cancer. But
[25]you can look at the association between tobacco and
  Page 30
[1]lung cancer in general, and then you could look at
[2]other particular types.
[3]Q. Sir, I've marked as Exhibit 4 a scientific
[4]article entitled "Comprehensive evaluation of
[5]medical conditions associated with risk of
[6]non-Hodgkin lymphoma using Medicare Claims
[7]('MedWAS')," by Engels and others.
[8]Are you familiar with this article from
[9]2016?
[10]A. I have never seen it.
[11]Q. Take a look in the "Introduction" section,
[12]sir.
[13]A. Sure.
[14]Q. The second -- the third sentence reads,
[15]"Although considered a single entity for descriptive
[16]purposes, NHL comprises a group of heterogenous
[17]subtypes with distinct clinical presentations and,
[18]as is increasingly recognized, differing causal
[19]pathways, i.e., etiologic heterogeneity."
[20]MR. LITZENBURG: I object to the
[21]questions --
[22]Q. Do you agree with that?
[23]MR. LITZENBURG: -- questions about
[24]something he's never seen before and did not
[25]rely on.
  Page 31
[1]With that objection, you can answer if you
[2]like.
[3]Q. Do you agree with that, sir?
[4]A. I don't. I think -- I think there are two
[5]ways of looking at things. I think sometimes
[6]certain lymphomas could have one causal factor and
[7]some others don't. So I think it's making a blank
[8]statement that takes away, frankly, from -- from the
[9]actual clinical encounters that we see with
[10]patients.
[11]Q. And this is based on clinical encounters
[12]rather than scientific literature, sir?
[13]A. And scientific literature, of course.
[14]Q. And what scientific literature says that?
[15]A. So HIV, as an example, I'll bring that,
[16]it's a known viral infection. It could cause
[17]Hodgkin lymphoma, could cause Burkitt lymphoma,
[18]could cause diffused large B-cell lymphoma. But
[19]it's one factor.
[20]So I think that you could look sometimes --
[21]the variety of lymphomas, we want causality. So you
[22]can't really make a general statement that -- that
[23]every single one is different or together.
[24]There are a variety of lymphomas, as we
[25]just talked about, the last WHO classification. And
  Page 32
[1]some of them could be grouped and have one causal
[2]factor or two causal factors, and some don't. There
[3]are many lymphomas we don't even know why they
[4]happen. I mean, they just happen.
[5]Q. Which lymphomas, that involve more than
[6]1 percent of the total lymphomas, do we not know why
[7]they happen?
[8]A. I don't understand the question.
[9]MR. LITZENBURG: I object to form.
[10]Q. Yes, sir.
[11]What -- which specific subtypes
[12]involving -- and I don't want a microscopic subtype
[13]with -- that's only .1 percent of all the
[14]non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
[15]But, say, 1 percent or greater of the
[16]non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which subtypes are unknown
[17]in their etiology?
[18]MR. LITZENBURG: Same objection.
[19]A. So it is my opinion that just because we
[20]have a patient in front of me that -- that has a
[21]lymphoma and I couldn't find an identifying factor
[22]that it occurred, it doesn't mean that there is no
[23]factor. It just means I'm not able to identify it
[24]at the time.
[25]20, 30 years ago, we only thought lymphomas
  Page 33
[1]were about four types. Hodgkin lymphoma was one
[2]disease. Now it's five diseases. Large-cell
[3]lymphoma was one entity. It is now about six
[4]entities.
[5]So science does evolve and does change. So
[6]I don't know today, as I sit here, what type of
[7]lymphomas we -- you have to give me a clinical case,
[8]a particular patient situation where I'll look at
[9]all the factors and I say okay, well, with this
[10]patient, I'm not sure why this lymphoma occurred.
[11]In the other patient, I may find a reason.
[12]There are about -- about close to 15,000
[13]new patients with lung cancer in the United States
[14]that are never smokers. We -- when I was in
[15]training, we had no idea, actually, why would
[16]somebody with no smoking history get lung cancer.
[17]Five, six years ago, there was a mutation
[18]that was identified that leads to a particular
[19]development of these cancers. So things evolve. I
[20]don't know -- I don't have any other answer to the
[21]question you posed.
[22]Q. Did you tell me a few minutes ago, sir,
[23]that there are some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[24]for which the cause is unknown?
[25]A. Yes, I did.
  Page 34
[1]Q. What are those types?
[2]A. Again, any type of lymphoma, any type -- so
[3]you have 60 types of lymphoma. Any type of them,
[4]you may be able to identify why they occurred.
[5]Could be a chromosomal aberration, a genetic
[6]mutation, et cetera. And you may not be able to.
[7]Each case is different.
[8]There is no particular type that you say,
[9]well, this one, I have no idea why it occurs; but,
[10]this one, I know why it occurred. In any type of
[11]lymphoma, you can't always find a predisposing
[12]factor; while in others you can. Each case is very
[13]different. I can't generalize.
[14]Q. Lymphoma is very strongly associated with
[15]age; correct?
[16]A. It does occur in patients who are older as
[17]opposed to younger, correct.
[18]Q. Age is a major risk factor for all types of
[19]lymphoma; correct?
[20]A. For all types of cancer.
[21]Q. And that is because --
[22]A. You don't see cancers in 30-year-olds,
[23]commonly. So I think, you know, what happens as we
[24]age is a lot of cellular disruption occurs, and you
[25]see the majority of cancers occur in patients over
  Page 35
[1]the age of 65. The majority of cancer-related
[2]deaths occur over 65, in Medicare population.
[3]Q. And that is because of the ongoing process
[4]of cell division, cell replication, and endogenous
[5]errors creeping into that process as the years pass;
[6]correct?
[7]A. That's only one factor. I think there are
[8]other factors that actually are involved. As we get
[9]older, whatever things that have occurred in the
[10]past start accumulate for us. So you could smoke in
[11]your 30s all you want; you probably won't get cancer
[12]until the mid 50s.
[13]The point being is certain occupational
[14]hazards, certain factors that we've done in our
[15]youth may not actually pan out until later in age.
[16]You add this to the age and cellular division and
[17]other things, so together that's really why we see
[18]most cancers diagnosed in patients over 65 and most
[19]cancer-related deaths occur in patients over 65.
[20]Q. What -- what is the latency period from an
[21]environmental insult -- you mentioned smoking just
[22]now, sir -- to the manifestation of a cancer?
[23]A. It varies. It varies significantly. And
[24]I'm not sure, really, anyone could be certain or
[25]accurate in saying if it's 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.
  Page 36
[1]It's really impossible.
[2]Because what happens is, in order for you
[3]to accurately determine a latency period, you are
[4]going to say that your exposure to whatever that is
[5]has to be constant and stable for all of these
[6]coming years. It has not to go up or down. What if
[7]you -- you know, you smoked one pack of cigarettes a
[8]day for 10 years and then you decide three packs of
[9]cigarettes a day for the next 10 years. Your
[10]latency changes. Your exposure changes.
[11]So I don't think we can accurately predict
[12]a latency period for a malignancy that it is -- it's
[13]not a binary option. You know what I mean? It's
[14]not 5 years less or more, 10 years less or more, 15
[15]years less or more.
[16]Q. Yes, sir. But when you're doing something
[17]like epidemiology and relying on statistics, what
[18]latency period would you like to see in an
[19]epidemiology study before you would consider the
[20]results to be actually reflecting a possible result
[21]of the exposure that you're looking at?
[22]A. I don't rely on the latency period per se
[23]to make a decision whether there is -- the exposure
[24]has any relation to that because every disease is
[25]different.
  Page 37
[1]So the latency period per se is not a
[2]factor, in my opinion, to make a determination in
[3]terms of exposure-related developed of disease.
[4]Q. And it's not a factor in considering the
[5]adequacy of an epidemiology study, sir?
[6]A. No, I didn't say that. I said it's not --
[7]you can't take it as a binary option. You can't
[8]take it as a one factor. There are a variety of
[9]factors involved in making that determination, and
[10]the latency period, in my opinion, is not the most
[11]important factor in making that determination.
[12]That's what I said.
[13]Q. Okay. I'm talking about epidemiology
[14]studies right now.
[15]A. Sure.
[16]Q. In an epidemiology study, sir, what period
[17]of time would you like to see between the exposure
[18]under consideration and the manifestation of the
[19]diseases being measured to consider that there may
[20]be a valid relationship between the exposure and the
[21]diseases?
[22]A. So I will repeat my answer, because I
[23]already answered this. I don't believe -- I don't
[24]need a minimum or a maximum. The latency period --
[25]there is no minimum or a maximum period that a
  Page 38
[1]latency period has to have in order for you to
[2]believe that an exposure was related to a
[3]development of disease. And I will stop at that.
[4]Q. Okay. Sir, do you know that the
[5]epidemiologists or plaintiffs in this case have
[6]criticized the agricultural health study in part for
[7]the short latency period, the -- what they call the
[8]short period of time between the exposures and the
[9]manifestation of cancer and say that's not long
[10]enough to detect cancer?
[11]MR. LITZENBURG: I object to that
[12]characterization.
[13]Go ahead.
[14]A. If he did, that's his opinion.
[15]Q. Okay. And you disagree?
[16]A. I didn't say I disagree. Again --
[17]Q. Do you agree?
[18]A. Well, if you let me just finish, what I
[19]said is that latency period -- there is no minimum
[20]or a maximum latency period that is needed for me as
[21]a clinician, as a lymphoma researcher, to determine
[22]that the exposure was related to disease. That's
[23]what I said.
[24]Q. Okay. And are you talking about in an
[25]individual patient?
  Page 39
[1]A. No. In any patient there is no such a
[2]thing as you have to have a minimum exposure or a
[3]maximum exposure. I mean, a latency period --
[4]you're trying to treat latency period as such a
[5]binary option that, you know, in order for you
[6]have -- you have to have a minimum latency period of
[7]5 years or 10 years or 15 years to -- to have a
[8]valid study.
[9]That's not how it works. There is no such
[10]a thing as an actual number that has to be fulfilled
[11]in order for us to buy into the results or the
[12]output of an epidemiologic study from a latency
[13]period perspective.
[14]Q. So you do not consider a short latency
[15]period to be a valid criticism of an epidemiology
[16]study looking at cancer causation. Is what that
[17]you're trying to say?
[18]A. If you are trying to equate latency period
[19]with a follow-up, you may want to clarify this
[20]because I would say follow-up, short follow-up, in
[21]any study is always something to be criticized,
[22]because you want to follow up patients longer to
[23]understand what actually happens.
[24]So maybe you want to clarify for me. If
[25]you're thinking latency as a follow-up or you're
  Page 40
[1]thinking -- because latency, to my understanding, is
[2]before you even started a study, before you even
[3]started the follow-up. Right? I mean, if you
[4]design a study today, in 2017, and you want to
[5]follow-up patients until 2020, the latency period
[6]would be probably since 1990, before 2017.
[7]I think the follow-up, short follow-up, is
[8]always a major criticism in any study, frankly,
[9]whether it's interventional, observational,
[10]epidemiologic, any study. And I do quite -- my
[11]share of peer review -- I peer review papers for
[12]over ten journals. So short follow-up is always a
[13]red flag for us.
[14]But if you want to clarify for me what you
[15]mean by "latency," because maybe we're mixing
[16]latency with follow-up.
[17]Q. Sir, whether you call it follow-up or
[18]whether you call it latency --
[19]A. They're different, sir. They're different.
[20]Latency is different than follow-up.
[21]Q. They're different terms in terms of the
[22]design of the study; but in either case, they refer
[23]to a period of time between the exposure --
[24]A. But that's not true.
[25]Q. -- and the manifestation of the disease;
  Page 41
[1]correct?
[2]A. The follow-up starts from the day you
[3]started the study. I just gave you an example. If
[4]we design a study today, in 2017, my follow-up
[5]starts in 2017.
[6]Q. And if you are looking --
[7]A. And the latency period would be probably
[8]10 years before the patients that were enrolled in
[9]2017 in the study had been exposed to for the past
[10]10 years. That's the latency.
[11]Q. And if you're looking at historical
[12]exposures 20 years old, why would it matter if you
[13]did any follow-up? If you looked at --
[14]A. Can you repeat the question?
[15]Q. Yes, sir.
[16]If you were looking at patients who were
[17]exposed 20 years ago --
[18]A. Uh-hum.
[19]Q. -- and then looking today whether they have
[20]cancer, why would it matter whether you added an
[21]additional follow-up period to that?
[22]A. Well, because, you know, with more
[23]follow-up, additional information will be generated.
[24]I mean, it's just -- this is common sense for us who
[25]do clinical research. I mean, you need longer
  Page 42
[1]follow-up to make sure that you separate the noise
[2]from the truth.
[3]Q. One criticism that you had of the DeRoos
[4]2005 study, the agricultural health study data, was
[5]relatively short follow-up; is that right?
[6]A. Do you mind showing me that paper?
[7]Q. Sure. You have your expert report there;
[8]right?
[9]A. Sure. It's Exhibit 3.
[10]Q. Yes.
[11]A. I reviewed a lot of papers, so sometimes a
[12]refresher will help so I could provide you with the
[13]accurate answers.
[14]Q. On page 18 of your expert report, you're
[15]talking about some findings of the EPA SAP Panel
[16]review; correct?
[17]A. Yes. I see that.
[18]Q. Yes.
[19]And about halfway down, you say, "The EPA
[20]clearly criticized the EHA publication, DeRoos,
[21]et al. 2005, for its limited follow-up period."
[22]Is that a criticism that you shared?
[23]A. Yes, I do. Like, not just with -- any
[24]study with limited follow-up, in my opinion, is
[25]always -- could be always criticized.
  Page 43
[1]Q. And the previous sentence says, "In fact,
[2]the panel recommended the EPA contact the HS
[3]investigators to determine whether updated data on
[4]incidents of NHL and other cancers are available."
[5]Do you see that?
[6]A. I see that.
[7]Q. And do you share the view that the HS
[8]investigators should be contacted to determine
[9]whether updated data is available?
[10]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[11]THE WITNESS: Sorry?
[12]MR. LITZENBURG: I just make objections
[13]from time to time.
[14]If you can answer it, you are welcome to.
[15]A. Okay. I apologize. Would you read the
[16]question.
[17]Q. Yes, sir.
[18]Do you share the view that you express here
[19]and attribute to the panel that the AHS
[20]investigators should be contacted to determine
[21]whether updated data on incidence of NHL and other
[22]cancers are available, i.e., updated data from the
[23]DeRoos 2005?
[24]A. I do.
[25]Q. And do you know whether such data exists?
  Page 44
[1]A. I don't.
[2]Q. Have you been told about a draft paper from
[3]Alavanja, et al., from 2013, sir, with updated data?
[4]A. I have not seen that paper.
[5]Q. How did you decide which epidemiology
[6]studies to look at, sir?
[7]A. Through my research, through PubMed, Google
[8]Scholar, and the literature.
[9]Q. Were you provided with epidemiology studies
[10]or other studies by plaintiffs' counsel?
[11]A. I did my own independent research. And
[12]when I had some questions, I would contact the
[13]plaintiff counsel to -- if I need to.
[14]Q. Were you given any guidance as to what
[15]additional information might exist relevant to the
[16]question that you were asked to look at, i.e.,
[17]whether NHL can be caused by glyphosate?
[18]A. No. I was provided with the -- I reviewed
[19]the deposition of the epidemiologist. I don't
[20]know -- I don't know how his last name is -- Neugut.
[21]Q. You reviewed his deposition?
[22]A. I did review it, yes.
[23]Q. Okay. And did you look at any of the
[24]studies discussed therein that you had not
[25]previously looked at?
  Page 45
[1]A. I don't honestly recall if I reviewed
[2]additional papers based on what he actually stated.
[3]I just -- I did not go back and look at more papers
[4]based on his deposition. I just reviewed his
[5]deposition.
[6]Q. I'd like to go back to your CV for a
[7]moment, sir.
[8]A. Sure.
[9]Q. You list a number of publications there.
[10]Did any of them involved assessing whether a
[11]particular substance causes cancer?
[12]A. A particular?
[13]Q. Particular substance?
[14]A. Causes cancer?
[15]Q. Causes cancer, yes.
[16]A. Not particularly, no.
[17]Q. Did any of your publications involve you
[18]reviewing the science and epidemiology on whether a
[19]particular substance causes cancer, i.e., for
[20]example, a review article?
[21]A. Not a particular substance. We did a lot
[22]of research through the CR database and other things
[23]to look at disparities and outcomes, and so forth,
[24]but we did not -- I did not personally review a
[25]particular substance per se.
  Page 46
[1]Q. Other than the work that you have done for
[2]plaintiffs' counsel in this case, have you been
[3]called upon to conduct a scientific review in the
[4]past of whether a particular substance causes
[5]cancer?
[6]A. As part of my peer review. Like I said, I
[7]review for a lot of journals and some of the
[8]manuscripts that get submitted, which I can't
[9]disclose because that's how we do peer review. So
[10]if I'm asked to review a paper, then I -- I do that.
[11]Q. Other than peer -- I'm talking about your
[12]own work, though, sir. As part of your own work,
[13]have you conducted such a study or done such a
[14]review?
[15]A. No. The only one that I just thought of --
[16]it's been a while back -- was a 2004 paper that --
[17]I'll let you know where it is -- we looked at a
[18]compound. It's a radioimmunotherapy for lymphoma,
[19]and it showed a secondary leukemia. But I'm going
[20]to tell you exactly where that is.
[21]Okay. One second. So these are the
[22]abstracts or -- these are the abstracts. Okay. So
[23]make sure I show you the . . .
[24]Well, I can't believe we didn't write this
[25]paper. This is a paper that I wrote in 2004 in
  Page 47
[1]Leukemia & lymphoma on the association of Zevalin,
[2]which is a radioimmunotherapy that is used for
[3]lymphoma and secondary leukemia. And I just
[4]realized it's not even put in my -- maybe -- there's
[5]no way I should have put it in -- just do one last
[6]attempt at it, because maybe you -- oh, here it is,
[7]I think, on page 12, Reference No. 65. It's
[8]actually '02.
[9]So this is a secondary acute myeloid
[10]leukemia with MLL gene rearrangement following
[11]radioimmunotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This
[12]is -- radioimmunotherapy is a form of treatment that
[13]we give for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It was
[14]associated with the secondary malignancy.
[15]So I just recall that this is one of the
[16]things that you could consider looking at in
[17]association between a particular therapy and cancer.
[18]Q. Was this a case report?
[19]A. Yes. And it was one of the few case
[20]reports that looked at particular rearrangements
[21]that we discovered after radioimmunotherapy.
[22]Q. Okay. So to sum up, then, the one
[23]publication in your CV in which you assess the issue
[24]of whether a particular substance caused a
[25]particular cancer was a case report; is that right?
  Page 48
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. And the one you just identified.
[3]And for the jury's sake, a case report is
[4]an anecdotal report by a physician or by anyone of
[5]an observation that we expose someone to this
[6]particular substance and this outcome occurred?
[7]A. Well, a case report, to be published in
[8]Leukemia & lymphoma, has to go to through a strict
[9]peer-review process, and you have to -- when you say
[10]that a particular compound causes ML gene
[11]rearrangement, I had to show that the actual genes
[12]were rearranged.
[13]So it does -- while it is a case report, it
[14]does go through the same peer-review process and
[15]rigorous peer review to be published. You can't
[16]just publish any case report. I've had many case
[17]reports rejected, so it's okay.
[18]Q. Yes, sir.
[19]The new -- I mean, the new data in a case
[20]report is the observation, and it is surrounded
[21]by --
[22]A. Sure.
[23]Q. -- the scientific context, which involves
[24]research and additional --
[25]A. Correct.
  Page 49
[1]Q. -- writings. That's what you were just
[2]discussing; right?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. Okay, sir.
[5]Would you tell me, before we turn away from
[6]your CV, sir, where else in your past publications
[7]you have used the Bradford Hill criteria?
[8]A. I have not, in my publications, used the
[9]Bradford Hill criteria.
[10]Q. Where did you get the idea to use them in
[11]your work for plaintiffs' counsel, sir?
[12]A. Repeat the question.
[13]Q. Yes, sir.
[14]Where did you get the idea to use those in
[15]your expert report in your work for plaintiffs'
[16]counsel?
[17]A. Well, when you do -- I mean, I've been
[18]spending a lot of time looking at research and
[19]reviewing the literature, so it does pop up as some
[20]of the criteria that is -- that could be used to
[21]look at causality and look at the evidence.
[22]I also forgot -- I forgot if -- I mean, I
[23]read this, I think, and, again, my memory -- I think
[24]I read that in the IARC monograph, that it was -- it
[25]was looked at, but I'll have to refresh my memory
  Page 50
[1]if -- if they spelled out the Bradford Hill
[2]criteria.
[3]Q. Okay. So you got the idea to use the
[4]Bradford Hill criteria as a methodology to assess
[5]causation from the articles that you found when you
[6]were looking at the issue of glyphosate and
[7]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; is that fair?
[8]A. Not as the only methodology. I mean,
[9]you'll have -- you'll have to remember, really, that
[10]the Bradford Hill criteria or any criteria, for that
[11]matter, in medical literature is just simple
[12]guidelines tool. You have to take it in context.
[13]If you are going to just take any type of
[14]criteria and say "I'm going to follow this
[15]criteria," then a robot could do our job. It just
[16]doesn't work like this.
[17]You take the criteria, you take the
[18]guidelines, and you try to put in context into the
[19]clinical evidence that you see and see if it makes
[20]sense or not. You could disagree with some of the
[21]criteria; you could agree with some of the criteria.
[22]But all of the criteria that we have in medicine, in
[23]general there's supposed to be some guidelines that
[24]you take in context and you still use your clinical
[25]judgment. It's not to replace clinical judgment.
  Page 51
[1]Q. You choose -- you chose to organize your
[2]thoughts and your clinical judgment as expressed in
[3]your expert report in terms of the Bradford Hill
[4]criteria?
[5]A. I use it as part of my expert's report,
[6]that's correct.
[7]Q. And you got the idea to do that from the
[8]various -- from some of the various articles that
[9]you found in doing your research on the issue of
[10]glyphosate in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[11]A. I thought it was very reasonable to apply
[12]and just see if it fits or not.
[13]Q. Okay. You had no opinion on glyphosate and
[14]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before being retained by
[15]plaintiffs' counsel; correct?
[16]A. That is correct.
[17]Q. Turn to your expert report, please, sir.
[18]I'm on page 4. You said, "The opinions in this
[19]report are my own and are held to a reasonable
[20]degree of medical and scientific certainty."
[21]Then you said, "These opinions were formed
[22]after comprehensive review of medical literature
[23]focusing on epidemiologic studies and analyses, as
[24]well as my background, education, and experience."
[25]Would you explain, please, why your review
  Page 52
[1]was focused on epidemiologic studies and analyses,
[2]why you went to that part of the science.
[3]A. Well, because it's really -- it is -- in
[4]order for you to establish causality or to look at
[5]causality and between exposure to an occupational
[6]hazard or to anything that is -- you can't really
[7]have -- there would be never randomized study to say
[8]we can have a thousand patients and expose them to
[9]Compound A and a thousand patients, no exposure, and
[10]then we're going to see what happens. That clearly
[11]would be unethical and will never be done.
[12]So you really -- that's really the only way
[13]that you can go back and try to investigate the
[14]literature when you're looking at something like
[15]this.
[16]Q. And could you explain a little more why it
[17]is epidemiology that was your primary focus rather
[18]than toxicology or --
[19]A. I just did. I just said you can't --
[20]there's no prospective randomized trials that --
[21]Q. In humans?
[22]A. In humans, of course.
[23]Q. Right.
[24]A. I mean, in order for you to say that
[25]Compound A is associated with Disease B, you will
  Page 53
[1]need to have a randomized trial where you have a
[2]thousand patients that expose to Compound A and a
[3]thousand patients that are not exposed to Compound A
[4]and you follow it them through and see if one of
[5]them develop Disease B or not. And that will never
[6]happen in humans. It's unethical. It just didn't
[7]work like this.
[8]So in order for me to look at whether an
[9]exposure to glyphosate is -- causes non-Hodgkin's
[10]lymphoma, epidemiological studies are the ones that
[11]I have to use, just by default.
[12]Q. And what do you need to see in
[13]epidemiologic studies to conclude that a particular
[14]substance causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[15]A. I think you will need to see that the
[16]individuals, the people that were exposed to the
[17]compound in question have had increased risk of
[18]developing a particular malignancy. You want to see
[19]if there is a trend into developing this malignancy
[20]in these particular individuals, and then you look
[21]at the totality of evidence and try to form an
[22]opinion --
[23]Q. When you say --
[24]A. -- to the best of my ability.
[25]Q. Yes, sir.
  Page 54
[1]When you say that -- you would need to see
[2]that exposed people have increased risk, what
[3]constitutes increased risk in an epidemiology study?
[4]A. Anything above and beyond the folks who
[5]were not exposed that is clinically and/or
[6]statistically significant.
[7]Q. So you would need to see a statistically
[8]significant association in the studies?
[9]A. I'd like to, but sometimes you may not be
[10]able to establish statistical significance if
[11]there's not enough cases or not enough patients. I
[12]mean, there is -- obviously, you know, if you have
[13]thousands and thousands of patients, you probably
[14]need to see a statistical significance.
[15]Sometimes you can't because of the number
[16]of cases that you actually have, and then you look
[17]at trend. You look -- does it really make sense
[18]seeing the trend, and so forth.
[19]You always want -- you prefer to see
[20]statistical significance if you can, but the lack of
[21]statistical significance in an epidemiologic study
[22]does not, frankly, preclude the possibility of
[23]causation between a compound and a disease.
[24]Q. In -- is it your opinion, sir, having
[25]reviewed -- you said you made a comprehensive review
  Page 55
[1]of medical literature focusing on epidemiologic
[2]studies.
[3]Is it your opinion that the body of
[4]epidemiologic evidence is sufficient to detect with
[5]statistical significance an association between
[6]glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma if one exists?
[7]A. The short answer is yes, but I did not see
[8]statistical significance. I said that sometimes you
[9]may not see statistical significance and you still
[10]can establish the causation because it's a matter of
[11]number of cases and patients.
[12]In my opinion and based on my review, there
[13]is sufficient evidence that glyphosate has a
[14]causation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But the
[15]statistical significance part in your question may
[16]not be always established because, again, you look
[17]at powers of the study and the number of patients
[18]and you may not always see statistical significance.
[19]Q. You --
[20]A. Any clinician-researcher will tell you
[21]that. We've had situations in clinical trials where
[22]we -- the statistical significance was established,
[23]but that's because they -- they've had thousands and
[24]thousands of patients. And then you step back and
[25]say, well, is it really clinically meaningful and
  Page 56
[1]vice versa.
[2]Q. Yes, sir.
[3]I want to understand the answer that you
[4]just gave. It was a little long.
[5]A. Sorry.
[6]Q. Did you say that, in your view, the body of
[7]epidemiologic evidence that exists on the subject of
[8]glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is adequate to
[9]establish a statistically significant association if
[10]one exists?
[11]A. In my opinion, yes, but this does not mean
[12]that every study that I reviewed has statistical
[13]significance.
[14]Q. Yes, sir.
[15]And some of them do and some don't, in your
[16]opinion --
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. -- is that right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. Why is it that statistical significance is
[21]used in epidemiology, including in cancer
[22]epidemiology?
[23]A. You'd like to see it because you are more
[24]certain. You would just solidify your clinical
[25]opinion, if possible. But you have to acknowledge
  Page 57
[1]that you may not be always able to see it, in any
[2]study that you design, not just epidemiology.
[3]I mean, you do an interventional study and
[4]randomized trial and whatever it is. As you design
[5]the study, you establish a priori. And you say,
[6]okay, I'm going to power this study to establish
[7]statistical significance; and, based on that, I need
[8]500 patients randomized, 250 in one arm, 250 in the
[9]other arm. You establish that beforehand, and you
[10]proceed with the trial, and so forth. This is for
[11]interventional studies.
[12]So because -- in order for you to be more
[13]certain, you would like to show the statistical
[14]significance. When you see it, I think it's very
[15]important. When you don't see it, you go back and
[16]say, well, why didn't I see it? Is there really a
[17]trend? Is there not a trend? Were the numbers too
[18]small? Were there some issues in the study?
[19]So the lack of statistical significance, in
[20]my opinion, is not always a negative finding. It
[21]should be explained. People should look back and
[22]say, well, why was it not statistically significant?
[23]What was something special in this trial or in this
[24]study that was not in the other study?
[25]Q. Please explain what "confounding" is.
  Page 58
[1]A. Confounding --
[2]Q. Yes.
[3]A. -- factors, you mean?
[4]Q. What is --
[5]A. Confounding factors.
[6]Q. What is the concept of confounding in
[7]epidemiology and cancer epidemiology?
[8]A. That's -- the concept -- and, again, I'm
[9]not an epidemiologist, so I'll answer to the best of
[10]my ability.
[11]Q. Yes, sir.
[12]A. The confounding factors means that exposed
[13]individuals may be also exposed to additional
[14]elements or factors that may -- may impact the
[15]causation or the association of the disease in
[16]question.
[17]Q. And when it is possible to statistically
[18]control for a confounding factor, then the adjusted
[19]data is more valuable than the unadjusted data;
[20]correct?
[21]A. I think if you all -- if you can control
[22]for confounding factors, it's always -- it's always
[23]a good thing to do. You will have to control for
[24]both arms of each study -- of any study, and I --
[25]what I've seen in many of the papers -- I'm not
  Page 59
[1]talking about the review here but as a peer reviewer
[2]for many journals, sometimes the control doesn't
[3]happen in a balanced way between both arms.
[4]But you're correct. If you can control for
[5]confounding factors, you should at least try. You
[6]should at least attempt to do it. You sometimes
[7]can't always do it. I mean, there are certain
[8]things you just can't control for. Especially you
[9]can't, you know -- especially in epidemiology. I
[10]mean, these are not patients that are coming and
[11]seeing you in the office every week where you're
[12]taking what medicine they're taking, et cetera.
[13]But you are accurate. You are correct that
[14]you can try.
[15]Q. Sir, can you name for me three substances
[16]that are generally accepted to oncologists to cause
[17]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for which there are
[18]epidemiology studies and those studies are negative,
[19]i.e., do not show a statistically significant
[20]association between that substance and non-Hodgkin's
[21]lymphoma?
[22]A. To my knowledge, there is no data to
[23]suggest that smoking is associated with non-Hodgkin
[24]lymphoma. And alcohol is not associated with
[25]non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to the best of my knowledge.
  Page 60
[1]These are substances that are commonly used
[2]by folks. While there is good evidence that smoking
[3]is associated with certain malignancies, bladder
[4]cancer and lung cancer. Certain amounts of alcohol,
[5]especially with tobacco, is associated with
[6]esophageal cancer and other things.
[7]That's the answer I have.
[8]Q. Okay. So that I understand your answer,
[9]are you saying that those are generally accepted by
[10]oncologists to cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[11]A. I said do not. I said, in my opinion --
[12]you asked me the question to provide you -- maybe we
[13]go back and repeat the question so I answer it
[14]correctly.
[15]Q. I must --
[16]A. I thought you were asking me can you -- can
[17]I give you an example of things that do not cause
[18]non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
[19]Q. Let me ask again. I must have --
[20]A. Please do.
[21]Q. -- done a bad job.
[22]Can you give me an example of three
[23]substances that are generally accepted by
[24]oncologists to cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for
[25]which epidemiology exists and that epidemiology is
  Page 61
[1]negative, i.e., does not show a statistical
[2]significance?
[3]A. I do not understand the question.
[4]MR. LITZENBURG: You can ask him to
[5]rephrase if you don't understand.
[6]Are you talking about a single paper or an
[7]entire body of epidemiology?
[8]Q. The question is -- I'm asking for three
[9]substances that oncologists generally accept to be a
[10]cause of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the face of
[11]negative epidemiology.
[12]A. I don't think I'm qualified to answer this
[13]question. I have to do my research. I did not do
[14]research for that topic.
[15]Q. Okay.
[16]A. But more than happy to -- you intrigued me.
[17]I'll do some research on that.
[18]Q. You can't tell me any today anyway?
[19]A. I can't.
[20]Q. Do you -- when you were discussing IARC in
[21]your expert report, you mentioned that they
[22]performed a hazard assessment; is that right, sir?
[23]A. Is there a particular page you want me to
[24]look at?
[25]Q. Never mind. It's not a question about your
  Page 62
[1]expert --
[2]A. I have it, page 16, yeah.
[3]Q. Do you understand that the nature of the
[4]assessment that they did was a hazard assessment and
[5]not a risk assessment?
[6]A. I do.
[7]Q. Okay. And would you tell the jury what the
[8]difference is, please.
[9]A. Well, when you do a hazard assessment, you
[10]look at the particular compound -- to my knowledge,
[11]again -- and please recognize I'm not an
[12]epidemiologist. But, to my understanding, that --
[13]when you do a hazard assessment, you look at the
[14]particular hazard that you are actually
[15]investigating and you look at the, you know, animal
[16]studies and then you look at the epidemiologic
[17]evidence and try to come up with a conclusion based
[18]on the available evidence.
[19]When you do a risk type of an assessment,
[20]you actually have more of a prospective evaluation
[21]to -- that you can identify the risk easily. That's
[22]my understanding.
[23]Q. Okay. Have you -- have you heard it
[24]described this way, sir, that a hazard assessment is
[25]looking at the possibility for a substance to cause
  Page 63
[1]cancer, whether it is possible for a substance to
[2]cause cancer at any exposure at any level; whereas,
[3]a risk assessment assesses whether there is a
[4]genuine risk to human health from that substance at
[5]the levels at which humans will be exposed?
[6]A. I have not heard this definition. I
[7]apologize.
[8]Q. Okay, sir.
[9]Do you claim that glyphosate is a substance
[10]capable of causing cancer in humans?
[11]A. I looked at the evidence of non-Hodgkin
[12]lymphoma. I think when you say "cancer," it's a
[13]very general broad term.
[14]So are you asking the question cancer or
[15]non-Hodgkin lymphoma?
[16]Q. Let's -- let's ask about non-Hodgkin's
[17]lymphoma first.
[18]A. I do.
[19]Q. Do you have the opinion that it causes any
[20]other kind of cancer in humans?
[21]A. I did not research other kinds of cancer.
[22]Q. Now, do you also hold the opinion that
[23]glyphosate actually causes cancer in humans at the
[24]levels at which humans are exposed to it?
[25]A. I do. It's very difficult to -- to know
  Page 64
[1]exactly the levels, and so forth. It's very, very
[2]difficult. It's not like a pill that you take
[3]10 milligram here and 15 milligram here and you
[4]really know exactly the dose. So it's just -- by
[5]its nature, it's just very difficult to establish
[6]that.
[7]But the body of evidence suggests that the
[8]current exposure, whatever that exposure may be,
[9]appears to be causative of the development of
[10]non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
[11]Q. And you're talking about the epidemiology
[12]evidence?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. Anything else?
[15]A. We talked about the fact you cannot do
[16]really prospective randomization. You just can't do
[17]that.
[18]Q. Yes, sir.
[19]Of the other studies that you discussed in
[20]your expert report, are you relying on any other for
[21]the conclusion that glyphosate is capable of causing
[22]cancer in humans at the levels to which humans are
[23]exposed?
[24]A. I rely heavily on IARC. I think IARC is a
[25]world authority in making a decision, whether
  Page 65
[1]certain compounds and materials are associated or
[2]causative of developing cancer and malignancy or
[3]non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
[4]So I think it's very important to rely
[5]on -- on authority in the field. I mean, that's
[6]what IARC is.
[7]Q. Okay. Anything else?
[8]A. I think you see that in my expert report
[9]into what else I reported -- I relied on. I relied
[10]on some meta-analysis that were published in some
[11]epidemiologic studies. You have that.
[12]Q. Okay. So the meta-analyses, the
[13]epidemiologic studies, and IARC; is that right?
[14]A. That is correct.
[15]Q. Explain to me, sir, how it is that you
[16]relied on IARC, how that formed a -- something that
[17]you leaned on in your -- forming your opinion about
[18]this.
[19]A. I read the Lancet paper that was published.
[20]I think it was Guyton, the first author. I think
[21]it's '015. I read the IARC Monograph and the
[22]information that they provided, and that's how I
[23]relied on them.
[24]Q. And did you defer to the expertise of the
[25]epidemiologists and the toxicologists and the
  Page 66
[1]mechanism experts and the other experts who were not
[2]cancer -- cancer doctors --
[3]A. You mean the authors of the paper?
[4]Q. Yes, the authors of the paper.
[5]-- in their evaluations in forming your
[6]opinion?
[7]A. Well, you have to remember that, for a
[8]paper to get submitted and accepted in a journal
[9]like Lancet, it has gone through the utmost rigor of
[10]peer-review process. So, you know, these folks who
[11]authored this paper, the output and whatever they
[12]actually wrote has been reviewed by experts in the
[13]field in order for this to be accepted.
[14]And so I'll have to rely on this because it
[15]is not just an opinion piece that you actually
[16]write. You write the paper. You submit the
[17]evidence. And then it gets peer-reviewed by your
[18]own peers that they understand toxicology, they
[19]understand epidemiology, they understand all of
[20]these things. And then it's -- either get accepted
[21]or not accepted.
[22]So, clearly, the body of evidence was
[23]robust enough that it was accepted in a major
[24]journal like Lancet.
[25]Q. Okay. Sir, I'm talking about you and what
  Page 67
[1]you relied on.
[2]A. I --
[3]Q. Did you -- did you -- do you defer to the
[4]epidemiologists and the toxicologists who are
[5]involved with IARC for the opinions that they formed
[6]about glyphosate in reaching your opinions?
[7]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. Asked and
[8]answered.
[9]THE WITNESS: Do I answer?
[10]MR. LITZENBURG: You can answer if you have
[11]anything additional.
[12]A. As I said, I'm not going to re-peer review
[13]the actual paper. I take the paper. I take the
[14]output, and I form my opinion based on the evidence.
[15]But it is not my role to perform a peer-review
[16]process and ask for original material, and so forth.
[17]I have enough evidence based on that paper.
[18]So do I defer to them and their opinions?
[19]I respect their opinions. I may agree; I may not
[20]agree with everything that a particular toxicologist
[21]or epidemiologist say, but I certainly weighed
[22]heavily on the IARC output and the IARC paper
[23]because of who IARC is and because where it was
[24]published.
[25]This was not published in a throwaway
  Page 68
[1]journal. This was in one of the major journals.
[2]The impact factor is top. So clearly I respect the
[3]output, and I relied very heavily on the information
[4]that were provided.
[5]Q. In the absence of the IARC report, if that
[6]had not existed and the Lancet article had not
[7]existed, would you have reached the same conclusion?
[8]A. I would have to reach my own conclusion
[9]based on the epidemiologic evidence. So it was very
[10]nice to see that my own opinion was solidified with
[11]a major organization like the IARC. So I think, you
[12]know, you have to take it both together.
[13]I can't really answer what I would have
[14]concluded had the IARC not available. That's
[15]complete speculation for me. I don't know what I
[16]would have done. IARC was part of the literature
[17]that I reviewed. So if I take the IARC away, then
[18]I'll have to go back to a different mindset and
[19]re-review everything, and I can't answer that. It's
[20]not a fair question to me.
[21]Q. So you might have come to a different
[22]conclusion?
[23]A. I didn't say that. I said I can't answer
[24]that.
[25]Q. You don't know --
  Page 69
[1]A. I don't know what my conclusion is. I
[2]mean, you're just taking away a paper, and say what
[3]would your conclusion be if you take away this
[4]paper. How do -- how am I supposed to answer that?
[5]I don't know.
[6]I know my opinion based on the current
[7]papers I reviewed. If you take piece of the papers
[8]I reviewed, then I'll have to re-review everything
[9]and decide whether I come to the same conclusion,
[10]different conclusion, the same conclusion.
[11]But you -- you can't just take away part of
[12]the evidence I relied on and say, what would you
[13]have concluded, because that's then a completely
[14]different case.
[15]Q. Yes. You'd have to go do the work over to
[16]know what you would come up with; right?
[17]A. Exactly.
[18]Q. The -- you know that the EPA has concluded
[19]on multiple occasions that glyphosate is not a
[20]carcinogen; correct?
[21]A. I have seen some of these reports, yes.
[22]Q. And you disagree with the EPA on that;
[23]correct?
[24]A. I think the IARC report is more convincing
[25]than the EPA conclusion, and it's more substantial.
  Page 70
[1]Q. Why?
[2]A. Because of, you know, again, the EPA report
[3]is not something that is submitted to a
[4]peer-reviewed journal where it really gets the rigor
[5]of other peers looking at things and evaluating
[6]things. It's an -- it's almost an opinion piece
[7]where folks who -- that, you know, sit on the EPA,
[8]they come up with an opinion, and they publish that
[9]opinion. Nobody is really looking at and critiquing
[10]it.
[11]At the same time, there are certain
[12]methodological things that I read into how the EPA
[13]came to some of their conclusions that did not
[14]really follow the guidelines that they should have
[15]followed. There are a lot of critique from my
[16]reading into the methodology that they actually used
[17]was not as clean as the IARC methodology.
[18]Q. Critiques written by whom?
[19]A. I mean, just go on the web and research
[20]EPA. It's like -- I mean, public information.
[21]Q. These are critiques that were written by
[22]people like Chris Portier, who is one of the members
[23]of the IARC, generating criticisms of EPA and others
[24]after the fact in the press; right?
[25]A. I have read some of his, and I -- I mean,
  Page 71
[1]again, I think -- I think, if you have a solid -- in
[2]my opinion, if there are certain opinions and there
[3]are certain evidence-based facts, then submit them
[4]to the rigor of the peer-review process and let's
[5]see if they withstand the peer-review process where
[6]we can actually get them out in public.
[7]So I'm a strong believer in evidence-based
[8]and a strong believer in the peer-review process
[9]and -- because it's very rigorous.
[10]Q. You say in your expert report, sir, on
[11]page 17 -- this is a section where you are talking
[12]about IARC; correct?
[13]A. I see that, yes. Excuse me.
[14]Q. I'm on page 17, about two-thirds of the way
[15]down the page.
[16]A. Okay.
[17]Q. You said, IARC -- "IARC report was
[18]conceived in 2015 after an in-person meeting took
[19]place between 17 experts in the field from 11
[20]countries." Correct?
[21]A. Uh-hum.
[22]Q. And you say this meeting took place after a
[23]three-months period of reviewing the literature and
[24]analyzing all available data and evidence; correct?
[25]A. I do, yeah.
  Page 72
[1]Q. Where did you get the information that
[2]there was a three-month period of reviewing the
[3]literature and that all available data and evidence
[4]was reviewed?
[5]A. I forgot. I don't remember where I got
[6]this. It's probably from the paper by Guyton,
[7]et. al, in Lancet or by some of the editorials. I
[8]do know these are facts. I looked it up at the
[9]time.
[10]Q. Do you know that Dr. Aaron Blair, who was
[11]the head of the group, was deposed -- had his
[12]deposition taken?
[13]A. I do know he was deposed. I never read his
[14]deposition.
[15]Q. Do you know that he testified that the IARC
[16]working group spent only one or two days total
[17]assessing whether glyphosate could cause cancer?
[18]A. I did not know that.
[19]Q. Do you know that he testified that they
[20]didn't really start work on any of the analysis
[21]until they arrived in Lyon, France?
[22]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to the
[23]characterization.
[24]A. I did not know that. Did not know.
[25]Q. Okay. Does that alter your opinion about
  Page 73
[1]the rigor of the IARC review?
[2]A. No, it does not.
[3]Q. Why not?
[4]A. Because you could do a lot of the research
[5]before you come to Lyon, France. I mean, I have
[6]been there on committees where you -- you know, the
[7]actual two-day meeting is to discuss what you have
[8]been researching for the past few months as a
[9]committee. And then you come in and you debate what
[10]you actually did.
[11]So the -- whether you spent two hours or
[12]two days during the actual meeting does not mean
[13]that you did not spend months or weeks before
[14]researching the subject. This is the -- you're not
[15]going to meet for three months over certain things,
[16]or four months. You do the research beforehand, and
[17]you say, okay, in March or April we're going to
[18]meet; and whatever you've researched, we're going to
[19]discuss and come up where a report. It happens all
[20]the time.
[21]Q. Sir --
[22]A. The WHO for lymphoma, for example, the
[23]publication that we just went over, the types of
[24]lymphoma. This was a one-day meeting, and it was
[25]published. It doesn't mean that the research was
  Page 74
[1]just one day. It was a year in the making and
[2]debates, and so forth. And then you get together in
[3]a particular time and you come up and generate an
[4]output. So it doesn't alter my opinion.
[5]Q. Do you know if there is testimony in this
[6]litigation, sir, that the IARC working group was
[7]provided with data from Greim, et al., the Greim
[8]paper involving 14 animal cancer bioassays on
[9]glyphosate that in the published literature and did
[10]not review it?
[11]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. He said he
[12]hadn't read the Blair testimony.
[13]A. I did not know that. I did not see the
[14]testimony.
[15]Q. You mentioned the Greim paper in your
[16]expert report; correct, sir? You mention it on
[17]page 16.
[18]A. One second. Yep.
[19]Q. And this is at the bottom of a paragraph
[20]that's discussing a meta-analysis by Chang and
[21]Delzell?
[22]A. Uh-hum.
[23]Q. And at the end of the discussion of the
[24]Chang and Delzell meta-analysis, you say, "Notably
[25]no increased risk for Hodgkin's lymphoma was found
  Page 75
[1]in this study." And then you said, "To the
[2]contrary, Greim, et al., suggested lack of
[3]association, "Critical Reviews of Toxicology,"
[4]2015."
[5]And you understood, sir, that the Greim
[6]paper was a review of animal cancer bioassays,
[7]right, not a meta-analysis?
[8]A. I really have to relook at the paper.
[9]It's -- I mean, I'm more than happy to relook at it.
[10]I do remember looking at it at the time, but it's --
[11]I want to make sure I provide you with the accurate
[12]answer.
[13]Q. Yes, sir.
[14](Nabhan Exhibit 5 marked for
[15]identification.)
[16]Q. So Exhibit 5 is a review article from the
[17]Critical Reviews in Toxicology by Greim, et al.,
[18]entitled "Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of
[19]the herbicide glyphosate drawing on tumor incidence
[20]data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent
[21]studies."
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I see that, yes.
[24]Q. And did you read this?
[25]A. A while back. But I'm trying to refresh my
  Page 76
[1]memory. If you are going to ask me questions in
[2]particular to this study, I'm -- I would like some
[3]time just to review it and make sure I provide you
[4]the accurate answers. If you're not going to ask me
[5]about it, then I don't have to waste time.
[6]Q. Well, let's see.
[7]A. Sure.
[8]Q. First of all, I want to know if you
[9]reviewed it.
[10]A. Yes, a while back I did.
[11]Q. And did you consider the contents of this
[12]review article informing your conclusion about
[13]glyphosate?
[14]A. Well, of course. I mean, I wouldn't really
[15]mention it -- I mean, you know, I wouldn't mention
[16]it in my report if it's not something that I did not
[17]consider it.
[18]I did, obviously, pause, given the fact
[19]that one of the coauthors is employed by the company
[20]that makes the drug, the compound. So to me, as a
[21]researcher, I'll always have to pause about this and
[22]see how -- how fair and balanced and no bias was in
[23]a paper like this.
[24]Q. What you wrote in your expert report is "To
[25]the contrary, Greim, et al., suggested lack of
  Page 77
[1]association; however, one of the coauthors of this
[2]work was employed by Monsanto and provided
[3]ghostwriting, making my question the credibility of
[4]this work."
[5]Correct?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. That's the only thing you say about Greim
[8]in your whole expert report?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. Right?
[11]And nowhere in your expert report do you
[12]assess the actual content of this article; right?
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[14]A. Well, I read the paper. And, again, I
[15]bring it up here because the conclusion or the
[16]output of that paper suggests lack of association.
[17]And I mentioned why the credibility of the paper was
[18]of low value to me as a clinician, as a researcher,
[19]because I'll have to wonder whether it was really
[20]fair and balanced.
[21]It's a fair thing for me to question the
[22]evidence based on the authors. We do that all the
[23]time.
[24]Q. How did you form the opinion that one of
[25]the authors was involved in ghostwriting?
  Page 78
[1]A. Well, two things. The -- if you look at
[2]David Saltmiras --
[3]Q. Yes, sir.
[4]A. -- affiliation is Monsanto and glyphosate
[5]task force. And I think I'm trying to remember
[6]where I read that it is possible that he had a lot
[7]of contribute -- I mean, he's a coauthor; so he, you
[8]know, again, as a coauthor of the -- whether you
[9]call this ghostwriting or not ghostwriting, I mean,
[10]but he's a coauthor that's employed by the company
[11]that makes glyphosate.
[12]So I guess, you know, I mean, you'll have
[13]to wonder whether the opinions in the paper were
[14]fair and balanced and free of bias.
[15]Q. Did you discount the opinions expressed in
[16]the paper on the grounds that one of the authors was
[17]employed by Monsanto?
[18]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. Asked and
[19]answered.
[20]A. It made me question the conclusion. I
[21]think if you were me, you would probably have the
[22]same question.
[23]Again, you know, how likely is an employee
[24]of the company that makes a compound is going to go
[25]on the record in a peer review and say "The compound
  Page 79
[1]of the company that employs me causes cancer"? I
[2]mean, it's probably almost going to be zero, the
[3]chances are, or be fired.
[4]So I think for me, you know, great. It's
[5]good paper, I guess. But, I mean, I'll have to put
[6]my clinician-researcher critical hat and say, I'll
[7]take this with a grain of salt, whatever the output
[8]is. It's very difficult for me now to assess
[9]objectively the literature because I know what the
[10]conclusion will be. I mean, I know the conclusion
[11]will be that there is no association; otherwise, an
[12]employee of the company will not be a coauthor.
[13]Q. Sir, this is not original research; right?
[14]It's a -- it's a --
[15]A. Whatever research.
[16]Q. -- summary --
[17]A. Whatever it is.
[18]Q. It's a summary of 14 animal studies;
[19]correct?
[20]A. Yeah. But you asked me whether I
[21]discounted the output of the research based on the
[22]coauthor, and I said it made me look at with a high
[23]degree of skepticism. Because it's only fair, if I
[24]already looked at the authors before I even read
[25]anything, I knew what the conclusion will be. So
  Page 80
[1]then -- then if I already knew the conclusion,
[2]nothing was shocking there. You know, it's already
[3]clear where the paper will be heading.
[4]Q. Sir?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. I asked a simpler question than that.
[7]This is not original research; it is a
[8]summary of 14 animal studies. Correct?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. The data tables from those 14 animal that
[11]are summarized herein were available and remain
[12]available online for review; correct?
[13]A. Which table are you looking at?
[14]Q. All of the data tables from which the
[15]information in this -- come.
[16]A. There's Table 1 and there's Table 2.
[17]Q. I'm talking about an online annex.
[18]A. Where is the online annex? I'm not sure.
[19]Q. Online, sir.
[20]A. Okay. Well, I'll have -- are you going to
[21]show me that?
[22]Q. Do you see at the back of the paper,
[23]"Supplemental material available online, data
[24]supplementary study 1-14"? The data is all
[25]available online; right?
  Page 81
[1]A. Right. If you want me to comment on this
[2]data, I need to see it.
[3]Q. Did you look?
[4]A. On the -- on the supplementary data?
[5]Q. Yes, sir.
[6]A. I don't remember if I did.
[7]Q. Do you know if any statement in the Greim
[8]article is false or misrepresents in any way the
[9]original data that is available online for you to
[10]review?
[11]A. My opinion was formed based on the fact
[12]that one of the coauthors is employed by the
[13]company. So I question the evidence.
[14]Q. You question the accuracy of the data that
[15]is published online?
[16]A. I do.
[17]Q. You question whether it's fraudulently
[18]misrepresented?
[19]A. I didn't say that.
[20]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[21]A. I said -- I didn't say it's fraudulent.
[22]I'm not making any accusations. I said I have an
[23]author on a paper that's employed by a company that
[24]is making the compound in question. I think any
[25]fair clinician and researcher -- you can ask a
  Page 82
[1]hundred of them -- will put the skepticism hat and
[2]say, Well, you know, I don't know. I need to -- you
[3]know, I'll have to take a look at this more
[4]carefully, and so forth.
[5]Q. Did you?
[6]A. I don't remember if I looked at the
[7]supplementary data.
[8]Q. Okay.
[9]A. Like I said, I read this paper, and the
[10]output of this paper became questionable to me
[11]because I knew what the conclusion will be even
[12]before I read the paper based on who the authors
[13]were.
[14]Q. You just told us -- sir, you just told the
[15]jury that you would doubt the accuracy of the data,
[16]the original data --
[17]A. The conclusion.
[18]Q. -- from the studies.
[19]A. The conclusion of the paper.
[20]Q. Okay. Do you doubt the data?
[21]A. I will need to relook at the data more
[22]critically and assure that there is transparency and
[23]everything is actually being provided and given.
[24]And I'm not the animal toxicologist to actually give
[25]that, so this data should be, you know, given to
  Page 83
[1]whoever reviewed or whoever is involved.
[2]I'm not an animal toxicologist to provide
[3]an opinion. But if that data is available, then
[4]should be critically assessed and evaluated by
[5]others who are experts in the field. I'm just
[6]giving you my opinion as a reviewer of something
[7]that I saw in the literature that is written,
[8]technically, by the company that makes the compound.
[9]I mean, wouldn't it be fair for me to question that?
[10]Q. You gave it no weight because of the
[11]authorship. Is that fair to say?
[12]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[13]A. I actually said -- I said in my report that
[14]makes me question the credibility of this work.
[15]Q. How much weight did you give it?
[16]A. I --
[17]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[18]A. I looked at the entire -- at everything. I
[19]didn't weigh every study. It's not what a clinician
[20]does. It's not like I take one study and I give it
[21]zero weight and another study ten. It's not a point
[22]system. You review the literature, and then you
[23]come up with a conclusion based on everything. It's
[24]not a weight system for each study.
[25]You know, then you have meta-analysis.
  Page 84
[1]Then you go and rely on a couple of meta-analyses.
[2]And the meta-analyses, they go in and they try to
[3]take a look at all of the studies that were going
[4]on. So they've done some of the work for me. And
[5]there were two meta-analyses that showed --
[6]showed -- again, and I referenced in my expert
[7]report, showed an odds ratio and risk ratio that is
[8]in terms of causation and association.
[9]So I didn't do a point system for every
[10]single study. It's just not how I reviewed things.
[11]Q. Yes, sir.
[12]When you say that the meta-analysis did
[13]some of your work for you, what do you mean by that?
[14]A. I said a lot of times, when you have so
[15]many studies going on, a meta-analysis is a way of
[16]trying to lump the evidence into, you know,
[17]comprehensively assess all of these studies and try
[18]to come up with a conclusion that is either a yea or
[19]a nay in terms of an association or a causation.
[20]And the two meta-analyses that I saw were
[21]referenced on -- on page 15. One is by Schinasi and
[22]León and the other one by another authors. The
[23]other one is by Chang and Delzell.
[24]Q. And in what way did that do some of your
[25]work for you?
  Page 85
[1]A. What I mean by doing some work for me is
[2]the meta-analysis in general, there's a methodology
[3]for meta-analysis. To conduct a meta-analysis in a
[4]systemic review, there's an actual methodology where
[5]they look at all of the studies collectively. So
[6]whatever the authors are, they looked at the
[7]complete body of evidence and literature, and they
[8]came up with these conclusions.
[9]So I didn't do my own meta-analysis.
[10]That's what I'm trying to say.
[11]Q. Had the meta-analyses yielded a
[12]non-statistically significant result, how would that
[13]affect your opinion?
[14]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[15]A. Yeah, I mean, I think -- I think, again, it
[16]is -- I'll say this, and I think I said that a
[17]couple times before: It is really important to not
[18]rely on one study or another. It is impossible in
[19]epidemiology and occupational exposure literature.
[20]You'll have to rely on all of the evidence.
[21]And, again, I think you've asked me the
[22]question if the IARC was not there, what was your
[23]conclusion -- what could have been your conclusion?
[24]Which is a complete speculation. The same answer is
[25]here.
  Page 86
[1]I mean, I don't know, if the meta-analyses
[2]were negative, what type of report I would come up
[3]with or what type of conclusion I would come up
[4]with. It's just a completely different review. I
[5]don't know the answer to that.
[6]Q. Well, you've said that -- we've established
[7]earlier that you primarily were focused on the
[8]epidemiology in conducting your analysis here, and
[9]you just said that a meta-analysis is a review of
[10]all the available epidemiology --
[11]A. Is an attempt -- is an attempt to lump a
[12]lot of the studies that were peer-reviewed and
[13]published in the literature to come up with a
[14]conclusion.
[15]Q. Yes, sir.
[16]A. And I have done some meta-analysis while
[17]looked at a particular compound, you know. I mean,
[18]you just -- sometimes you just want to try to come
[19]in the totality of evidence.
[20]Q. And when you look at the totality of the
[21]evidence through the tools of meta-analysis and
[22]those results turn out to be not statistically
[23]significant, what does that mean to your -- to you
[24]as someone who is trying to do a causality analysis?
[25]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
  Page 87
[1]A. Yeah. I will have to understand the
[2]methodology of the meta-analysis, how was it done?
[3]Did they have individual data? Did they have
[4]patient-level data? What have they done to come up
[5]to this conclusion? I think it's very important
[6]to -- to look at what was done.
[7]Q. You can't say what effect it would have on
[8]your opinion if the meta-analyses --
[9]A. Of course not.
[10]Q. -- not statistically significant?
[11]A. I just don't know.
[12]Q. Yes, sir.
[13]On the subject of the Greim study being
[14]ghostwritten, as you say, it is transparent on the
[15]face of this published study that one of the
[16]coauthors is a Monsanto employee; correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. You didn't need to hear from anybody else
[19]to know that; it says it right at the top?
[20]A. No.
[21]Q. And it says it right at the bottom, "To
[22]address for correspondence David Saltmiras, Monsanto
[23]Company." Right?
[24]A. Good. Yeah.
[25]Q. So that was very --
  Page 88
[1]A. Which is a little bit unusual.
[2]Q. -- clearly --
[3]A. Which is a little bit unusual, because most
[4]often, if you look at most papers, the corresponding
[5]author is either the first or the last author.
[6]Always. And I've been last author and first author
[7]on over 200 papers. It's very unusual for the
[8]corresponding author to be the second author and the
[9]employee.
[10]Q. Is that a sinister thing?
[11]A. It is -- I would say this happens in less
[12]than 1 percent. So why?
[13]Q. Is it a sinister thing?
[14]A. It's unusual. Why?
[15]Q. Is it sinister?
[16]A. What do you mean by "sinister"? Define
[17]"sinister" to me. It's something that is not
[18]common --
[19]Q. Why are you flagging this as an important
[20]thing?
[21]A. Well, why -- why is it a deviation from
[22]what we've always written pages? If we've always
[23]had the corresponding author as the first and the
[24]last author, why all the sudden I have a second
[25]author who's an employee as the corresponding
  Page 89
[1]author?
[2]You have -- I think the burden of proof is
[3]on the authors to explain to me why. So I don't
[4]know why. I mean, I've never been a second author
[5]as a corresponding author.
[6]The first and last author in medical
[7]literature are always the corresponding authors. In
[8]fact, there are fights. People fight who's going to
[9]the first and last author so they can get the
[10]corresponding author. Because it's an honorary
[11]thing to be a corresponding author.
[12]So to me, again, you just have to -- you'll
[13]have to explain to me why is a second author, who is
[14]not the original researcher, who is an employee, is
[15]the corresponding author?
[16]Q. What I want you to explain to me, sir, is
[17]why you say that Dr. Saltmiras ghostwrote a paper
[18]that he is a listed author on where his
[19]institutional affiliation is clearly disclosed?
[20]A. Yeah. I think I may have, you know -- the
[21]term "ghostwriting" here was -- is not what I meant
[22]by ghostwriting that he is not there. I meant that
[23]he provided writing. You're right. Ghostwriting
[24]means that you don't even put your name, if
[25]that's -- you know, I didn't imply that ghostwriting
  Page 90
[1]means that he was not a coauthor. I meant that he
[2]probably was the most responsible author of the
[3]entire manuscript. I mean, he is the employee; he's
[4]the correspondence author; he provided all the data.
[5]Q. So ghostwriting --
[6]A. A very good question.
[7]Q. I'm sorry. Were you done?
[8]A. What I meant by "ghostwriting" is that
[9]cowrote or was an author on that paper.
[10]Q. "Ghostwriting" really isn't the right word
[11]for the situation presented by the Greim article; is
[12]that right?
[13]A. You're correct.
[14]MR. LITZENBURG: If we are done with Greim,
[15]we've been going about an hour and a half. Can
[16]we take a break?
[17]MR. GRIFFIS: Sure.
[18]VIDEOGRAPHER: Ending Disc No. 1 of the

  Page 91
[1]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[2]Q. Sir, do you understand what it is that is
[3]contained in the Greim article, what these animal
[4]studies are?
[5]A. I did not look into each particular study
[6]by itself.
[7]Q. And do you know that this is the main body
[8]of regulatory evidence that was reviewed by the EPA
[9]and by European and other regulators in approving
[10]glyphosate as safe and effective for sale in the
[11]United States?
[12]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[13]A. I did not know that this is the sole
[14]evidence or the most important evidence that was
[15]reviewed by the EPA.
[16]Q. And, I'm sorry. With regard to the issue
[17]of carcinogenicity. Did you know that?
[18]A. I did not know that.
[19]Q. And do you know that in addition to these
[20]14 rodent studies, studies done in mice and rats
[21]that formed the basis for the conclusions by EPA and
[22]by foreign regulators that glyphosate was not a
[23]threat for human cancer, there were additional
[24]animal studies done by other registrants, other
[25]people choosing to sell generic forms of glyphosate
  Page 92
[1]that were also considered by EPA and by foreign
[2]regulators?
[3]A. I did not know that.
[4]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[5]Q. And do you know that EPA and foreign
[6]regulators consider long-term cancer bioassays, like
[7]the 14 described herein, critical in assessing
[8]whether a substance that's been submitted for
[9]registration review is carcinogenic?
[10]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection.
[11]A. I have not been a part of the EPA review
[12]panel or decision maker for the EPA, so I don't know
[13]what their process is.
[14]Q. And you know that IARC did not review this
[15]data in any form; correct?
[16]A. I don't know if the IARC reviewed this
[17]particular data. What I know is that the IARC
[18]concluded that there's sufficient evidence based on
[19]animal studies that there is carcinogenicity.
[20]Q. You know that IARC has a policy of not
[21]reviewing anything unpublished; correct?
[22]A. I think it's fair to review only published
[23]data.
[24]Q. And you know that none of this data was
[25]published except in the form of this article;
  Page 93
[1]correct?
[2]A. Again, I'll go back and say that my
[3]understanding from my review that the IARC saw
[4]sufficient evidence on animal studies that they
[5]reviewed that there's carcinogenicity. Whether they
[6]reviewed this particular paper or not, I don't know,
[7]but I know that their review collectively
[8]demonstrated that the animal studies that they
[9]looked at had sufficient evidence to establish
[10]carcinogenicity.
[11]Q. And you know that it's IARC's policy not to
[12]review unpublished studies regardless of their
[13]quality; correct?
[14]A. I think if there are studies of good
[15]quality, they should be published. So if they're
[16]not published, then why should they be reviewed?
[17]Q. Do you know that registration studies --
[18]and that's the term for studies that are performed
[19]by companies in order to secure registration -- are
[20]considered their intellectual property and that, if
[21]they were published in their entirety, then another
[22]registrant could just submit them to the EPA and get
[23]a generic form of glyphosate registered thereby?
[24]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[25]A. In my life and in -- as a
  Page 94
[1]clinician-researcher, pretty much almost all
[2]registration studies for cancer therapies have to be
[3]published in peer-reviewed journals. So I'm not
[4]sure if there's a different thing for compounds like
[5]this, but pretty much every drug that has been
[6]approved for the treatment of cancer through
[7]registration trial has been published in a
[8]peer-reviewed journal.
[9]Q. Okay. And that's not the case for --
[10]A. These are registration --
[11]Q. -- for herbicides. Did you know that?
[12]A. I did not -- like I said, I did not -- I
[13]don't know the actual process of the -- of
[14]herbicides with the EPA, and so forth.
[15]But, in my opinion, if there is literature
[16]that is sufficient and compelling, then it should be
[17]subject to a peer-review process and the rigor of
[18]peer review and get published. There is no reason
[19]not to get published.
[20]Q. Having gone through the rigor of peer
[21]review and publication and having been published,
[22]this should have been reviewed by IARC; right?
[23]A. I think -- yeah, I mean, I think this is
[24]peer-reviewed paper. So it may have been, may have
[25]not been reviewed by IARC. I don't know.
  Page 95
[1]But what I'm saying is that the collective
[2]evidence from IARC or the output from IARC suggested
[3]that the animal studies that they looked at
[4]established carcinogenicity collectively. I don't
[5]know if this particular paper that you're
[6]referencing was reviewed by IARC.
[7]Q. And this particular paper constituting a
[8]report on data from the 14 key registration studies
[9]considered to be pivotal and critical by the EPA is
[10]certainly the sort of thing that IARC should
[11]consider?
[12]A. I can't speak for the --
[13]Q. You would agree?
[14]A. I cannot speak for the IARC. I mean, I
[15]think -- I don't represent the IARC.
[16]Q. No, sir. You're someone who -- you're
[17]someone who has said you are relying --
[18]A. I do rely on them.
[19]Q. -- on the conclusions of IARC and rejecting
[20]the conclusions of the EPA. So what I'm exploring
[21]right now is the difference in what they
[22]considered --
[23]A. Right.
[24]Q. -- in reaching those conclusions.
[25]A. I'm not in a position to evaluate their
  Page 96
[1]process or critique their process. I'm in the
[2]position to either believe or disbelieve the output.
[3]The actual process that they go by, that is
[4]something you have to take on with IARC.
[5]Q. And there is testimony in this litigation,
[6]sir -- are you aware of this -- that testimony,
[7]uncontradicted testimony -- that this study, the
[8]Greim study, was available to them in their hands
[9]and they did not consider it?
[10]A. I have not --
[11]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection.
[12]A. -- seen this testimony but more than happy
[13]to look at it.
[14]Q. Would that cause you any concern?
[15]A. I'll need to see the testimony.
[16]Q. Would it cause you any concern if this was
[17]in their hands and they chose not to review it?
[18]A. I will need to under -- A, I need to look
[19]at the testimony; B, I need to know why they didn't
[20]look at it. They may have had a very good reason or
[21]a valid reason, and I don't know that.
[22]But that is something to ask the IARC. I
[23]mean, if they -- if they had a paper and they chose
[24]not to review it, then the IARC must have a reason.
[25]And I don't know what that reason may be.
  Page 97
[1]I'm not aware of the testimony, but it's
[2]the IARC's decision to look at the literature. I
[3]can't really speak for them, but I think it's a
[4]valid question to ask them why was it -- why -- why
[5]was this not considered. And let's see what they
[6]say.
[7]Q. You're relying on the animal study
[8]conclusions of IARC, a group that did not look at
[9]the key studies that all regulatory agencies
[10]consider in assessing the carcinogenicity of a
[11]substance, and you are rejecting the opinions of EPA
[12]and the British authorities and the Canadian
[13]authorities and the German authorities and the
[14]European Union authorities who did look at this very
[15]same data --
[16]A. Well, the IARC --
[17]Q. -- is that correct?
[18]A. The IARC, in my opinion, is the most
[19]authoritative agency to look at causation between
[20]compounds and cancer. That is my opinion. And what
[21]they review and why they reviewed some things or not
[22]reviewed some thing, that is something that the IARC
[23]has to decide based on their processes and
[24]procedures and their SOPs. I don't know what
[25]studies they decide to look at versus not.
  Page 98
[1]Q. Tell --
[2]A. What I know is I look at the output of it
[3]and then review my own data and try to come up with
[4]a conclusion.
[5]Q. Why do you consider IARC to be more
[6]authoritative than the EPA on the subject of the
[7]safety of an herbicide?
[8]A. I think that's well known. The IARC is a
[9]subset of the -- I think the acronym is the
[10]International Agency for Research and -- on Cancer.
[11]And I think, you know, pretty much this
[12]is -- in my mind, this is the authority that looks
[13]at these things. It's not me considering this. I
[14]think there are a lot of folks in the field that
[15]consider the IARC as the most authoritative agency.
[16]Q. Do you know how --
[17]A. This is not my own opinion.
[18]Q. Do you know how substances IARC has looked
[19]at in the past as to whether they are
[20]carcinogenic --
[21]A. I don't know that.
[22]Q. -- and concluded that it is not?
[23]A. Don't know.
[24]Q. You don't know how many they've found not
[25]to be carcinogenic?
  Page 99
[1]A. Why should I know? I don't know. It's
[2]not -- I mean, this is not something within scope of
[3]what I was asked to look at.
[4]Q. You don't know that as an ep- -- as an
[5]oncologist?
[6]A. I do not.
[7]Q. Now, the IARC broke up into subgroups for
[8]its review. You understand that?
[9]A. I do.
[10]Q. And one of the subgroups looked at the
[11]epidemiologic evidence; correct?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. And it found that evidence to be limited;
[14]right?
[15]A. Do you have the Guyton paper with you? I
[16]mean, again, I want to --
[17]Q. I have the Monograph.
[18]A. Well, the major one, I think, that -- I
[19]know that they broke into groups and each group
[20]looked at the particular evidence and so forth. So
[21]I -- I want to make sure I answer accurately.
[22]Or the Monograph, whatever it is.
[23]Thank you.
[24](Nabhan Exhibit 6 marked for
[25]identification.)
  Page 100
[1]Q. Exhibit 6, I've marked as the IARC
[2]Monograph, sir.
[3]A. Okay. Go ahead.
[4]Q. Okay. So the working group that focused on
[5]the epidemiologic evidence concluded that there was,
[6]quote, limited evidence --
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. -- that -- in humans -- limited evidence in
[9]humans, right, referring to the epidemiology
[10]evidence?
[11]A. Do you mind showing me which -- which part
[12]of the --
[13]Q. Yes, sir. Page 78.
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. The Evaluation section, 6.1, Cancer in
[16]Humans.
[17]A. Okay. I see that.
[18]Q. It says, "There is limited evidence in
[19]humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate." And
[20]then the specific cancer that they're talking about,
[21]they say, "A positive association has been observed
[22]for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma." Right?
[23]A. I see that, yeah.
[24]Q. Okay. Now, do you know the meaning of
[25]"limited evidence --"
  Page 101
[1]A. That you cannot be --
[2]Q. -- to IARC?
[3]A. -- you cannot be 100 percent certain. The
[4]only way to be 100 percent certain, as we talked
[5]about that earlier, it's a randomized controlled
[6]study. That is literally the only absolute way to
[7]be 100 percent sure. It is unethical or impossible
[8]to do.
[9]Q. And you know that IARC, when they say
[10]"limited evidence," they mean something much
[11]different than just not ruled out beyond any chance,
[12]like you were saying?
[13]A. Well, "limited evidence" means that the
[14]evidence is not -- is not certain, is not
[15]100 percent.
[16]Q. They mean something much less than that,
[17]sir. They mean -- I'll quote, "A positive
[18]association has been observed between exposure and
[19]the outcome for which a causal interpretation is
[20]credible but chance, bias, or confounding could not
[21]be ruled out with reasonable confidence."
[22]Do you understand that that's what IARC
[23]means when they say "limited evidence"?
[24]A. Now I do.
[25]Q. Do you agree with that?
   s e
   t s
   c
   rul t easonable m ?
[2]
  Page 102
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. So you agree that the epidemiology evidence
[3]with regard to glyphosate and NHL is credible but
[4]chance, bias, or confounding cannot be ruled out
[5]without reasonable confidence; is that right?
[6]A. If this is what the IARC said, then I do
[7]agree with that.
[8]Q. And with regard to any cancer other than
[9]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they didn't even find
[10]limited evidence; right? They found no evidence?
[11]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. Beyond the
[12]scope.
[13]A. Again, I -- I -- I did not really evaluate
[14]what evidence they looked at outside. I mean, I
[15]looked at the non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
[16]Q. Okay. You're not giving the opinion that
[17]glyphosate is associated with any cancer other than
[18]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; right?
[19]A. I'm just talking about non-Hodgkin
[20]lymphoma, correct.
[21]Q. And when you say that glyphosate is
[22]associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, do you say
[23]that it is also associated with every single subtype
[24]of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[25]A. Yeah, I think it's -- it's -- it's very
  Page 103
[1]difficult to establish that because of how many
[2]types of lymphomas there are and also because the
[3]understanding of the current classification of
[4]lymphoma was not the same classification that we had
[5]in the mid or late '90s, et cetera. So what we knew
[6]back in the '90s about the types of lymphoma is not
[7]what we know today.
[8]So I think you'll have to look at
[9]non-Hodgkin lymphoma as one entity when you look at
[10]this causation and association.
[11]Q. And you -- you're saying that we're forced
[12]to look at non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as one entity
[13]because we don't have much data on how glyphosate
[14]might be associated or not associated with various
[15]sub types?
[16]A. No, for various reasons, I think. A, the
[17]classification of lymphomas was different back then
[18]versus now. I mean, even -- just to give you an
[19]idea, the -- the 2016 classification, the earlier
[20]one was '014, then was '07, and there was 1999. So,
[21]again, it changes.
[22]Number 2, once you actually start looking
[23]at every single subtypes, the numbers become too
[24]small to actually be able to detect statistical
[25]significance. So when we look at causation in
  Page 104
[1]association with occupational exposures, you'll have
[2]to look at the actual entity as a whole in order for
[3]you to establish this such association.
[4]It's just by default. It's very difficult
[5]in lymphoma because you can't have a study for 60
[6]types.
[7]Q. Yes, sir.
[8]You are saying that, because of the
[9]inadequacy of the scientific data and because of our
[10]inability to distinguish between subtypes, we can
[11]only form a conclusion about non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[12]as a whole; is that fair?
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection.
[14]Mischaracterization.
[15]A. Well, I didn't say inadequacy of the
[16]scientific data. What I said is that lymphoma
[17]classification has changed over the past 20 years.
[18]So today I have 60 types. 20 years ago, I
[19]had probably 10 types or 20 types. So it's very
[20]difficult to look at each subtype because these
[21]types and subtypes have been refined and changed in
[22]classification. That's one reason.
[23]Q. Yes, sir.
[24]A. The number-two reason is, because of the
[25]number of subtypes for lymphomas, if you want to
  Page 105
[1]look at each one by itself, it becomes very
[2]difficult in terms of statistical or clinical
[3]significance.
[4]Q. Yes, sir.
[5]A. And the third reason is, because many of
[6]these studies that are case-controlled that you're
[7]asking the cases to recall what type of lymphomas
[8]they had, there are many patients or many folks,
[9]they don't really understand the granularity of the
[10]type of lymphomas.
[11]So you ask -- you know, a patient of mine,
[12]they say, "I have lymphoma." They may not even know
[13]it's non-Hodgkin versus Hodgkin, if it's follicular
[14]or it's large cell. So I think it's just -- it's
[15]not something you can actually logistically do
[16]accurately.
[17]Q. We don't have the information --
[18]A. Or the ability.
[19]Q. -- to distinguish between what association
[20]glyphosate may have or may not have with each
[21]subtype?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. And so the only conclusion that we can
[24]reach is about non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a whole and
[25]not about specific subtypes; is that fair?
   ?
   .
  Page 106
[1]A. Yes. But that doesn't take away that it --
[2]it is associated with all other subtypes. What I'm
[3]trying to say is, just because I don't have
[4]information for each subtype, it doesn't mean that
[5]it cannot be associated with it. When you are --
[6]Q. Yes, sir.
[7]A. When you have -- when you have an
[8]association or a causation between a compound and a
[9]disease, you could be causing all of the subtypes of
[10]that disease as well. You don't really need to
[11]study each subtype.
[12]We know the association of tobacco and lung
[13]cancer. We don't need to establish this for the six
[14]subtypes of lung cancer.
[15]Q. It may be the case, sir, that glyphosate is
[16]causally associated with every subtype of
[17]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and it may be the case that
[18]it's only associated with some of the subtypes and
[19]we can't tell the difference?
[20]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection.
[21]A. We don't have the data today to show
[22]either/or.
[23]Q. Yes, sir.
[24]And is there any particular subtype that,
[25]in your opinion, we have the data to say
  Page 107
[1]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma -- that specific subtype of
[2]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is caused by glyphosate, or
[3]can you not say that for any subtype?
[4]A. Yeah, I don't have an opinion today. What
[5]I have an opinion is that there is an association
[6]and a causation between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin
[7]lymphoma, meaning that it could actually impact all
[8]subtypes.
[9]Q. Yes, sir.
[10]You told us earlier that you read the
[11]deposition of plaintiffs' expert witness,
[12]epidemiologist Dr. Alfred Neugut; correct?
[13]A. I did.
[14]Q. And do you agree with him, sir, that the
[15]epidemiology alone is not sufficient to show a
[16]causal relationship between glyphosate and
[17]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[18]A. I -- it was a 400-page. I don't remember
[19]this is exactly what he said. Do you -- I mean --
[20]Q. Do you agree with that statement?
[21]A. Say the statement again.
[22]Q. Yes, sir.
[23]"The epidemiology alone is not sufficient
[24]to show a causal relationship between glyphosate and
[25]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
  Page 108
[1]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to
[2]mischaracterization in the testimony.
[3]A. If he meant by "not sufficient" as an
[4]absolute in terms of 100 percent, then I agree. You
[5]cannot -- you will never be able to say 100 percent
[6]because of the nature of what we are talking about.
[7]But you take the epidemiologic evidence in the
[8]context of the clinical scenarios and additional
[9]information and you try to form an opinion.
[10]So I agree with the fact that you cannot
[11]take just one piece of data or one piece of
[12]information and rely solely on it. You have to rely
[13]on everything to form an educated and a
[14]comprehensive opinion.
[15]Q. When you say that there is a causal
[16]relationship between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's
[17]lymphoma, you don't mean 100 percent; right?
[18]A. There is not 100 percent in life.
[19]Q. Okay. Well, I'm going to ask you this
[20]question again, whether you agree or disagree with
[21]this statement. And when -- when you answer it,
[22]please answer by your own standards of establishing
[23]a causal relationship, not 100 percent, but your own
[24]standards of what is sufficient to establish a
[25]causal relationship.
  Page 109
[1]Do you agree or disagree that the
[2]epidemiology alone is not sufficient to show a
[3]causal relationship between glyphosate and
[4]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[5]A. I disagree.
[6]Q. You believe that the epidemiology alone is
[7]sufficient to show a causal relationship?
[8]A. It can be if it's strong enough,
[9]absolutely.
[10]Q. I don't mean epidemiology as an abstract.
[11]I mean the epidemiology that you looked at on this
[12]subject.
[13]A. Okay. And what do you include in
[14]epidemiology? Are you including IARC? Is that part
[15]of epidemiology?
[16]I just went to make sure -- I mean, is IARC
[17]considered epidemiology literature?
[18]Q. I don't know. Do you consider it to be an
[19]epidemiology study?
[20]A. I do. But if you don't, then I -- I want
[21]to make sure I answer the right question.
[22]Q. Okay.
[23]A. Is it the original epidemiology data? Or,
[24]I mean, the IARC, for example, took -- I mean, to me
[25]it's obviously part of epidemiology. It looked
  Page 110
[1]concisely at all of the literature, and they
[2]generated a peer-reviewed manuscript that is easily
[3]researchable and publishable and I read it. And
[4]meta-analysis is part of epidemiology literature,
[5]but if you're just talking about the actual paper,
[6]it may be different.
[7]So in my opinion, there are -- there are
[8]situations where the epidemiology literature is
[9]sufficient to establish causation. And based on my
[10]review of the epidemiology literature for
[11]glyphosate, I see sufficient evidence to demonstrate
[12]causation.
[13]Q. Okay. And when you said that sentence,
[14]what did you mean by "epidemiology evidence"?
[15]A. I meant the original papers of epidemiology
[16]that I reviewed, plus the IARC, plus the
[17]meta-analyses, plus, you know, some of the review
[18]articles that I looked at.
[19]Q. And what review articles are you talking
[20]about?
[21]A. They -- they -- I mean, they -- again, they
[22]were included in the -- I mean, maybe I --
[23]meta-analysis, I consider them sometimes part of
[24]review because they're not original data. So the
[25]meta-analysis, they're really reviewing the actual
  Page 111
[1]collective type of research. So I -- that's what I
[2]meant by review articles per se.
[3]Q. Okay. And IARC is also a review article in
[4]that sentence because it didn't generate new data?
[5]A. Yeah. No, IARC --
[6]Q. It reviewed --
[7]A. -- did not have original data. They looked
[8]at the available data, and they came up with a
[9]robust conclusion.
[10]Q. So when you say that the epidemiology -- in
[11]your opinion, the epidemiology alone is sufficient
[12]to show a causal relationship between glyphosate and
[13]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, you're including the
[14]original epidemiology studies and IARC in that;
[15]right?
[16]A. I am, and the meta-analysis.
[17]Q. And if you take IARC out, do you still feel
[18]it's sufficient?
[19]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. It's been
[20]asked and answered this morning.
[21]A. You really can't keep asking me about
[22]taking evidence out. I mean, I'm sorry, but I
[23]cannot comment on -- on taking stuff out and what I
[24]conclude. This is the third time.
[25]I can't -- I don't know what I would
  Page 112
[1]conclude if I take some of the evidence that I
[2]reviewed out.
[3]Q. Okay. Sir --
[4]A. It's not fair.
[5]Q. The thing about IARC is that it is not
[6]original data.
[7]A. It's paper in Lancet.
[8]Q. It is not original data.
[9]A. But it's in Lancet.
[10]Q. It's a review article; right?
[11]A. It's not a review article. It's in Lancet.
[12]Have you tried publishing in Lancet? They reject
[13]the 95 percent of the papers. So I think this is
[14]not fair. Lancet will not accept papers unless they
[15]go through peer-review process and robust evidence.
[16]So whether it's a review article,
[17]meta-analysis, collection of research, it's gone
[18]through the peer-review process. And there was
[19]sufficient information in there to generate a
[20]publication in the most prestigious, most
[21]competitive journal that we have.
[22]Q. To what extent did you substitute the
[23]judgment of the authors of the Lancet article for
[24]your own, sir, in reviewing the original data?
[25]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
  Page 113
[1]A. I don't re-perform a peer review. This is
[2]not my job. All published papers have gone through
[3]peer-review process before they get published. They
[4]sometimes have three peers, four peers, four -- five
[5]peers, whatever the journal policy is.
[6]And, as you know, the process, the peers
[7]provide comments and they might go back and forth.
[8]And sometimes papers take six months until they get
[9]published.
[10]So I did not re-conduct a formal
[11]peer-review process for this paper nor for all other
[12]papers, frankly. I -- I look at the paper, look at
[13]the evidence, and look at the totality of
[14]information that's available.
[15]But this does not mean that I substituted
[16]my judgment. There's a difference between you being
[17]a peer reviewer for a particular paper or just
[18]basically reading the paper, taking the conclusion,
[19]and putting it in the context of other research
[20]that's available.
[21]Q. Do you agree with Dr. Neugut that there is
[22]no epidemiology study that reports a statistically
[23]significant association between glyphosate and
[24]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma adjusted for other pesticide
[25]exposures?
  Page 114
[1]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to the
[2]mischaracterization.
[3]A. I don't remember -- do I -- I don't
[4]remember that particular statement.
[5]Q. Do you agree with the statement, whether he
[6]said it or not, then?
[7]A. That there is no positive association
[8]between --
[9]Q. There is no epidemiology study that reports
[10]a statistically significant association between
[11]glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma once you
[12]control for other pesticide exposures.
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: Same objection.
[14]A. I -- I don't remember -- I know that not
[15]all studies were able to control for other
[16]exposures. That's for sure. It just was very
[17]difficult.
[18]I don't recall -- you know, I have to -- I
[19]wrote the few studies here to remember. I don't
[20]recall if no study has controlled for everything. I
[21]know some studies try to control and some studies
[22]did not.
[23]So I'll agree, but I will -- I have some
[24]reservation because I want to make sure I review all
[25]of these studies as well. If he said that, then,
  Page 115
[1]for the most part, it's going to be correct. But I
[2]know for a fact that some studies did actually
[3]attempt to control. I just don't know if these were
[4]statistically significant or not. I'll have to
[5]review that.
[6]Q. Okay. We'll go over epidemiology later.
[7]A. No problem.
[8]Q. You don't know -- without going through
[9]each study, you don't know if there is a single
[10]statistically significant association in the
[11]epidemiology that can -- once you control for other
[12]pesticide exposures?
[13]A. Yeah, I don't know that. I know that there
[14]were attempts to control.
[15]Q. Why would it be important to control for
[16]other pesticides?
[17]A. As we said earlier, I mean, I think you
[18]always want to try to control for other pesticide
[19]exposures to eliminate contamination if you can. I
[20]mean, obviously -- I mean, here's how you'd look at
[21]things. So if you have contamination where there's
[22]exposure to other pesticides, then it might cloud
[23]the picture. It might increase the risk of
[24]developing lymphoma or other cancers.
[25]Having said that, in general, if you have
  Page 116
[1]the similar exposure rate between cases and
[2]controls, then they actually, you know, wash out,
[3]technically.
[4]Q. That's why you do the controlling; right?
[5]A. And you try to control --
[6]Q. Why you do the statistical controls, to see
[7]if washes out; right?
[8]A. Exactly. You want to try to always control
[9]for both to see if it's actual the same. But, you
[10]know, I acknowledge, and I think everybody that, you
[11]know, look at this or have done some of this
[12]research will always have to acknowledge, that it's
[13]not always possible in a case-control study to do
[14]these controlling for confounding factors.
[15]It is very different when you're doing
[16]prospective randomized control study. You can
[17]actually control for certain things in the
[18]randomization process.
[19]So I don't think it's really because of
[20]lack of attempt. I think it's the inherent
[21]limitation of these studies to be able to
[22]scientifically control for confounding factors
[23]between both cohorts in a robust manner.
[24]Q. Do you have any opinion, sir, about how, in
[25]a human being, glyphosate would gain access to human
  Page 117
[1]lymph cells in a way that could cause them to become
[2]carcinogenic?
[3]A. I have some opinion, but I want to maybe
[4]just mention a couple of things.
[5]It is -- it's very difficult to sometimes
[6]know the exact mechanism of action of any
[7]carcinogen. I think, you know, we have a body of
[8]evidence in oncology. And, as a cancer specialist
[9]who've done this for over 17 years, there's a body
[10]of evidence to show that sometimes we don't really
[11]understand the mechanism by which, A, a drug causes
[12]cancer -- even drug works. You know, we have drugs
[13]that actually work in cancer that we don't know how
[14]they work.
[15]I think there's good data on -- on how it
[16]causes chromosomal aberrations and causes
[17]chromosomal and DNA breakage which might predispose
[18]the cells to developing cancer or -- and/or
[19]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. So there is some evidence
[20]of that. There is some evidence that I cite in my
[21]expert report on oxidative stress as well that might
[22]be a plausible mechanism of action.
[23]But it's -- there is no one way that you
[24]can say, well, this is how this is actually caused.
[25]The same way I view as many drugs in treating
  Page 118
[1]patients that I knew that they worked but we still
[2]didn't know exactly how they actually worked. And
[3]years later there was research into how this drug --
[4]why this drug was effective and so forth.
[5]So it's not unusual to see that in cancer,
[6]at least in my experience.
[7]Q. Okay. First of all, sir, I'm going to
[8]circle back to what I originally asked you, but I
[9]want to ask you some other things first based on
[10]your answer.
[11]Do you claim, to a reasonable degree of
[12]medical certainty, that oxidative stress is a
[13]mechanism by which glyphosate, in fact, causes
[14]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in human beings?
[15]A. It's probably one of the mechanisms. It is
[16]unlikely to be the sole mechanism. There is no such
[17]a thing as sole mechanism.
[18]Q. Okay. Are you claiming that it is one of
[19]the mechanisms?
[20]A. It is likely one of the mechanisms to a
[21]certain degree of medical probability.
[22]Q. And do you claim that genotoxicity is one
[23]of the mechanisms by which glyphosate causes
[24]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to a reasonable degree of
[25]medical certainty?
  Page 119
[1]A. I do believe it's one of the other
[2]mechanisms, yes.
[3]Q. Now, you know about the Smith and Guyton
[4]article on key characteristics of carcinogens, sir?
[5]A. I -- can I see it? I don't know what --
[6]Q. Yes, sir.
[7](Nabhan Exhibit 7 marked for
[8]identification.)
[9]A. I have not reviewed that paper before.
[10]Q. Well, turn, please, to page -- first of
[11]all, do you see that it's written by Kathryn Guyton,
[12]Christopher Portier, Ivan Rusyn, some of the other
[13]people who were involved in the IARC monograph, sir?
[14]A. I do see that, yeah.
[15]Q. And I will tell you for your information
[16]that this is a theory paper that was generated by
[17]the authors here, the authors listed here, listing
[18]characteristics that IARC would, in the future, look
[19]for in identifying carcinogens, sir.
[20]A. Okay.
[21]Q. And if you turn to page 715, do you see
[22]where those characteristics are listed?
[23]A. I see that, yes.
[24]Q. In the bold?
[25]A. Uh-hum. So this is to demonstrate
  Page 120
[1]characteristics for carcinogenesis. Okay.
[2]Q. And it says here that "Not every carcinogen
[3]will have all these characteristics."
[4]A. Right.
[5]Q. "Having a characteristic doesn't
[6]necessarily mean that something is a carcinogen, but
[7]we will look for these characteristics in
[8]identifying carcinogens," in a nutshell?
[9]A. Uh-hum.
[10]Q. And you would agree with that approach. Is
[11]that fair to say? Or do you not know?
[12]A. No, I actually like standardization. I
[13]think it's very good to have a mechanism by which
[14]you look at carcinogenicity. When you standardize
[15]the approach, this actually is a better way of
[16]looking at things. It doesn't -- but they
[17]acknowledge, obviously, that you can't meet all of
[18]the criteria and so forth. But it's good -- it's
[19]probably a good starting point to standardize
[20]things.
[21]Q. And you know that the IARC found evidence
[22]for Characteristic 2, that glyphosate was genotoxic,
[23]and Characteristic 5, that glyphosate induces
[24]oxidative stress; correct?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 121
[1]Q. And in reading the IARC monograph, did you
[2]see that they reached a conclusion as to every
[3]single one of the other characteristics and said
[4]that there is not -- no evidence or inadequate
[5]evidence for the other characteristics?
[6]A. Well, I don't know if they looked at every
[7]single one, because this paper was published in
[8]June '16 and the IARC paper was in '15. So I doubt
[9]that they did because this appears to be
[10]characteristics that they actually brought up a year
[11]after the IARC was published. So I -- I doubt that
[12]they did, but I --
[13]Q. Okay. They did, but let's see whether we
[14]need to go through and find them all.
[15]A. I don't know. Yeah, no problem.
[16]Q. Do you claim that glyphosate is
[17]electrophilic or can be metabolically activated to
[18]electrophiles, Characteristic 1?
[19]A. I'm not qualified to answer this question.
[20]Q. Do you claim that it alters DNA repair or
[21]causes genomic instability?
[22]A. I believe there was some data that it
[23]causes DNA breakage and chromosomal aberrations. So
[24]I believe there is some data to that that I looked
[25]at.
  Page 122
[1]Q. And do you disagree with IARC that the data
[2]on that was not conclusive?
[3]A. I said there is data. It may have not been
[4]conclusive. But I think your question was -- I
[5]think if you want to repeat the question, you said,
[6]do you believe that it causes DNA repair, genomic
[7]instability? I said I saw some data to that effect.
[8]Q. Okay. Do you claim, to a reasonable degree
[9]of medical certainty, that that is a mechanism by
[10]which glyphosate causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[11]A. I don't know. I don't know if it is.
[12]Q. Do you claim to a reasonable degree of
[13]medical certainty that inducing epigenetic
[14]operations, Characteristic 4, is a mechanism by
[15]which glyphosate causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[16]A. I don't believe there's sufficient data to
[17]look at the epigenetic alterations of glyphosate.
[18]Q. Let's look at --
[19]A. Just as an FYI.
[20]Q. Yes, sir?
[21]A. The epigenetics is not something we knew
[22]about until less than ten years ago. I mean, it's
[23]not something that people even know what epigenetics
[24]meant.
[25]So, again, this actually tells you, in '16,
  Page 123
[1]now that we know a lot of things, let's apply our
[2]knowledge and standardize how we approach things.
[3]But if you ask somebody in '95 or in 2000 about
[4]epigenetics, they would just say, "What is that?"
[5]Q. Characteristic 6, sir. Do you claim, to a
[6]reasonable degree of medical certainty, that
[7]glyphosate causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by inducing
[8]chronic inflammation?
[9]A. I don't know.
[10]Q. Do you claim, to a reasonable degree of
[11]medical certainty, that glyphosate causes
[12]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by immunosuppression?
[13]A. There's not enough data to show that.
[14]Q. Or by immunomodulation, for that matter?
[15]A. I have not seen sufficient data for that.
[16]Q. Do you claim, sir, to a reasonable degree
[17]of medical certainty, that glyphosate causes
[18]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by modulating
[19]receptor-mediated effects?
[20]A. Again, I have not seen data to that -- to
[21]that characteristic.
[22]Q. Do you claim, to a reasonable degree of
[23]medical certainty, that glyphosate causes
[24]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by causing immortalization?
[25]A. Can you define "immortalization" for me?
  Page 124
[1]Because there is data on apoptosis and affecting the
[2]apoptotic pathways and that glyphosate could
[3]actually inhibit the ability for the cells to die.
[4]And it does affect the apoptosis. So if that's what
[5]they mean by immortalization, there's some data.
[6]I'm not sure, again, how robust that data is there,
[7]but it's there.
[8]Q. Yes, sir. I mean, you'll be testifying as
[9]an expert, and I'm -- this is my chance to ask you
[10]questions --
[11]A. But this is not my area of expertise.
[12]Q. Okay. Do you claim, to a reasonable degree
[13]of medical certainty, that this is a mechanism by
[14]which glyphosate causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[15]A. I don't know if it does.
[16]Q. Do you claim, to a reasonable degree of
[17]medical certainty, that glyphosate alters cell
[18]proliferation, cell death, or nutrient supply and,
[19]by that mechanism, causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[20]A. Again, I don't -- I don't know if this is
[21]the case.
[22]Q. Do you claim, sir, to a reasonable degree
[23]of medical certainty, that glyphosate can initiate
[24]as opposed to promote cancer?
[25]A. I don't think the -- I don't think that we
  Page 125
[1]have evidence that it does one versus the other.
[2]And I think it's a very gray area between initiation
[3]or -- or promoting or -- or helping. It's very
[4]gray. So it's not clear how it does that.
[5]Again, I mean, it's -- it's -- I'll say
[6]this: Not understanding the mechanism of action of
[7]a particular compound, whether it works against
[8]cancer or it causes cancer, is not something unusual
[9]for us who have dealt with cancer for 20 years.
[10]This happens all the time. I have hundreds
[11]of examples I can provide in the lack of our
[12]understanding of causation or mechanistic,
[13]et cetera.
[14]So -- so I don't know whether this is
[15]something that is one of the mechanisms of action,
[16]and nor is it also important to know the mechanism
[17]of action. A lot of times the studies of mechanism
[18]on action come after the fact, after you actually
[19]show that there's a problem. Like, okay, well,
[20]there's a problem. Let's try to figure out why,
[21]because then we can eliminate other compounds or
[22]other things that may have similar mechanisms of
[23]action.
[24]So, you know, I mean, to me, I don't think
[25]we understand fully the mechanism of action, but we
  Page 126
[1]have enough evidence in terms of affecting DNA,
[2]genotoxicity, oxidative stress.
[3]So there's a plausible evidence out there
[4]that it does cause malignancy, but I don't think we
[5]have the full picture.
[6]Q. Do you know of any evidence saying that
[7]glyphosate causes -- glyphosate promotes
[8]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as opposed to initiating
[9]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[10]A. What do you mean by promote versus
[11]initiate? Just so I understand so I answer
[12]accurately. What's the difference in your mind?
[13]Q. Tell me what the difference is.
[14]A. Well, I told you I don't think there is --
[15]I think it's very gray. That's what I was just
[16]trying to say. I said that I think to try -- and,
[17]again, we always try to go back to -- you know, I
[18]don't believe you can say it's promotes versus
[19]initiate versus -- I mean, this is -- these
[20]terminologies are very vague and they're very gray.
[21]That's why, if you want an answer, I need to
[22]understand your definition.
[23]In my definition, I don't believe it
[24]matters. I don't believe there's -- I don't believe
[25]the discussion of whether it promotes or initiates
  Page 127
[1]or something is very fruitful at all. It doesn't
[2]really matter. It doesn't take away or add
[3]anything. I don't look at -- I don't evaluate a
[4]substance from that angle.
[5]Q. Okay, sir. You agree with me that the
[6]transformation of healthy cells into cancer cells is
[7]a multistage process?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And it involves many, many molecular
[10]transformations in the cell?
[11]A. Sometimes, yes.
[12]Q. Healthy cells are undergoing oxidative
[13]stress and DNA damage all the time without turning
[14]into cancer cells?
[15]A. If you have the proper repair mechanism,
[16]you don't always turn into cancer, that's correct.
[17]Q. Like thousands of DNA -- thousands of
[18]damages to --
[19]A. Yes. If you go in the sun -- you go in the
[20]sun, you could have oxidative stress, but it doesn't
[21]mean you're going to melanoma right away. Sometimes
[22]you have the proper repair mechanism; sometimes you
[23]don't.
[24]Q. The sun causes oxidative stress to your
[25]cells?
  Page 128
[1]A. Radiation. I mean --
[2]Q. Yes.
[3]A. I brought this on. I mean, radiation
[4]causes DNA damages, for example, and you can repair
[5]the DNA if you have the proper repair mechanism.
[6]Q. Another cause of oxidative stress is
[7]exercise?
[8]A. Don't know.
[9]Q. You don't know?
[10]A. That's a problem, if exercise cause
[11]oxidative stress. I don't know if exercise causes
[12]oxidative stress. Don't know that.
[13]Q. Every cell in your body is undergoing
[14]oxidative stress and dealing with that oxidative
[15]stress all the time; right?
[16]A. Yeah. I just -- you asked me if exercise
[17]induces that, and I don't know if that's the case.
[18]You're right -- your first comment is accurate.
[19]Q. Okay.
[20]A. I think cells go through oxidative stress.
[21]And sometimes you are able to repair things;
[22]sometimes you can't repair things. But I'm not sure
[23]if exercises causes oxidative stress or not.
[24]Q. Okay. So you don't know about the specific
[25]one.
  Page 129
[1]A. But there are certainly compounds that
[2]could increase the oxidative stress beyond the
[3]body's ability to repair, and that is where problems
[4]happen. I mean, there's -- the body is in constant
[5]balance. There's a constant balance. I mean, what
[6]cancer is at the end is cell growth -- cells grow
[7]and cells die. So if the balance shifts towards
[8]cells growing and proliferating versus cells dying,
[9]that's where tumors form and cancer develop.
[10]And so if you have oxidative stress in your
[11]body beyond your body's ability to repair things,
[12]then it could just shift that balance, and then
[13]tumors could develop.
[14]Q. At a minimum for cancer to develop, there
[15]has to be damage to DNA that is not repaired and
[16]then that is copied successfully and that is of a
[17]sort that alters the genetic machinery of the cell
[18]towards growth and --
[19]A. And proliferation.
[20]Q. -- immortalization; correct?
[21]A. Yeah. Basically, something happens where
[22]these cells continue to grow, and they grow in an
[23]exponential manner that cancer develops. Sometimes
[24]we know why they grew, because of genomic
[25]aberrations, molecular alterations, et cetera. And
  Page 130
[1]sometimes we don't, and we try to study why these
[2]happen.
[3]Q. And the first step in that process, the
[4]damage to the DNA, is something that happens
[5]naturally, endogenously, all the time in every cell
[6]in your body but it's repaired ordinarily; correct?
[7]A. It doesn't happen all the time. I mean,
[8]are you having DNA damage now? I mean, it doesn't
[9]happen all the time. We are not in a constant DNA
[10]damage, in a constant -- our body is not in a
[11]constant battle between cells trying to die and
[12]cells to proliferate. That's not accurate.
[13]I think, you know, there are certain
[14]environmental, certain pathogens, certain other
[15]factors that get in the body that induces oxidative
[16]stress and other mechanisms, and then the body
[17]reacts. Either you are able to repair or not. If
[18]you are able to repair, you overcome the problem.
[19]If you are not, then you shift towards cancer.
[20]But I don't think it's fair to say that, as
[21]we are sitting here, the six of us, we have DNA
[22]damage happening around the clock.
[23](Nabhan Exhibit 8 marked for
[24]identification.)
[25]Q. Exhibit 8, sir, is an article in the
  Page 131
[1]journal Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology by James
[2]Klaunig, et al., entitled "Oxidative stress and
[3]oxidative damage in chemical carcinogenesis."
[4]Do you see that?
[5]A. I do see that.
[6]Q. And do you see that in the introduction
[7]section they say that the steps of cancer induction
[8]have been identified as initiation, promotion, and
[9]progression?
[10]A. That's this author's opinion, yes.
[11]Q. And you disagree with him on that?
[12]A. I don't disagree with him. But the
[13]accurate thing is that this is their opinion, not
[14]mine.
[15]Q. And on page 89, sir.
[16]A. Okay.
[17]Q. Under the heading "Oxidative DNA damage."
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. Do you see in the third sentence in that
[20]section that the estimated frequency of oxidative
[21]DNA damage is at 10 to the power of 4 lesions per
[22]cell per day in humans?
[23]A. I see that sentence, yes.
[24]Q. 10 to the 4 would be 10,000 lesions per
[25]cell per day oxidative damage?
  Page 132
[1]A. Uh-hum. I see that.
[2]Q. So that would be endogenous DNA damage to
[3]human cells caused by oxidative; correct?
[4]A. That's what they're saying.
[5]Q. And 10 -- so that would be 10,000 points of
[6]DNA damage per cell in your body every day; right?
[7]A. How are you making -- how are you doing
[8]this math, please?
[9]Q. 10 to the 4th?
[10]A. Okay. That's 10,000.
[11]Q. Yes, sir.
[12]A. Yeah, that's what they said. So 10,000
[13]lesions per cell per day in humans.
[14]Q. Right. So it is the case that, as we sit
[15]here, we're constantly undergoing oxidative DNA
[16]damage and that damage is, for the most part, being
[17]repaired; correct sir?
[18]A. Again, I don't know the reference. I'm
[19]trying to look at the references. I mean, you just
[20]gave me this paper right now that I have never seen.
[21]And I think, you know, if we -- if the discussion is
[22]about oxidative stress, then I'm sure there are
[23]papers that would debate this or not debate this and
[24]so forth.
[25]But the conclusion, what I was trying to
  Page 133
[1]say, is that oxidative stress is something that the
[2]human body does encounter. I don't know the
[3]frequency or what factors induces oxidative stress
[4]per se. But what I know, when certain factors that
[5]increase oxidative stress, either the body responds
[6]by countering the oxidative stress or there's no
[7]mechanism to counter the oxidative stress.
[8]That's really all I can say on the subject.
[9]I mean, I -- you know, I will have to look at these
[10]references and so forth. I don't even know who the
[11]authors are.
[12]Q. Okay, sir. So this is something you just
[13]don't know about?
[14]A. I know enough about, but you've just given
[15]me a paper that I have not seen and you're asking me
[16]to comment, and you're just giving me one sentence
[17]on page 3 that -- and you want me to comment on
[18]that. I mean, so I think -- I think there's a
[19]difference between not knowing the subject versus
[20]not knowing this paper.
[21]Q. Okay, sir. Do you know or do you not know
[22]whether every cell in your body is undergoing
[23]thousands of point damage to DNA from oxidative
[24]stress every day?
[25]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. Asked and
  Page 134
[1]answered.
[2]A. I think I answered that. I already
[3]answered that.
[4]Q. And you answered that it may be the case;
[5]you don't know?
[6]A. I think the answer is maybe, but there
[7]are -- again, not going to repeat the same answer.
[8]Q. Now, on the subject of glyphosate, sir, and
[9]carcinogenesis, for purposes of this question, I'm
[10]going to define "initiation" as what we've just been
[11]talking about: Damage to the DNA that then may or
[12]may not be repaired that may or may not cause
[13]problems later. I'm going to call that initiation.
[14]So do you have the opinion that glyphosate
[15]causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma other than by that, by
[16]initiation, by causing initial damage to the DNA,
[17]that may or may not be repaired later?
[18]A. I think there are certain -- certainly,
[19]there are possibilities that it might. We just
[20]don't know yet. I -- you know, again -- and I am
[21]more than happy to give you lots of examples, but
[22]this is what we know today, and maybe in a couple
[23]years there will be additional research to suggest
[24]different mechanism of action by which glyphosate
[25]causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
  Page 135
[1]So I -- I don't believe -- I don't believe
[2]there's any sole mechanism. I believe that we are
[3]still exploring this information and there's not
[4]enough data to show that this is exactly just the
[5]mechanism of action by which a drug works or a
[6]compound causes an occupational hazard.
[7]Q. In your expert report, sir.
[8]A. Sure.
[9]Q. I'm on page 10.
[10]A. Okay.
[11]Q. In the last paragraph on that page, third
[12]sentence, you say, "The U.S. EPA analyzed
[13]immunotoxicity studies in mice exposed to glyphosate
[14]and issued a report on February 2013, the results of
[15]which were essentially negative."
[16]Correct?
[17]A. I see that, yes.
[18]Q. And what report were you referring to
[19]there, sir?
[20]A. I don't remember it. I mean, I -- that's
[21]what -- I mean, I -- I recall reading the EPA
[22]report. I don't have it handy with me, but I'm sure
[23]I can find it.
[24]Q. Okay. And then you said, "These
[25]observations were in contrast with other studies
  Page 136
[1]where lethal toxicity was demonstrated in other
[2]organisms." Correct?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And what studies were you talking about and
[5]what other organisms were you talking about?
[6]A. I think what I meant by "organisms" is just
[7]living cells. I mean, there are some -- some
[8]studies that looked at lymphocytes -- bovine
[9]lymphocytes, some studies that look at the actual
[10]center or level that demonstrated some genotoxicity
[11]in DNA breakage. And that's really what I was
[12]referring to.
[13]Q. Okay. And when you're talking about bovine
[14]lymphocytes, that's a study on page 9 of your
[15]report --
[16]A. That's one of the studies, yeah.
[17]Q. -- Sivakova. And that's an in vitro study;
[18]right?
[19]A. Right.
[20]Q. Glyphosate was placed directly onto cow
[21]lymphocyte cells; right?
[22]A. Right.
[23]Q. And Peluso, which you mentioned next, was
[24]also an in vitro study. Glyphosate was placed
[25]directly in contact with cells?
  Page 137
[1]A. Right.
[2]Q. And then you say, "These findings are
[3]critical as they have been observed in humans," and
[4]you go on in the next paragraph to talk about a
[5]biomonitoring -- two biomonitoring studies,
[6]Paz-y-Mino and Bolognesi; right?
[7]A. I do.
[8]Q. And that's what you mean by they've been
[9]observed in humans? You mean those two studies,
[10]right, Paz-y-Mino and Bolognesi; right?
[11]A. These are the ones that I found more
[12]substantial.
[13]Q. Okay.
[14]A. So I -- I think -- you know, it's always
[15]difficult to -- it's not an easy process to actually
[16]demonstrate, right. I mean, you have to have the
[17]occupation. Plus you have to analyze, collect
[18]blood, and do all of these things.
[19]Logistically, it's not always the easiest
[20]thing to do. So I found these studies to be
[21]interesting and informative.
[22]Q. And in what way were they important to your
[23]analysis?
[24]A. Well, specifically the Bolognesi paper
[25]where you have -- again, you saw the -- I think --
  Page 138
[1]I'm sure you're aware of the paper where they --
[2]they looked at the micronuclei presence in
[3]patients -- not patients -- in individuals that were
[4]exposed, and the presence of these micronuclei is a
[5]sign of genotoxicity.
[6]So they took blood samples before they
[7]spray with glyphosate, five days after, and again
[8]four months after spraying. And they discovered the
[9]micronuclei in the lymphocytes of individuals
[10]exposed to glyphosate.
[11]So at least to me this is somewhat of an
[12]evidence that the exposure to glyphosate does cause
[13]damage by the presence of these micronuclei, which
[14]is a sign of genotoxicity.
[15]Q. How reliable did you find that study to be?
[16]A. I found it to be informative.
[17]Q. What is the difference between informative
[18]and reliable, sir?
[19]A. There's really no difference. I mean,
[20]just -- I'm not -- do you have a difference? I
[21]mean, is informative different than reliable?
[22]Q. I don't -- is it to you?
[23]A. No. I want to make sure I answer the
[24]question as you -- based on your question. So to
[25]me, they're about the same. Informative and
  Page 139
[1]reliable is the same. But if you have a different
[2]definition, I'd like to make sure I -- I don't want
[3]to answer the wrong question.
[4]Q. You found these studies to be persuasive
[5]that glyphosate could cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[6]in humans?
[7]A. I think to the -- well, no. These --
[8]genotoxicity, this is --
[9]Q. It was in support of your opinion that
[10]glyphosate --
[11]A. Well, right. Right. But I think these
[12]studies are supportive of causing genotoxicity.
[13]These studies did not necessarily talk about
[14]non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They just talk about the fact
[15]that glyphosate exposure causes genotoxicity.
[16]I found the evidence to be compelling given
[17]the difficulty in demonstrating something like this.
[18]It's not something easy to actually demonstrate. So
[19]I actually believe the authors try to do a good job
[20]in understanding whether there's any evidence of
[21]genotoxicity or not.
[22](Nabhan Exhibit 9 marked for
[23]identification.)
[24]Q. Wait a second. Hand me that back, please.
[25]I need to mark the right one.
  Page 140
[1]A. (Witness complies.)
[2]Q. Okay. Sir, this is Paz-y-Mino study from
[3]2011 that you cited in your expert report --
[4]A. Yep.
[5]Q. -- on page 9.
[6]And this is a study in which various people
[7]who were undergoing aerial spraying with glyphosate
[8]near the border of Colombia were compared to some
[9]controls; is that right?
[10]A. Uh-hum. Yes.
[11]Q. And take a look at the abstract where it
[12]says towards the bottom, "In conclusion." The
[13]conclusion of the authors here was, "In conclusion
[14]the study population did not present significant
[15]chromosomal and DNA alterations."
[16]Correct?
[17]A. I see that.
[18]Q. So this was a negative study; right?
[19]A. Well, depends how you really interpret
[20]this. I mean, I think the reality is that there
[21]was -- there was evidence of chromosomal damage and
[22]DNA alterations. It did not reach statistical
[23]significance, and I think that's really different.
[24]So -- so sometimes -- you know, the fact
[25]that there was -- and we talked about this earlier.
  Page 141
[1]The fact that, in some of these studies, you don't
[2]have the statistical significance defined as a
[3]P value less than 0.05 could be related to the
[4]number of cases, the way the study was done. And it
[5]might be related -- it's just a number game -- the
[6]number of folks that were actually in the study.
[7]So you look at the trend and you look at
[8]the entire evidence, taken this study plus other
[9]studies involved.
[10]Q. Under "Chromosomal Analysis" on page 48,
[11]sir, it says, "After analyzing the meta-phases and
[12]karyotyping the 92 individuals who belonged to the
[13]different communities of the province of Sucumbios,
[14]located in Ecuador's northeastern border, we
[15]observed that all the analyzed women obtained a
[16]normal karyotype."
[17]Right?
[18]A. I see that, yes.
[19]Q. And there is no statistical trend, much
[20]less statistically significant association, between
[21]glyphosate exposure and genetic damage in this
[22]study; right?
[23]A. I don't see this in this paragraph. I'll
[24]have to read the whole paper, because I remember
[25]reading this paper. I'll have to reread it.
  Page 142
[1]Q. At the bottom of page 50, sir, it says,
[2]"Regarding our study" -- it's the very last partial
[3]sentence at the bottom of page 50, the first column.
[4]"Regarding our study, we obtained results showing no
[5]chromosomal alterations in the analyzed
[6]individuals."
[7]Correct?
[8]A. (Speaking sotto voce.)
[9]I see that, yes.
[10]Q. Everything we've looked at is negative;
[11]correct?
[12]A. In this study, it appears that the authors
[13]believe there is very little association with
[14]chromosomal aberration.
[15]Q. They didn't even say very little; they said
[16]none. Right?
[17]A. That's what they said, yes.
[18]Q. Okay.
[19](Nabhan Exhibit 10 marked for
[20]identification.)
[21]Q. I'm marking as Exhibit 10 the Bolognesi
[22]2009, which is the other paper that you cited in
[23]your expert report on genotoxicity; correct?
[24]A. Correct.
[25](Whereupon a discussion was had off the
  Page 143
[1]record.)
[2]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[3]Q. All right. So this study involved -- was
[4]looking at micronucleus formation in subjects from
[5]five regions in Columbia, again where aerial -- in
[6]some of those areas, aerial spraying of glyphosate
[7]was being done; correct?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And the highest frequency that was found
[10]was in an area where no aerial spraying was being
[11]done; correct?
[12]A. Which page is that?
[13]Q. It's in the abstract, "The highest
[14]frequency --"
[15]A. I see that.
[16]Q. -- of BNMN was in Boyacá" -- or Boyacá --
[17]"where no aerial eradication spraying of glyphosate
[18]was conducted."
[19]A. I see that, yes.
[20]Q. And then on the next column of the
[21]abstract, "The increase in frequency of BNMN" --
[22]what's BNMN by the way?
[23]A. The micronuclei.
[24]Q. Okay. So that's --
[25]A. MN is micronuclei.
  Page 144
[1]Q. -- the indicator of genotoxicity that we're
[2]looking for in this study; right?
[3]A. Yeah, it's one of the indicators that's
[4]used for genotoxicity.
[5]Q. So the increase in frequency of BNMN
[6]observed immediately after the glyphosate spraying
[7]was not consistent with the rates of application
[8]used in the regions, and there was no association
[9]between self-reported direct contact with
[10]eradication sprays and frequency of BNMN; right?
[11]A. Yes, I see that.
[12]Q. And then the -- the end of the conclusion
[13]of the abstract is, "Evidence indicates that the
[14]genotoxic risk potentially associated with exposure
[15]to glyphosate in the areas where the herbicide is
[16]applied for coca and poppy eradication is low;
[17]right?
[18]A. That's the conclusion of the authors.
[19]Q. So they did not find any dose -- any
[20]relationship with dose in --
[21]A. That's not unusual. I mean, not everything
[22]is dose-dependent, especially in cancer. I mean,
[23]there are many drugs that we use that are class
[24]effect. You give a drug that causes a side effect,
[25]whether it's 10 milligram or 100 milligram, because
  Page 145
[1]it's a class effect.
[2]Just because you give 100 milligram, it
[3]doesn't mean you're going to have more side effect
[4]all the time. There are many examples of this.
[5]So, I mean, I think the dose relation, to
[6]me, is not -- what I take from this paper is the
[7]fact that there is evidence that there is
[8]genotoxicity that is associated with this compound.
[9]And it's very hard to control, when you're just
[10]spraying aerially in these regions, to be
[11]100 percent certain how this is -- it's very
[12]difficult to -- to really control for.
[13]But in my opinion, the dose is not always
[14]associated with the actual output, especially in
[15]cancer.
[16]Q. For genotoxicity of the sort that's
[17]measured in this -- that they tried to measure in
[18]this study, to lead to cancer, it would need to
[19]cause persistent DNA breaks, not just temporary
[20]ones; correct?
[21]A. I don't agree with that. I think, if you
[22]have a DNA break that is not repaired, you -- it
[23]could manifest, you know, typically later on and
[24]develop cancer. It's not -- if it's not repaired
[25]right now and it's still having a damage, it doesn't
  Page 146
[1]mean you're going to have cancer tomorrow. I mean,
[2]that's well known.
[3]Q. Right.
[4]If there are DNA breaks --
[5]A. And it's not --
[6]Q. -- and they're repaired, they will not
[7]cause cancer; and if they aren't repaired, they
[8]could cause cancer. Is that fair?
[9]A. If there is a DNA breakage and it's
[10]repaired and everything is back to normal, the cell
[11]then -- then other mechanisms could be contributing
[12]to the evolution or the development of cancer, not
[13]this particular mechanism.
[14]If the DNA breakage is witnessed and it's
[15]not repaired, then -- then it might contribute
[16]developing cancer, but that could actually happen
[17]later on, not necessarily now.
[18]Q. And in this study, they didn't come back
[19]and look to see whether any of these breaks were
[20]persistent; right?
[21]A. I don't think it's logistically possible.
[22]But, to my knowledge, they have not. I mean, you
[23]have to follow up this population for a long, long
[24]time.
[25]Q. DNA breaks is the same thing that we were
  Page 147
[1]talking about earlier when we were looking at the
[2]Klaunig article about 10,000 lesions per cell per
[3]day in the human body; right? Those are DNA breaks?
[4]A. I think that was oxidative stress --
[5]Q. Yes, sir.
[6]A. -- if that's what you just mentioned.
[7]Q. DNA breaks due to oxidative stress.
[8]A. I think the -- it says here, "Estimate
[9]frequency of oxidative DNA damage." I mean, there
[10]are DNA -- DNA could be damaged by mechanisms
[11]outside of oxidative stress.
[12]Q. Oh, sure.
[13]A. Right. I mean, so this -- the Klaunig
[14]paper, I think they're talking about the DNA damage
[15]specifically for oxidative stress. I just want to
[16]emphasize that this is not the sole mechanism by
[17]which DNA damage occurs in the cell.
[18]Q. DNA damage such as is purported to be
[19]measured in the Bolognesi paper is happening all the
[20]time, and what's important is whether it gets
[21]repaired or not; fair?
[22]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection to the
[23]characterization.
[24]A. I don't agree with that. I mean, can -- I
[25]mean, to -- to agree with you, you will have to show
  Page 148
[1]me that the folks who -- again, the DNA damage is
[2]going to happen regardless of anything whatsoever.
[3]And, again, I don't -- I'm not qualified to
[4]answer this question. I really have to research it
[5]to better understand whether DNA damage occurs
[6]regardless of any etiologic factors.
[7]I see the paper that you've provided, and I
[8]see the reference. And I think, to some extent,
[9]this is true. You see sometimes the DNA damage and
[10]repair that happens in the cells in the body. But,
[11]in my mind, there's always some additional factors
[12]that are involved. It could be diet, could be
[13]environment, could be drugs, could be anything.
[14]Q. You testified earlier that you looked -- in
[15]addition to the scientific articles that you
[16]reviewed and talked about in your expert report, you
[17]also looked at a number of articles about scientific
[18]articles criticizing IARC or criticizing the EPA and
[19]so on; correct?
[20]A. I said that?
[21]Q. Yes, sir.
[22]A. I said that I looked at scientific articles
[23]as well as the IARC and so forth. That's what I
[24]said.
[25]Q. And you saw criticisms of EPA and their
  Page 149
[1]methodologies?
[2]A. I saw criticism of EPA methodology,
[3]correct.
[4]Q. Things like letters to the editor and press
[5]reports; right?
[6]A. But you said criticism to the IARC and --
[7]Q. Did you not read any criticisms of IARC?
[8]A. I personally have not seen the criticisms
[9]of the IARC but more than happy to look at it, if
[10]you have it.
[11]Q. Okay.
[12]A. I mean, I saw -- I told you I read the IARC
[13]Monograph, which you provided to me, as well as the
[14]actual paper.
[15]Q. In doing your self-directed research, you
[16]found only criticisms by IARC participants of EPA
[17]and EFSA, the European Food Safety --
[18]A. I think you can critique --
[19]Q. -- Agency, and you did not find any
[20]criticisms of IARC; is that right?
[21]A. You can critique every study under the sun.
[22]Every study, you can critique. There is no perfect
[23]study. And we just established, I hope, earlier
[24]that the only perfect study is to take 2,000
[25]patients and randomize them to exposure versus not,
   ?
   r
[0]
  Page 150
[1]which, hopefully, everybody around the table agrees,
[2]is unethical to do.
[3]So there is a criticism for every trial
[4]that we have, for every study that we have. And
[5]because of this, because there's no perfect study, I
[6]have to look into the -- all of the evidence
[7]together and try to come up with a conclusion.
[8]IARC, in my opinion, is more authoritative
[9]in this particular type of studies and in this
[10]particular type of situations than any other agency.
[11]And so I do rely heavily on what the IARC
[12]says, especially when it's published in a very
[13]prestigious peer-review journal.
[14]Could you critique it? I'm sure you can,
[15]but it doesn't take away from the weight of the
[16]evidence.
[17]Q. Let me ask my question again, sir.
[18]A. Please.
[19]Q. In your self-directed research, you came
[20]across multiple criticisms of EPA and EFSA and
[21]others generated by IARC authors, but you did not
[22]come across and read any criticisms of IARC; is that
[23]right?
[24]A. I have not seen that, no.
[25]Q. Okay. Do you know that Dr. Solomon, one of
  Page 151
[1]the coauthors of the Bolognesi 2009 paper that you
[2]quoted in your expert report, was interviewed and
[3]said that IARC got this paper, the Bolognesi 2009
[4]article, totally wrong if they thought that it was
[5]evidence of genotoxicity because it's not?
[6]A. But the IARC looks at all of the evidence.
[7]They don't really look at one paper versus another.
[8]I don't think the IARC's goal -- the IARC has to
[9]look at the collective evidence. They did not take
[10]this paper -- I don't think the IARC -- I don't want
[11]to speak for the IARC. And you can obviously
[12]interview them and -- and they're available. But I
[13]don't think the IARC took this paper and say, okay,
[14]based on the paper by Bolognesi, et al., there is
[15]evidence of genotoxicity.
[16]I believe that they have looked at a
[17]collection of evidence, at a lot of evidence. And
[18]they came up with the conclusion that there is
[19]enough evidence here -- there is plausible evidence
[20]here that genotoxicity exists.
[21]It is not fair to say that they just
[22]reviewed this paper. And, frankly, Dr. Solomon, if
[23]he said that, for him to assume that they relied on
[24]his paper only is a little bit strange because he is
[25]ignoring the evidence of other folks.
  Page 152
[1]But I think these questions should be
[2]directed to IARC. I don't represent IARC.
[3]Q. You think I should go ask IARC and they
[4]should answer my questions?
[5]A. I don't represent IARC. That's for sure.
[6]They can't pay me enough.
[7]MR. GRIFFIS: Let's take a break. What
[8]time is it?

[10]opinion. I do not represent the opinion of
[11]Cardinal Health, my current or previous
[12]employers. So these are my own opinions.
[13]Thanks.
[14]CHADI NABHAN,
[15]resumed and testified as follows:
[16]CONTINUED EXAMINATION
[17]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[18]Q. Sir, have you read the expert report of
[19]plaintiffs' epidemiology expert, Dr. Ritz?
[20]A. I have not.
[21]Q. Okay. In a section of her expert report
[22]where she is discussing epidemiology studies on
[23]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and offering some critiques
[24]on the length of time that passed between initial
[25]exposures and onset of disease, she makes this
   t
   ve .
   .
   y
   .
[1]
   e
   dence.
  Page 154
[1]comment: "Typically, we would generally expect a
[2]five- to ten-year minimum latency between exposure
[3]and disease onset for blood system-related cancers."
[4]She also notes, sir, that in an individual
[5]case it may be a lot shorter; it may be a lot
[6]longer, but talking about the studies.
[7]So the statement, "Typically, we would
[8]generally expect a five- to ten-year minimum latency
[9]between exposure and disease onset for blood
[10]system-related cancers," in your opinion, is that an
[11]accurate statement with regard to non-Hodgkin's
[12]lymphoma?
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to the
[14]paraphrasing. And he's also said he hasn't
[15]reviewed that document.
[16]A. Yeah. I have not reviewed it, but I don't
[17]agree with it. I really do not believe that we
[18]have -- I'd be very curious to know how she formed
[19]this opinion. What level of evidence did she -- I
[20]presume it's a she? You said she?
[21]Q. Yes, sir.
[22]A. I presume there is some evidence that she
[23]used to form this opinion. I don't know what that
[24]is, because latency period, as we talked about, is a
[25]very gray area, and I -- as you just articulated
  Page 155
[1]could be less, could be more.
[2]So I don't know if there is really a
[3]median, and I don't know why would that be different
[4]for hematologic cancers versus solid tumors.
[5]I would say the latency period is a -- is a
[6]very broad category that will really vary based on
[7]each individual case.
[8]Q. How quickly could a toxic exposure produce
[9]a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[10]A. Yeah. I mean, so we did talk about there
[11]are some non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that you may not
[12]find a toxic exposure. You have a clinical case.
[13]You sit with the patient and you talk with the
[14]patient and you go through the entire history, and
[15]you may not find that particular red flag that tells
[16]you that there was something in that patient's
[17]history that led to the development of non-Hodgkin's
[18]lymphoma. And you may find it. I mean, depends on
[19]each history.
[20]If you find that there is a red flag, the
[21]actual period becomes irrelevant because it doesn't
[22]really effect what you do as a clinician. It
[23]doesn't affect management. It doesn't really impact
[24]anything else you would do.
[25]But it would depend, I presume, based on
  Page 156
[1]the actual disease.
[2]I mean, it's unlikely to be that you get
[3]exposed to something today and you get cancer
[4]tomorrow. I mean, we understand the -- you know,
[5]logically, you would have to have some period of
[6]time.
[7]All I'm trying to say is I'm not sure that
[8]we know in oncology what is that minimum versus
[9]maximum in terms of -- because there are so many or
[10]factors. Every patient that smoked that I've taken
[11]care of has said, "Well, my uncle smoked for a
[12]hundred years, and he's never died of cancer." And
[13]it's true, because maybe there are other factors
[14]involved versus somebody who is less lucky.
[15]So I truly don't have an adequate
[16]scientific opinion that I can tell you that there
[17]should be five to ten years. I think if somebody is
[18]claiming this, I would like that claim to be
[19]supported and substantiated by actual evidence. I'd
[20]like to say the reference that she used, because we
[21]can have my opinion that is completely contradicting
[22]to this opinion.
[23]Q. You don't believe that every patient or
[24]even most patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma got
[25]it because of a toxic exposure in their past, do
  Page 157
[1]you?
[2]A. Not every patient gets non-Hodgkin's
[3]lymphoma because of toxic exposure, that's correct.
[4]Q. In fact, the majority probably don't get it
[5]due to a toxic exposure; right?
[6]A. It depends on the occupation. I mean, I
[7]think if I'm studying folks in a particular
[8]occupation or in particular area that they may have
[9]similar occupation, or specific county or state, or
[10]so forth, I probably will find that common
[11]denominator. But if you're talking about the
[12]population, I mean, there is about close to 73,000
[13]new non-Hodgkin's lymphomas designated every year,
[14]at least in '17. The majority, I may not be able to
[15]find that toxic exposure.
[16]Q. You said, "I may not be able to find that
[17]toxic exposure" as if there is one and you just
[18]haven't found it.
[19]A. Well, they may be one not necessarily toxic
[20]exposure. I mean, I think that -- you know, you
[21]don't always find the etiology of a particular
[22]malignancy to diagnose with patients. I mean, you
[23]would love to. As a clinician and as a researcher,
[24]I would like to have the cause of every single
[25]cancer, because if you have the cause, you find the
  Page 158
[1]treatment. And we've demonstrated this, once you
[2]know the actual cause.
[3]What I'm saying is that not in every
[4]clinical case you are able to find that red flag
[5]that tells you aha -- that aha moment -- I think you
[6]developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma because this is
[7]what you do for a living. I don't always have that
[8]in every single case.
[9]Q. And in which occupations do you believe
[10]that a majority of the cases are caused by an
[11]occupational exposure?
[12]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[13]A. I think there's good evidence that farmers
[14]have that. I think there is some good evidence out
[15]there that farmers have higher risk of developing
[16]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as opposed to folks who do
[17]not work in farming.
[18]Q. Any other occupation?
[19]A. I can't recall now, but it's an interesting
[20]question that I've been interested in. I can't
[21]recall right now.
[22]Q. With regard to farmers, there was
[23]epidemiologic evidence suggesting an increased risk
[24]of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before glyphosate was on
[25]the market; right?
  Page 159
[1]A. Yes, there is evidence that farmers do have
[2]increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[3]Q. Separately from the existence of
[4]glyphosate; correct?
[5]A. I'm just trying to recall, because you said
[6]before the market. I'm trying to recall when
[7]that -- that --
[8]MR. LITZENBURG: Do you have epidemiology
[9]published before 1974 or data from that?
[10]A. Yeah. I'm trying to remember when did it
[11]go to market. I'm not remembering that exact.
[12]Q. In the middle of 1974.
[13]A. Yeah. So I did not review epidemiologic
[14]literature before 1974. I think the first paper I
[15]looked at was -- it's somewhere here probably by
[16]Cantor and colleagues -- was '92 paper. But, again,
[17]like we talked about, sometimes you don't have that
[18]time frame.
[19]I think there is good evidence that farmers
[20]have increased risk from an occupational perspective
[21]to developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. How that
[22]relates to when glyphosate was in the market and the
[23]market uptick of that compound -- because once you
[24]go 1974, maybe the market uptick is higher than '84
[25]and '94, you know. So I can't relate those
  Page 160
[1]together.
[2]Q. Okay. So you're not familiar with the
[3]literature on farmers and elevated risk of
[4]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma predating the existence of
[5]glyphosate in the U.S.; correct?
[6]A. I did not review epidemiologic data before
[7]1974, and I said I don't -- I don't know how fast
[8]the market uptick for glyphosate. I'm sure it's
[9]available, but I don't know how fast it got the
[10]uptick.
[11]Q. You said earlier, if I heard you correctly,
[12]that, if you find the cause of a particular case of
[13]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, then you have the treatment?
[14]A. No. You -- no. No.
[15]Q. Maybe I heard --
[16]A. No. I said you at least start thinking,
[17]how can I develop treatment that's directed to the
[18]cause? If you -- if you know that a protein is
[19]mutated -- a gene is mutated that's causing a
[20]particular cancer, then you can develop a particular
[21]therapy against that gene or, you know --
[22]Q. I see.
[23]A. -- et cetera.
[24]Q. But if you know that it was DDT that caused
[25]the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, that doesn't give you
  Page 161
[1]any clues about how to treat it; right?
[2]A. Well, I would eliminate the cause. Right?
[3]It's like smoking. If you know that smoking causes
[4]cancer, you just say stop smoking. So I would stop
[5]using the causative factor. That's the easiest
[6]thing of prevention.
[7]Q. You're not going to cure them, though?
[8]A. Some lymphomas are curable, not all
[9]lymphoma -- I mean, lymphoma, like we say, it's 60
[10]types of lymphomas. In fact, one of the rewarding
[11]things in lymphoma, that we cure some of these
[12]lymphoma. We cure many lymphoma. Depend how you
[13]define "many," but we do cure some lymphoma.
[14]Q. Do you believe that the majority of cases
[15]of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would not have occurred
[16]but for an environmental exposure?
[17]A. I don't believe that. I think that there
[18]are not -- not only environmental exposures cause
[19]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We talked about viral
[20]association. We talked about environmental factors.
[21]And we talked about the fact that we may not
[22]understand completely and fully all of the causation
[23]for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[24]Q. Do you have an opinion as to relative
[25]prevalences of -- of heredity -- i.e., genetic
  Page 162
[1]facts -- versus environmental factors versus just
[2]replicative factors, the ongoing division of cells
[3]and errors that randomly creep into the ongoing
[4]division of cells in the causation of non-Hodgkin's
[5]lymphoma?
[6]A. So I don't know what you mean by heredity,
[7]but what I can say is that there is familial
[8]predisposition. There is data in non-Hodgkin's
[9]lymphoma, like a lot of cancers, not -- not the most
[10]common. But if there is a family history of
[11]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the offspring are at higher
[12]risk of developing lymphoma, like breast cancer and
[13]so forth. So there is such a thing in terms of
[14]familial association.
[15]Now, you have to be careful. Familial
[16]association does not imply or mean that there's a
[17]particular gene that is necessarily mutated or so
[18]forth. These are different things.
[19]So, yes, there is -- you know, family
[20]history is a known risk factor. That's not
[21]modifiable, frankly, except just good history and
[22]physical and good -- good medical care.
[23]The other two areas which were -- that you
[24]asked --
[25]Q. Environmental.
  Page 163
[1]A. Yes. I think there is --
[2]Q. And --
[3]A. Yeah.
[4]Q. And the other is replicative, just the fact
[5]that all of your cells are replicating themselves
[6]all the time and random errors, by biological
[7]definition, creep into in a process and can
[8]ultimately lead to cancer.
[9]A. Yeah, that happens with age. Yeah, I mean,
[10]with age, as we age, the ability of our cells to
[11]repair some of the damage, unfortunately, becomes
[12]less. So, yes. I mean, I think these are the cases
[13]where that's why nobody lives till 200 years. I
[14]mean, at some point something is going to go wrong.
[15]And as we age, these things do happen.
[16]Q. So do you have an opinion with regard to
[17]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as to the relative
[18]prevalences of those three factors:
[19]environmental, hereditary, and replicative --
[20]A. Yeah. I don't think we know the data.
[21]Q. -- in causation?
[22]A. I don't think we know that data. But we
[23]know that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is more of a
[24]disease of the elderly. Median age of diagnosis for
[25]most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are above 60, 65 plus,
  Page 164
[1]actually. There are obviously some subtypes that
[2]you see in the 30s to 40s, et cetera. But I don't
[3]think -- to my knowledge, we don't have a percentage
[4]of how often you see something based on
[5]environmental factors, because to have that data you
[6]would have to eliminate all other factors. And this
[7]is tough to actually know.
[8]Q. It's logical and accurate to think about
[9]the replicative risk as a sort of statistical risk
[10]that's imposed upon you over time. I.e., all the
[11]cells in your body reproduce themselves. By
[12]biological necessity, there are random errors in
[13]their reproduction and some percentage of those
[14]random errors will ultimately lead to cancer.
[15]So everyone is at risk all the time, at
[16]some low level of risk, for all types of cancer,
[17]including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, because of that
[18]biological fact. And that risk increases as the
[19]replications increase and, thus, over time. Is that
[20]fair?
[21]A. I think if you're asking if everybody in
[22]the population at risk for developing cancer at some
[23]point because of this, the answer is yes. I mean,
[24]in fact, the last statistic from the American Cancer
[25]Society is that the lifetime risk of a male in the
  Page 165
[1]U.S. develop cancer is, unfortunately, about close
[2]to 42 percent in a lifetime. So that's huge. In a
[3]female, it's about 43 percent or so. So I think, if
[4]we live long enough, we're going to have a problem.
[5]Q. What is the lifetime risk of non-Hodgkin's
[6]lymphoma?
[7]A. I don't know that. I think it looks
[8]usually -- I think the data that I read from the ACS
[9]was mainly in developing malignancy in general. But
[10]what I can tell you there are -- the last statistics
[11]paper, the number of new cases of non-Hodgkin's
[12]lymphoma in the U.S. was between 72 and 73,000.
[13]It's published by Siegel and colleagues.
[14]Q. On your expert report, page 11, I'd like to
[15]turn to the epidemiological studies. On page 11,
[16]you have a large category header titled "Assessment
[17]of carcinogenic risk in humans," and your first
[18]category is "Epidemiologic studies." Right?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. You say, "Several epidemiological studies
[21]showed statistically significant increased risks
[22]among people exposed to glyphosate." And the first
[23]study that you talk about is by McDuffie, et al.,
[24]from 2001; is that right?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 166
[1]Q. Sir, did you put these studies in any
[2]particular order?
[3]A. I don't remember. I may have tried to put
[4]them in the order of the years that were published.
[5]I think that's what I tried to do. I think
[6]McDuffie's '01. Then you have Hardell '02. DeRoos
[7]'03. I may have tried to do that. I like to do
[8]that chronologically. It's possible that's what I
[9]did.
[10]Q. Okay.
[11]A. But it doesn't mean -- I did not order them
[12]by importance, if that's the question.
[13]Q. Okay.
[14](Nabhan Exhibit 11 marked for
[15]identification.)
[16]Q. I've handed you a copy, sir, of the
[17]McDuffie 2001 paper.
[18]A. Okay.
[19]Q. Now, this was a study of herbicides and
[20]pesticides in general and their association
[21]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; correct?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. It was not focused specifically on
[24]glyphosate; right?
[25]A. It was on -- it was in general, but I think
  Page 167
[1]they had -- I'm trying to see if they subanalyze
[2]glyphosate. I think it was for general exposure, to
[3]my knowledge.
[4]Q. When they are describing the questionnaires
[5]that they sent out on page 1156, second column --
[6]A. Uh-hum.
[7]Q. -- the specific exposures that they talk
[8]about were first major classes, herbicides. I'm at
[9]the end of that first paragraph.
[10]A. Okay.
[11]Q. Chemical groups and the example they give
[12]is phenoxy herbicides and finally to individual
[13]compounds, 2,4-D MCPA, and 2,4,5-T. In their
[14]description of the initial hypotheses, they didn't
[15]specifically mention glyphosate; right?
[16]A. That's correct.
[17]Q. I'm sorry?
[18]A. That's correct, I said.
[19]Q. Yeah, I thought Mr. Litzenburg said
[20]something.
[21]And the authors noted that, because they
[22]were looking at results for multiple chemical agents
[23]and exposures that weren't specifically set out in
[24]the hypothesis, the statistical analyses should be
[25]considered exploratory; right? That's on page 1161,
  Page 168
[1]second column.
[2]A. Yeah. I just saw that they looked at the
[3]glyphosate on page 1158. It shows an odds ratio of
[4]1.26.
[5]Q. Yes, sir. It's mentioned.
[6]A. Right, right. I just -- initially, I said
[7]I didn't -- I didn't know. So 1161?
[8]Q. 1161, second column.
[9]A. Okay.
[10]Q. They say, "We reported results for a number
[11]of chemical agents and exposures, not all of which
[12]were specified in the hypothesis. Therefore, the
[13]statistical analyses related to these unspecified
[14]agents should be considered exploratory. As a
[15]consequence of conducting multiple comparisons, a
[16]small number of statistically significant results
[17]may be attributable to chance."
[18]I read that correctly?
[19]A. You did.
[20]Q. Would you explain to the jury what concept
[21]they're talking about where, when you do statistical
[22]analyses on many different chemicals simultaneously,
[23]you will get potentially, apparently, significant
[24]results only due to chance?
[25]A. I mean, first, I can't speak for the
  Page 169
[1]authors. I only can speculate. I think it's really
[2]fair, if you really want to know what they actually
[3]meant, to direct that question to them.
[4]But what I would say is oftentimes, if you
[5]have a study that is looking at multiple
[6]occupational hazards or occupational exposures,
[7]there are limitations to how much you can control
[8]for these additional occupational hazards in order
[9]for you to tease out the impact of one particular
[10]compound versus another.
[11]So I think they're leaving just some open
[12]room, which is appropriate, to say, okay, well, you
[13]know, these results are important, but they have to
[14]be taken in context. Additional studies are needed,
[15]and there may be some we cannot be 100 percent
[16]conclusive that this is not related to chance. So
[17]that's why we can't really take one study alone and
[18]we have to look at all of these studies that were
[19]done.
[20]Q. For example, sir, if you're using a
[21]95 percent confidence interval and -- confidence
[22]level, rather, and you looked at 20 different
[23]compounds, you would expect to find at least one
[24]statistically significant association solely due to
[25]chance; right?
  Page 170
[1]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[2]A. I'm not sure. I mean, based on what?
[3]Q. That's how the statistics work. 95 percent
[4]is 1 in 20.
[5]A. But why one, not two, why not zero? Where
[6]do you get one from? I mean, I don't know.
[7]Q. An average of one.
[8]A. No, but my point is each study is
[9]different. I mean, I don't think we know. I think
[10]your point is well taken that there are other
[11]factors that contribute. So that's why I think the
[12]authors here, they say some element of this could be
[13]attributable to chance.
[14]I just don't believe that we can generalize
[15]and say, if you take 20 compounds, one or two would
[16]be due to chance. I don't know that. You'd have to
[17]conduct the study and to see what methodology that
[18]you've actually done before you have a general
[19]statement. Otherwise, you can't even review any
[20]epidemiology literature, positive or negative.
[21]Q. Well, sir, if you're doing -- if you're
[22]using a 95 percent confidence level --
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. -- what that means is that a purportedly
[25]statistically significant result is at least 1 in 20
  Page 171
[1]likely due to chance; right?
[2]A. So the P value for statistical significance
[3]is usually less than 5 percent -- less than 0.05,
[4]which means that, as long as you have enough
[5]evidence that 5 percent or less of whatever you are
[6]doing is due to chance, then that's really
[7]clinically important or statistically significant.
[8]So if I have an experiment, 5 percent --
[9]you know, and the P value of this experiment less
[10]than 0.05, then I am admitting that 5 percent could
[11]be due to chance. That's really all you could say.
[12]Q. All right. And 5 percent is 1 in 20?
[13]A. I -- I see what you are saying. Okay. I
[14]guess so.
[15]Q. Okay.
[16]A. Now I understand what you mean.
[17]Q. You say in your expert report, sir, on
[18]page 11, referring to the McDuffie study, "Among
[19]major" -- I'm sorry. I'll wait for you to get
[20]there.
[21]A. I'm good.
[22]Q. "Among major chemical classes of
[23]herbicides, the risk of NHL was statistically
[24]significantly increased among glyphosate-exposed
[25]individuals with an odds ratio of 1.26, 95 percent
  Page 172
[1]confidence interval 0.87 to 1.80, which changed
[2]slightly after adjustment for covariants to an odds
[3]ratio of 1.2, 95 percent confidence interval of 0.83
[4]to 1.74."
[5]Did I read that correctly?
[6]A. You did.
[7]Q. And neither one of those odds ratios is, in
[8]fact, statistically significant; right?
[9]A. I don't know that. I think you just -- you
[10]have to take the odds ratios above 1.
[11]Q. A statistically significant odds ratio is
[12]one where the 95 percent confidence interval does
[13]not cross 1; right?
[14]A. No, no. I understand what you meant, but
[15]I'm just saying it doesn't take away that there was
[16]an increased risk, because we talked about this
[17]earlier that the statistical significance per se is
[18]dependent on the -- on the number of cases, the -- I
[19]mean, that's why certain studies may fail to have
[20]the statistical significance per se because you
[21]don't have enough numbers to show that, but you
[22]can't ignore increased odds ratio when you have an
[23]exposure like this.
[24]A positive study will always -- if you have
[25]enough odds ratio that is above 1, it is something
  Page 173
[1]important to look at. You can't ignore it. The
[2]lack of statistical significance is a completely
[3]different beast because then you look at the -- how
[4]many cases were looked at, how many controls were
[5]looked at, was the study powered enough to actually
[6]detect the statistical insignificance or not.
[7]Q. Sir, you said it was statistically
[8]significantly increased in your expert report;
[9]right?
[10]A. Yes. And what I meant by that was the odds
[11]ratio was above 1.
[12]Q. By the definition of "statistical
[13]significance" used by the McDuffie authors, it
[14]wasn't statistically significant; right?
[15]A. Where do you see that on the McDuffie
[16]paper?
[17]Q. Well, I see it in the confidence interval
[18]that you put in your expert report. I also see it
[19]in Table 2.
[20]A. But you said -- in the McDuffie paper, you
[21]said that they defined -- you have a different
[22]definition.
[23]I mean, again, when I read this paper, I
[24]think the McDuffie paper, they say that we see
[25]increased risk and we really acknowledge that some
  Page 174
[1]of it could be related to chance. So additional
[2]studies are needed.
[3]The conclusion of the authors is hypothesis
[4]generating that there's actually some risk here that
[5]cannot be ignored. And while this study may not be
[6]conclusive, additional studies are actually needed.
[7]Q. Let's look --
[8]A. So I don't see the interpretation that this
[9]was a negative study.
[10]Q. Table 2.
[11]A. Okay.
[12]Q. Under Table 2, "Glyphosate" --
[13]A. Uh-huh.
[14]Q. -- they give two adjusted odds ratio, Odds
[15]Ratio A and Odds Ratio B.
[16]A. Uh-hum.
[17]Q. And they give a 95 percent confidence
[18]interval.
[19]A. I see that.
[20]Q. That's their definition of "statistical
[21]significance" selected in advance for purposes of
[22]this study. And by their definition of "statistical
[23]significance," a 95 percent confidence interval,
[24]neither of these results is statistically
[25]significant; right?
  Page 175
[1]A. Yeah, it may have not reached the P value
[2]of less than 0.05, but I personally would not ignore
[3]an odds ratio of 1.26 or 1.2.
[4]Q. Okay. Let's just start with statistical
[5]significance.
[6]A. If you're --
[7]Q. Do you --
[8]A. -- defining the statistical significance of
[9]less than 0.05, then this was not statistically
[10]significant.
[11]Q. And when an author selects a confidence
[12]interval, that is their definition of statistical
[13]significance for purposes of their paper; right?
[14]A. No, I mean, the -- when an author selects
[15]statistical significance of less than .05, then
[16]after that, they have to decide how many cases they
[17]need to get enough sample size to get to that
[18]threshold. So each case is different. That's why I
[19]was trying to read the methodology, to see how
[20]powered it was.
[21]The 95 percent confidence interval is just
[22]the range that they actually get. So the narrower
[23]the range, the better it is if you can get that.
[24]But it's very difficult to demonstrate in
[25]epidemiologic studies just by the nature of how you
  Page 176
[1]do these studies.
[2]Q. In science, when you're looking at a
[3]particular study, the definition of "statistical
[4]significance," for purposes of that study, is the
[5]confidence level that was selected in advance by the
[6]authors, here, 95 percent; right?
[7]A. But let me just explain. I mean,
[8]statistical significance -- significance is a
[9]completely arbitrary chosen thing that's less than
[10].005. So -- so if I have -- if -- I'm just saying,
[11]if I have -- if I have a P value of 0.06, I have to
[12]look at the trend, right. I mean, I have to look --
[13]does it mean that only -- I will take only the 0.05
[14]and ignore everything else? Because sometimes you
[15]have two patients -- just two patients that
[16]completely change the curve.
[17]So as a clinician-researcher, you -- you
[18]look at this and you say, Okay, I mean, I get this.
[19]Let me look at additional data. Let me look at
[20]additional information to solidify the opinion.
[21]At some point, statisticians and
[22]researchers have to agree on what is that point that
[23]we are allowing chance to play a factor, and they
[24]agreed on 5 percent. They could have done
[25]4 percent. They could have done 6 percent. But
  Page 177
[1]that is why it's very -- it's a double-edged sword.
[2]We have to make sure that we put everything in
[3]context.
[4]You can't -- you can't ignore a study that
[5]showed a P value of 0.06 and say it's not
[6]statistically significant, and you can't agree on
[7]every study that was significant. I mean, that's
[8]why, as clinicians, we have to interpret the
[9]evidence.
[10]MR. LITZENBURG: Hang on for a second
[11]before we ask any more questions. It sounds
[12]like there's still hold music on the line for
[13]everybody dialing in. Can we figure that out?
[14]MS. SALEK: Oh, really? Do you want to go
[15]off the record? I can dial in.
[16]MR. GRIFFIS: Okay.
[17]MR. LITZENBURG: Anybody on the line can
[18]hear us?
[19]VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record at
[20]1:11 P.M.
[21](Recess taken from 1:11 P.M. to
[22]1:15 P.M.)
[23]VIDEOGRAPHER: And beginning Disc No. 3 of
[24]the deposition of Dr. Chadi Nabhan. We're back
[25]on the record at 1:15 P.M.
  Page 178
[1]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[2]Q. Okay. Dr. Nabhan, you were just giving us
[3]a critique of statistical significance as applied to
[4]causation.
[5]What I'm focused on right now is your
[6]expert report and your claim in your expert report
[7]that the odds ratios reported in Table 2 of the
[8]McDuffie paper were statistically significant.
[9]A. What I meant by this is that the odds ratio
[10]were more than 1. I did not imply that the P value
[11]was less than 0.05.
[12]Q. So when you say "statistically
[13]significant," what you mean is an odds ratio of
[14]greater than 1?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. Does anyone else mean that when they say
[17]"statistically significant"?
[18]A. I can only speak for myself.
[19]Q. You said that scientists, epidemiologists,
[20]I presume, oncologists, have settled on the
[21]convention of a P value of .05 for statistical
[22]significance.
[23]Why have they done so?
[24]A. They had to have a point to agree on. They
[25]accepted that 5 percent chance is okay. There are
  Page 179
[1]many studies that were statistically significant
[2]that they had no clinically meaningful outcome in
[3]cancer therapies. Just you have to agree on
[4]something to standardize things.
[5]Similar to the paper that you showed me
[6]into standardizing genotoxicity assays, at some
[7]point, the field has to agree that, if we're going
[8]to assess genotoxicity, these are the ten things
[9]we're going to do. So it's just standardized things
[10]so at least you compare apples to apples.
[11]But you can't -- as a clinician, I can show
[12]you many papers that showed a P value of less than
[13]0.05 that meant nothing, that showed an improvement
[14]in treatment of 1.5 weeks. Does this mean how
[15]clinically meaningful it was? It was great paper.
[16]It was New England Journal of Medicine paper,
[17]P value less than 0.05. It was in pancreas cancer,
[18]but the actual difference between the actual
[19]treatment and control was 1.5 weeks.
[20]So we can argue as scientists all we want.
[21]We ultimately have to look at the totality of
[22]evidence. And a P value of less than 0.05 is very
[23]important, but it's not the only thing that we look
[24]at.
[25]Q. And it's one of the things that the field
  Page 180
[1]has settled on as part of the scientific discourse
[2]on causation; correct?
[3]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection. Asked and
[4]answered.
[5]A. Again -- I mean, again, it is one of the --
[6]you can't -- you can't just be blindsided only and
[7]say I will only look at literature that has a
[8]P value of 0.05. I mean, it is -- you would -- you
[9]would be at fault to doing this.
[10]I think that, if you design a study based
[11]on the goal of the trial or the study that you are
[12]trying to do, if your goal is to demonstrate
[13]statistical significance, then you want to power
[14]that study to have a P value of less than 0.05.
[15]And I can assure you, by the way, if you
[16]have enough patients in any study, every study would
[17]be statistically significant. If you take 20,000
[18]patients, eventually you would get a P value of less
[19]than 0.05, but it's not practical. So that's why
[20]you look at other things such as odds ratio, risk
[21]ratio, and so forth.
[22]Q. Were the adjusted odds ratios in Table 2
[23]adjusted for other pesticides?
[24]A. So I think it has a footnote of D. It
[25]says, "Glyphosate is the only phosphonic acid
  Page 181
[1]herbicide reported by more than 1 percent of
[2]responders. Roundup, Touchdown, Vector, Wrangler,
[3]Laredo do not include dicamba. And Rustler is
[4]mixture of dicamba and glyphosate."
[5]I -- I presume B adjusted for statistically
[6]significant medical variables. So they adjusted for
[7]history of measles, mumps, cancer, allergy,
[8]desensitization shots, and a positive family history
[9]of cancer in first-degree relatives. These are the
[10]things that they adjusted for.
[11]Q. They did not adjust for exposure to other
[12]pesticides?
[13]A. No. It says -- they did not mention that
[14]here.
[15]Q. Do you agree with me that negative data
[16]pretty much never makes it to the major journals?
[17]A. No. I would say that people are always
[18]biased to publish positive data because they get
[19]that to more higher-impact journals and because it
[20]gets more press, but journals now are becoming
[21]increasingly interested in having negative data
[22]because they could be as important and as powerful
[23]as positive data.
[24]But, in general, people are -- always like
[25]to report positive data, that it was a positive
  Page 182
[1]trial, positive association, just an inherent bias.
[2]Q. It's called publication bias; right?
[3]A. Yeah, it is a publication bias.
[4]Q. And publication --
[5]A. Sometimes you can have a negative study
[6]that is sitting in your drawer that you decide never
[7]to publish it because you have more pressing needs.
[8]You publish your positive trial. You spend more
[9]time on it as opposed to publishing a negative study
[10]because you know, if you publish a positive study
[11]you are going to get a better journal, maybe get a
[12]grant, maybe get -- I mean, it's just the way it is.
[13]Q. The -- because of publication bias, you're
[14]more likely to see, in the published literature,
[15]positive than negative results; right?
[16]A. I think you have -- you'll see more
[17]positive literature published, but I think the main
[18]difference -- honestly, what I have seen lately is
[19]that the negative studies, they still get published,
[20]but they publish -- they are published in
[21]lower-impact journals. They still have a role.
[22]But, to your point, some negative studies will never
[23]be published because people will never get to them.
[24]Q. And the positive ones -- the negative ones
[25]never make it to the major journals?
  Page 183
[1]A. Not all of them. I mean, some of them will
[2]still make it. It's just not -- you know, not the
[3]same power. But as I said, a lot of trials --
[4]negative trials now are making it to the -- to
[5]the -- to our major journals.
[6]You know, a recent paper in the Journal of
[7]Clinical Oncology showed the lack of association of
[8]androgen-deprivation therapy and dementia in men.
[9]So that's -- it's a negative study. They didn't
[10]show positive association, et cetera.
[11]So I think you are seeing this. But it's
[12]always the case, if you are the author and you have
[13]one negative trial and one positive trial, you're
[14]going to try to get the positive one out because it
[15]might allow you to advance academically more. It's
[16]just the world that we live in.
[17]Q. I'm showing you a tweet you wrote.
[18]A. Oh, I like that.
[19]Q. "Negative data never make it to major
[20]journals" --
[21]A. Are you following me on Twitter?
[22]Q. -- "this would be big news."
[23]A. Yes. Negative data never make it to
[24]major -- this is published still. So this is
[25]actually my point. This paper is published. It's a
  Page 184
[1]lower-impact journal, "Clinical lymphoma, Myeloma &
[2]Leukemia" -- and Myeloma.
[3]So if this was a positive study, I think
[4]this particular paper would have made it in a much
[5]higher-impact journal. It actually solidifies what
[6]I just said.
[7]Q. The tendency of the published literature --
[8]A. Is this -- do I leave this?
[9]Q. -- to reflect positive results and to
[10]under-reflect negative results, that's called in
[11]science "publication bias." Right?
[12]A. Yeah, I mean, I think I said that a few
[13]times. I'll say it one more time. Negative trials
[14]or negative data will still make it to journals, but
[15]it may not be the higher-impact journal.
[16]And, in fact, this is, again, a lot of the
[17]things that we always debate. You know, this is an
[18]example of how negative data gets published, but the
[19]impact factor of the journal that it gets published
[20]in is very different.
[21]You take the same exact data. And, if it's
[22]positive, all of the sudden, this would be in a
[23]major journal. It's just the way it is. This is
[24]how the academic world works.
[25]Q. The Bradford Hill criteria that you
  Page 185
[1]applied, sir, did you go back and read his original
[2]paper?
[3]A. Not the actual paper, actually. I read all
[4]of the criteria online. It wasn't the original
[5]paper that he -- the 1965 paper, but it was
[6]referenced in a lot of other publications I was able
[7]to get to.
[8]Q. And you know that, in the original paper,
[9]he said that, before you apply the criteria, you
[10]should have your observations reveal an association
[11]between two variables perfectly clear-cut and beyond
[12]what we would care to attribute to the play of
[13]chance?
[14]MR. LITZENBURG: Objection to the
[15]characterization.
[16]A. So I think -- I'm not aware of that.
[17]That's the short answer. But I think it's criteria,
[18]it's guidelines. We've talked about this before.
[19]You can't take it in absolute terms.
[20]All of these guidelines that we establish
[21]and that we actually bring out outside, they are not
[22]meant to eliminate or exclude your clinical
[23]judgment. At least I'm hoping not to.
[24]Q. Is it your opinion, sir, that you have
[25]observed, in the epidemiological data, an
  Page 186
[1]association perfectly clear-cut and beyond what you
[2]would care to attribute to the play of chance?
[3]A. There is sufficient evidence that I
[4]reviewed that demonstrates an association and
[5]causality that are both not related to chance.
[6]Q. So is the answer yes, you believe that
[7]Sir Bradford Hill's criteria were met?
[8]A. I believe that the Bradford Hill criteria
[9]were -- were met.
[10]Q. And I mean the criteria for starting to use
[11]the procedure, i.e., I have observed an association
[12]between two variables, perfectly clear-cut and
[13]beyond what we would care to attribute to the play
[14]of chance?
[15]A. So what do you mean by "perfectly
[16]clear-cut"? Like, what is that? That's such a
[17]vague term.
[18]Q. What is it to you?
[19]A. It means that there's zero doubt. And
[20]there is no such a thing as zero doubt in science,
[21]in epidemiology. I mean, when you say "clear-cut,"
[22]it means that you're leaving zero room for the
[23]possibility of chance, and I think we all agree that
[24]this thing doesn't exist in science.
[25]It's just impossible to demonstrate unless
  Page 187
[1]you do this prospective, randomized trial that we
[2]all agreed on that it's unethical to do. So you
[3]look at the criteria, and you try to apply the
[4]information that you reviewed in the criteria. And
[5]there's enough evidence out there to suggest that
[6]this is the case.
[7]But "clear-cut" means that there's --
[8]you've got zero doubt. And, I mean, I don't think
[9]anybody can say that.
[10]Q. You think that's what Bradford Hill meant,
[11]before you apply my criteria --
[12]A. Well, you said "clear-cut." I asked you
[13]what clear-cut is. You punted the question to me,
[14]and I told you clear-cut, to me, means zero doubt.
[15]That's what it means to me. So now it's your turn.
[16]What does it mean to you?
[17]Q. Well, Sir Bradford Hill was setting out
[18]criteria to apply to a possible statistical
[19]association between two variables to assess whether
[20]they're causal or not?
[21]A. Okay.
[22]Q. He said clear-cut --
[23]A. Okay.
[24]Q. -- and beyond the play of chance.
[25]And do you think that he meant 100 percent
  Page 188
[1]proven before you even start doing his causality
[2]analysis?
[3]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[4]A. I hope not. I don't believe that's what he
[5]meant, because I think he would probably know better
[6]that there is no such a thing as clear-cut. So I
[7]don't believe this is what he meant.
[8]I think what he meant is that there is
[9]enough evidence out there to prove the association
[10]and causality between two variables. I mean,
[11]"clear-cut," again, it's a vague term. To some
[12]people, it means 100 percent certainty; others,
[13]90 percent; and others, 50.1 percent. So I don't
[14]know what he meant by this.
[15]Q. And do you know that most epidemiologists
[16]consider it to be a statistically significant
[17]association in a reliable study?
[18]MR. LITZENBURG: I object to that
[19]characterization.
[20]A. The Bradford Hill?
[21]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[22]Q. Yes.
[23]A. I know that they used the Bradford Hill
[24]criteria to the extent possible, but I also know it
[25]is not used in absolute terms. I mean, you can't --
  Page 189
[1]again, you try -- you have to have certain --
[2]certain criteria or certain guidelines in order to
[3]compare apples to apples, but I don't believe any
[4]epidemiologist is going to tell you that we use this
[5]exclusively and with 100 percent certainty.
[6]Q. The next statistic that you quote in your
[7]expert report from the McDuffie paper is an odds
[8]ratio, which you called statistically significant at
[9]2.12, 1.2 to 3.73 confidence interval.
[10]And that comes from Table 8 of the
[11]McDuffie paper, sir. Would you take a look at
[12]that.
[13]A. I see Table 8.
[14]Q. When we were looking at the not
[15]statistically significant association on Table 2,
[16]you looked for me and saw that the odds ratio that
[17]was reported there had been adjusted for various
[18]statistically significant medical variables and with
[19]the variables of age and province of residence;
[20]correct?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And here they did not adjust for even the
[23]medical variables; right?
[24]A. I'm not sure that's accurate. If they have
[25]adjusted on the other one, they have adjusted for
  Page 190
[1]this one.
[2]Q. In Table 2?
[3]A. Yeah. I see what Table 2 you said.
[4]Q. In Table 2, Odds Ratio A was adjusted for
[5]age and province of residence, and B was also
[6]adjusted for statistically significant medical
[7]variables; right?
[8]A. Right.
[9]Q. That was the meaning of Table B?
[10]A. In Table 8, they adjusted to the variables
[11]age and province of residence, that's correct. And
[12]in Table 2, they've adjusted for additional -- we
[13]talked about this, I think -- yeah, measles, mumps,
[14]cancer, et cetera.
[15]Q. And in Table 8, they only give out the
[16]Ratio A; right?
[17]A. That's what it says, yes.
[18]Q. So they didn't give B, adjusting for the
[19]medical variables?
[20]A. They didn't -- well, they did not
[21]address -- even in Table 2, they did not look at all
[22]medical variables. All that they looked at
[23]specifically are, to be clear, measles, mumps,
[24]cancer, allergy desensitization shots, and a
[25]positive family history of cancer in first-degree
  Page 191
[1]relatives.
[2]Q. So there were other --
[3]A. This --
[4]Q. Sorry.
[5]A. Right. I mean, this is what they looked
[6]at. So they did not look at tobacco, alcohol,
[7]hypertension, diabetes.
[8]There are other -- when you say "medical
[9]variables," there is a presumption or you're
[10]implying that they looked at all medical factors.
[11]And they did not. They actually say exactly what
[12]they looked at.
[13]In Table 8, they specifically looked at age
[14]and province of residence.
[15]Q. Okay. So they didn't make the same
[16]adjustment --
[17]A. No.
[18]Q. -- even that they made -- even the partial
[19]adjustment that you just described that they made in
[20]Table 2, and in neither table did they adjust for
[21]exposure to other pesticides; correct?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. So in McDuffie we have no statistically
[24]significant association adjusted for other
[25]pesticides; right?
  Page 192
[1]A. For other pesticides, I did not see that.
[2]Q. Now, the definition of -- the frequency of
[3]exposure definition here was the number of days per
[4]year that glyphosate was used; correct?
[5]A. Yes. I think it's more versus less than
[6]two days or something like that.
[7]Q. So if somebody used glyphosate twice a year
[8]for ten years, they would be in the low exposure
[9]group?
[10]A. Say again. I'm sorry.
[11]Q. In someone used glyphosate twice a year for
[12]ten years on two different days over the course of a
[13]year for ten years, they'd be in the low exposure
[14]group, and someone who used it on fifth -- on three
[15]consecutive days or three different days in the same
[16]calendar year would be in the high group, even
[17]though their total exposures would be flipped;
[18]right?
[19]A. I have to write down what you're saying.
[20]Q. Yes, sir. Twice a year for 10 years; 20
[21]exposures.
[22]A. Okay.
[23]Q. That would be in the low group.
[24]A. And you say on the low group based on what?
[25]Q. Based on the definition of the low group,
  Page 193
[1]days per year.
[2]A. Do you mind telling me where you read that
[3]in that paper?
[4]Q. Greater than zero and less than or equal to
[5]2. It's in the days per year column on Table 8,
[6]among other places.
[7]A. Oh, Table 8. I see. I'm reading in the
[8]methods.
[9]So they say here, "Each subject will report
[10]ten hour per year or more of exposure to pesticides
[11]as defined by the screening questions, and a
[12]15 percent random sample of the remainder was mailed
[13]a list of pesticides in an information letter." And
[14]then they did a phone interview with them after
[15]that.
[16]And then the pathology, I think, had -- was
[17]since re-reviewed, which is a very -- which is a
[18]very strong thing about -- when you're able to do a
[19]pathologic review.
[20]Okay. So Table 8.
[21]Q. Table 8?
[22]A. Uh-hum.
[23]Q. Two groups, the low exposed group, greater
[24]than zero or less than or equal to 2?
[25]A. I see that.
  Page 194
[1]Q. And greater than 2; right?
[2]A. I see that.
[3]Q. So if you had -- and that is days per year;
[4]right?
[5]A. Two days per year. That is correct.
[6]Q. So two days per year for 10 years, that's
[7]20 exposures.
[8]A. Uh-huh.
[9]Q. And someone else who has three days in the
[10]same year and no other exposures whatsoever, three
[11]total exposures would be in the high exposure group;
[12]right?
[13]A. But if you have a three days per year for
[14]one year, that's three.
[15]Q. Yes.
[16]A. Yeah. So it would be --
[17]Q. It would be in the high exposure group?
[18]A. That is correct.
[19]Q. Despite having three lifetime exposures as
[20]compared to someone in the low exposure group with
[21]20 lifetime exposures?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Much more exposure; right?
[24]A. Yeah.
[25]Q. So people's exposure could be reversed in
  Page 195
[1]the study and the statistics could be reversed;
[2]right?
[3]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[4]A. I mean, the authors of this paper, this is
[5]how they defined exposure. And, again, I mean, when
[6]you write these papers you'll have to -- you'll have
[7]to decide how you define exposure in order for you
[8]to make any sense of the data you are accumulating.
[9]So they have chosen to look at more -- you
[10]know, anything that's less than two days as low
[11]exposure versus unexposed, anything more than two
[12]days per year as high exposure. This is the
[13]definition that they used.
[14]I -- you know, again, please recall that
[15]this paper was gone through peer-review process.
[16]It's published, so I think if the reviewers had any
[17]issues with the actual definition and if they found
[18]that the definition is inaccurate or inappropriate,
[19]it would have been -- there would have been issues
[20]to get published.
[21]So this is the definition of the authors.
[22]So we'll have to take that based on what they say.
[23]Q. You agree it's a limitation of the study,
[24]potentially?
[25]A. I think there is a limitation for any
  Page 196
[1]study. As I've told you, I can find limitation in
[2]every single study. There is no perfect study.
[3]Q. And the failure to control for other
[4]pesticides is also a limitation in this study?
[5]A. It's one of the limitations, yes. It is
[6]literally impossible to control in everything in
[7]epidemiology study because you don't have a
[8]controlled environment for these patients.
[9]Q. Do you know if it would have been possible
[10]to apply a statistical test to control for exposure
[11]to other pesticides in this study?
[12]A. I think you'd have to -- you'll have to
[13]rely on what the cases and controls are remembering
[14]in terms of what additional pesticides they were
[15]exposed to and so forth.
[16]Q. So their pesticide exposures were
[17]collected. That information was collected; right?
[18]A. Yeah. I mean, they did say that here in
[19]the methods that they asked questions about other
[20]pesticides and so forth, but they -- for some
[21]reason, they were unable to control for it. This is
[22]not unusual that you're not able to control for it.
[23]I don't know why exactly they weren't able to
[24]control for it.
[25]Q. Do you know if they were unable or if they
  Page 197
[1]just didn't?
[2]A. I am certain that one of the peers that
[3]reviewed the paper must have raised this issue and
[4]they probably got a convincing answer. I don't know
[5]why. Nor do I believe it's my role to understand
[6]why they didn't do it. I have to take the evidence
[7]as is.
[8]Q. The Hardell study is the next one that you
[9]talked about in your expert report, sir.
[10](Nabhan Exhibit 12 marked for
[11]identification.)
[12]A. Okay.
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: You didn't mark that
[14]tweet, or did you? Is this 12 or 13?
[15]MR. GRIFFIS: I didn't mark it.
[16]Q. And this is another study like McDuffie
[17]where data was gathered for a large group of
[18]herbicides and pesticides and other chemicals at
[19]once; right?
[20]A. Yeah. Well, this one they actually went
[21]back and they looked at two older studies. One was
[22]published by Nordstrom, and the other was published
[23]by -- by Hardell. I think '98 and '99. And one of
[24]them was related to hairy cell leukemia, which is a
[25]low-grade type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the
  Page 198
[1]other was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[2]So they tried -- basically, they pulled the
[3]data of both studies together. And they wanted to
[4]see if we pull the data altogether at the same time,
[5]would be able -- would we be able to find a more
[6]statistically meaningful information.
[7]So they're trying to increase the power of
[8]their analysis by increasing the number of patients
[9]analyzed.
[10]Q. There were only eight people with
[11]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma exposed to glyphosate out of
[12]404 total cases in these two studies; right?
[13]A. Which table is that?
[14]Q. Table 1.
[15]A. I'm trying to see where the eight is. So
[16]you have glyphosate, four cases and three control.
[17]Is that what you're looking at?
[18]Q. I'm looking at Table 1.
[19]A. I am looking at Table 1 too. Do you want
[20]to direct me what to look at in Table 1?
[21]MR. LITZENBURG: Are you representing this
[22]to be Hardell 2002?
[23]THE WITNESS: This is 1998.
[24]MR. LITZENBURG: Yeah. I mean, we are
[25]looking at the different one.
  Page 199
[1]THE WITNESS: This is not the paper I'm
[2]referencing.
[3]MR. LITZENBURG: Did you mean to give it to
[4]us?
[5]THE WITNESS: This is the older paper that
[6]we --
[7]MR. GRIFFIS: Can I see?
[8]THE WITNESS: This is -- what I said this
[9]is the older one that they pulled --
[10]MR. GRIFFIS: Yeah, you are right. I've
[11]got -- I've got the right one here.
[12]THE WITNESS: Thank you.
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: Thank you.
[14]Q. Okay.
[15]A. Yeah. This is the one, the 2002.
[16]Q. Yes, sir.
[17]So Table 1 in this one, then.
[18]A. Okay. So Table 1, you have number of
[19]cases -- just tell me what to look at. So I mean --
[20]Q. There were only eight people with
[21]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma exposed to glyphosate out of
[22]404 total cases; right?
[23]A. Oh, I see. The eight. Yes, I see that
[24]now.
[25]Q. Okay.
  Page 200
[1]A. Okay.
[2]Q. And that's certainly a low number of cases
[3]for an epidemiology study on cancer; right?
[4]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[5]A. It's not a high number, but it's not a
[6]number that we would ignore, because then you have
[7]to look at population basis.
[8]Q. And Hardell did a multi-varied analysis to
[9]adjust for confounders; right?
[10]A. Yes, he did. You adjusted for age, county,
[11]study site, and vital status.
[12]Q. Do you know what vital status is?
[13]A. Death versus alive, I presume.
[14]Q. And Table 7 shows the odds ratio calculated
[15]with multi-varied analysis with the correction for
[16]those confounding factors; right?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. And the result given there is not
[19]statistically significant; right?
[20]A. I think because the lower portion of the
[21]95 percent confidence interval is below 1, if that's
[22]what you mean.
[23]Q. Yes.
[24]A. Then it's not statistically significant.
[25]But, as we discussed earlier, the odds ratio is --
  Page 201
[1]in my opinion, is very important. You can't ignore
[2]it.
[3]Q. Yes, sir.
[4]You believe that odds ratios above 1 are
[5]important regardless of whether --
[6]A. I think it's important --
[7]Q. -- they are measured to be statistically
[8]significant; is that fair?
[9]A. I would -- I would say I would not dismiss
[10]an odds ratio that's above 1 without understanding
[11]why, and without looking at additional evidence to
[12]know where things are going.
[13]Q. There was no adjustment made for exposure
[14]to other pesticides; right?
[15]A. Based on my review, I don't think they
[16]adjusted for other pesticides. And I think that's
[17]always a limitation because it is difficult to
[18]adjust for.
[19]Q. And they said that exposure to different
[20]types of pesticides did correlate in this study;
[21]right? So it would be a confounding factor. That's
[22]on 1047, first column, three paragraphs down.
[23]A. "In the multi-varied analysis exposure to
[24]herbicides, fungicides increased the risk, although
[25]odds ratio was lower than in the uni-varied
  Page 202
[1]analysis."
[2]So your question is?
[3]Q. The results in multi-varied analysis must
[4]be interpreted with caution since exposure to
[5]different types of pesticides correlate. They found
[6]there was correlation between --
[7]A. Yeah.
[8]Q. -- different types of pesticides?
[9]A. Of course.
[10]Q. And, therefore, there would be confounding;
[11]right?
[12]A. I think it's -- like I said, you always to
[13]want try to control for confounding factors if you
[14]can. And there are a variety of reasons why they
[15]could or can't: number of cases, the belief in
[16]the recall, et cetera. So it's not really clear why
[17]sometimes they're not able to.
[18]Q. In McDuffie and Hardell, you don't know
[19]if the odds ratios would even be above 1.0 if
[20]controlled for other pesticides; right?
[21]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[22]A. I don't know that. It was not -- it was
[23]not done.
[24]But you have to remember that sometimes
[25]when you control for additional confounding factors,
  Page 203
[1]the odds ratios actually go down. So the fact that
[2]you have odds ratios that's above 1 without
[3]controlling is very important. And that's why we
[4]can't ignore it, because once you control to --
[5]to -- again, the fact that you see -- you see
[6]certain things with control, without control doesn't
[7]take away from the evidence, in my opinion.
[8]Q. Did you just say, sir, that a failure to
[9]control for a factor known to be confounding does
[10]not take away from the quality of the evidence?
[11]A. Yeah. If you're -- because you can't
[12]always control. That's really the major issue. I
[13]think, as we said earlier this morning, if you are
[14]able, when you design the study, to control for all
[15]variables to the extent possible, you will always
[16]try to do that. But there are a variety of reasons
[17]why you can't do it.
[18]I think everybody acknowledges that you
[19]would like to do it if you can. I don't know why
[20]some studies can, some studies can't. I believe a
[21]lot is related to the numbers that they have, where
[22]they don't believe they have enough numbers to
[23]control for all the variables included.
[24]Q. Low numbers yield less useful numbers
[25]across the board; right?
  Page 204
[1]A. It makes it more difficult to control. If
[2]you have higher numbers, it's much easier to control
[3]for variables; but when you have low numbers, you
[4]have very little to work with to control for
[5]variables.
[6]Q. And your statistics are less well
[7]controlled as well; right?
[8]A. It becomes more difficult to show
[9]statistical significance.
[10]Q. And it's also more likely that statistical
[11]findings that you think you have found don't hold
[12]up; correct?
[13]A. Well, you can't tell that unless you do the
[14]actual control. I mean, I think it is possible that
[15]they won't hold up, but it's possible they would.
[16]Q. All I'm asking in general, sir, if you do a
[17]small study in just a few people, you're more likely
[18]to get false negatives and false positives and
[19]falseness in every direction.
[20]A. Of course.
[21]Q. Correct?
[22]A. Of course.
[23]Q. And the more cases and controls that you
[24]can find, the more reliable your data gets in every
[25]way; right?
  Page 205
[1]A. The more numbers you have, you will always
[2]have better more robust data.
[3]Q. Okay. We have looked at McDuffie and
[4]Hardell, and now I'm turning to DeRoos 2003, the
[5]next epidemiology study discussed in your expert
[6]report, sir.
[7](Nabhan Exhibit 13 marked for
[8]identification.)
[9]Q. And just like the last study, Hardell, that
[10]we looked at, is actually pooling two smaller
[11]earlier studies. This also pooled three small
[12]earlier studies; right?
[13]A. This -- let me just make sure I know --
[14]this is the '03 paper?
[15]Q. Yes, sir.
[16]A. Okay. I was -- so it says March '08 up
[17]there, so I was confused.
[18]Sure. Go ahead.
[19]Q. Okay. So this pooled three earlier small
[20]studies; right?
[21]A. Yes. From Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and
[22]Kansas.
[23]Q. It pooled the Cantor study from Iowa and
[24]Minnesota, the Zahm study from Nebraska, and the
[25]Hoar study from Kansas; correct?
  Page 206
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And, again, these were studies that were
[3]looking at multiple pesticides and herbicides
[4]simultaneously; right?
[5]A. It did.
[6]Q. So like the others, you'd expect some false
[7]positives; right?
[8]A. It's possible.
[9]Q. The Cantor -- we just looked at a study --
[10]the Hardell study with eight cases in it. The
[11]Cantor study had 26 cases, sir.
[12]A. The Cantor study was mainly for farmers in
[13]farming population. I don't think this specifically
[14]looked at glyphosate.
[15]Q. And -- right. And Dr. Neugut testified
[16]that it had low power, the Cantor study had low
[17]power, because there were only 26 cases of
[18]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with exposure to glyphosate.
[19]Do you agree that that many cases with
[20]exposure to -- with exposure is a low-powered study?
[21]A. I think you have to look at the
[22]denominator, 26 out of how many, to accurately see
[23]how powerful the study was.
[24]Q. Okay. Do you want to see the Cantor study?
[25]A. Sure.
  Page 207
[1](Nabhan Exhibit 14 marked for
[2]identification.)
[3]Q. Did you look at these individual
[4]substudies, sir?
[5]A. Yes, I did. But there's a lot of
[6]information in each one. Difficult to remember
[7]everything.
[8]This is a '92 paper. Yeah.
[9]So they had 195 patients with follicular
[10]lymphoma, 198 with diffused, and 85 of small
[11]lymphocytic, and 144 of other. So this is the
[12]number of lymphoma cases that they had. They had
[13]622 cases and 1,245 controls.
[14]Q. And Table 6, sir, you can see how many were
[15]exposed to glyphosate, and the answer is 26; right?
[16]A. Yes. But I think it's important -- that's
[17]what I meant by the denominator. I think it's a
[18]very respectable number, 622 cases and 1,245
[19]controlled. That's the denominator, which is very
[20]important.
[21]And then you look at Table 6, as you said.
[22]And in glyphosate, the number of cases were 26
[23]versus 49. So I -- you know, I think that's -- you
[24]know, 26 out of 622. I mean, the total number of
[25]exposure is 26 plus 49.
  Page 208
[1]Q. Well, do you agree or disagree with
[2]Dr. Neugut that the Cantor study has low power
[3]because of the numbers of people exposed to
[4]glyphosate?
[5]A. I don't agree.
[6]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to that
[7]characterization.
[8]A. I don't think you can use the absolute
[9]numbers by themselves as the sole determination of a
[10]low versus high power. Many times you actually
[11]decide on the power of the study before you even
[12]embark on the study, not after the fact.
[13]Q. In the DeRoos paper, sir, DeRoos 2003 --
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. -- he gives results for a logistic and a
[16]hierarchical regression analysis; right?
[17]A. Which -- which table are you looking at?
[18]Q. I'm actually looking at the statistical
[19]analyses section on page 2.
[20]A. Okay. Sure.
[21]Q. In that -- in the middle of the first
[22]paragraph under "Statistical analyses" on page 2 of
[23]the DeRoos 2003 paper, he said, "We employed two
[24]approaches to our analyses, standard logistical
[25]regression and hierarchical regression, calculating
  Page 209
[1]odds ratios to estimate the relevant risk associated
[2]with each pesticide." Right?
[3]A. I'm not familiar with all the statistical
[4]methodology. I'm not a statistician. You know, I
[5]think that is a very -- that's delving into the
[6]statistical detail, which I'm not really qualified
[7]to answer.
[8]Q. Okay. Well, you see that that's --
[9]A. I see what you're saying. I do see it.
[10]Q. I'll try not to get too technical about it.
[11]In the hierarchical regression of multiple
[12]pesticide exposures, the next paragraph, they say
[13]that in the hierarchical regression analysis, they
[14]regressed NHL disease status on the 46 pesticides
[15]exposure.
[16]So they did some controlling for pesticide
[17]exposures in the hierarchical, not the logistic,
[18]regression analysis; right?
[19]A. I really think you're delving into so much
[20]detail, that I'm struggling here to follow you.
[21]I -- whatever -- I mean, they've done a lot of
[22]statistical analysis, I guess. That's all I can
[23]say.
[24]Q. Can you tell if they controlled for
[25]pesticide exposure in the logistic regression?
  Page 210
[1]A. If they controlled for other pesticide
[2]exposures?
[3]Q. Yes.
[4]A. So I have in my notes here that they did
[5]control for confounders. So, obviously, I've looked
[6]and saw that they controlled for confounders. And
[7]I'll have to see if they -- I believe they actually
[8]tried to control for other pesticides.
[9]Q. In the hierarchical section; right?
[10]A. Because there were 47 pesticides out of --
[11]that's what I wrote here in my notes, but I don't
[12]know the methodology of how they controlled. Maybe
[13]this is statistical way of controlling. My notes
[14]suggest that they have -- they did control for other
[15]pesticides.
[16]Q. Yes, sir.
[17]In the hierarchal regression they did;
[18]right?
[19]A. Okay. I guess in the hierarchal
[20]regression.
[21]Q. Okay. And the odds ratio that you reported
[22]in your expert report comes from the logistic
[23]regression on Table 3; true?
[24]A. 2.1. Let me check. 2.1, that is from the
[25]logistic regression, that's correct.
  Page 211
[1]Q. And the odds ratio reported from the
[2]hierarchical regression 1.6, confidence interval 0.9
[3]to 2.8 is not statistically significant; correct?
[4]A. The hierarchical regression is 1.6, and the
[5]other one is 2.1. That's correct.
[6]Q. And the hierarchical regression is not
[7]statistically significant; correct?
[8]A. Yes. I just don't know whether that is
[9]really -- again, you know, the controlling for
[10]pesticides, does it really matter if it's logistical
[11]regression versus hierarchical regression? I can't
[12]really answer that.
[13]Q. Well, that's the one that is controlled for
[14]other pesticides --
[15]A. Well, you control --
[16]Q. -- isn't it?
[17]A. You also -- when you do a logistic
[18]regression, you actually do control for other
[19]factors, including pesticides. So I'm not really
[20]sure whether they didn't -- you know, whether one
[21]negates the other. That's what I'm trying to say.
[22]Q. Okay. Do you know of anywhere where they
[23]reported that, in the logistic regression, they
[24]controlled for other pesticides?
[25]A. I'll have to read the whole paper again. I
  Page 212
[1]don't think we have time for that. I'm trying to
[2]read the statistical --
[3]Q. Go ahead and read it. We can take a -- we
[4]can --
[5]A. Okay.
[6]Q. We can pause while you do that.
[7](Pause.)
[8]A. Okay. I read that.
[9]Q. Okay. And did you find anywhere where they
[10]say that other pesticides were controlled in the
[11]logistic regression as opposed to the hierarchical?
[12]A. I did not. But I saw just a couple things,
[13]and I'll just mention them. So they do mention here
[14]that they -- "We employed two approaches to our
[15]analysis, standard logistic regression -- maximum
[16]likelihood estimation and hierarchical regression --
[17]calculating odds ratio to estimate the relative risk
[18]associated with each pesticide."
[19]Then they go on to say, "All models
[20]included variables for age and indicator variables
[21]for study site, other factors known or suspected to
[22]be associated with NHL including first-degree
[23]relative with hematopoietic cancer. Education and
[24]smoking were evaluated and found not to be important
[25]confounders of the association between NHL and
  Page 213
[1]pesticides," for whatever it's worth.
[2]Q. The next study you mention is the Lee
[3]study, sir.
[4](Nabhan Exhibit 15 marked for
[5]identification.)
[6]Q. This actually used data from Cantor, which
[7]we've already discussed, and one other U.S.
[8]case-control study; is that right?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. And the odds ratios reported here were not
[11]adjusted for exposure to other pesticides; true?
[12]A. Repeat again, please.
[13]Q. The odds ratios reported were not adjusted
[14]for exposure to other pesticides; right?
[15]A. No, it was not. It was adjusted for age,
[16]vital status, and state.
[17]Q. The hypothesis under investigation was
[18]whether asthma modifies the risk of NHL associated
[19]with pesticide exposures; correct?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. And in people exposed to glyphosate, there
[22]was no statistical significant association either in
[23]people with or without asthma; correct?
[24]A. That is correct. The odds ratio was above
[25]1 for both, but it was not -- it did cross the 1.
  Page 214
[1]Q. It did cross the 1.
[2]And do you know of any sort of analysis
[3]that has been done to compare the 1.2 to the 1.4 to
[4]see if there is a statistically significant
[5]difference between people with and without asthma?
[6]A. I'm not aware of that. I don't know.
[7]Q. Okay. You have no conclusion about whether
[8]asthma increases or decreases or has no effect on
[9]any risk that you believe exists of non-Hodgkin's
[10]lymphoma from glyphosate; is that fair?
[11]A. Yeah, I -- I don't have any additional
[12]conclusions beyond what the authors have concluded.
[13]And the authors' conclusion suggests that -- and I
[14]quote -- "Our results suggest that the risk of NHL
[15]among asthmatics with pesticide exposure may be
[16]higher than among non-asthmatics with pesticide
[17]exposure."
[18]I have no additional conclusions beyond
[19]what you just stated.
[20]Q. And you don't know if that was specific to
[21]glyphosate; right?
[22]A. They talked about pesticide exposure in
[23]general.
[24]Q. Certainly, the point estimate for people
[25]with asthma was lower than the point estimate for
  Page 215
[1]people without asthma for glyphosate-exposed people;
[2]right?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]MR. GRIFFIS: I need to tidy up my pile
[5]here. Let's take five minutes.
[6]VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record at
[7]2:00 P.M.
[8](Recess taken from 2:00 P.M. to
[9]2:15 P.M.)
[10](Nabhan Exhibit 16 marked for
[11]identification.)
[12]VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record at
[13]2:15 P.M.
[14]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[15]Q. Exhibit 16 is the DeRoos 2005 article,
[16]which is the next one discussed in your expert
[17]report; correct?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. Now, this is a prospective cohort study;
[20]correct?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. All the other ones we've been looking at
[23]are case-control studies; right?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Would you explain the difference to the
  Page 216
[1]jury.
[2]A. So, I mean, case control is -- you know, in
[3]broad term is more of a retrospective study where
[4]you are looking at individuals who are diagnosed
[5]with the disease and those who are not diagnosed
[6]with the disease. And you retrospectively attempt
[7]to analyze exposure or contributing factors that
[8]might have led to the development of the particular
[9]disease.
[10]The cohort study is more of a prospective
[11]evaluation of particular individuals, and you follow
[12]them prospectively. So you are presuming that, at
[13]the time of initiating the particular study, nobody
[14]has the particular disease per se. And you follow
[15]them for whatever period you decide to follow them,
[16]and you assess who developed the disease and why and
[17]what. And you make an analysis.
[18]Q. So in the case-control studies that we've
[19]looked at so far -- like DeRoos 2003, Cantor,
[20]Hardell, McDuffie, et cetera -- the authors
[21]started out with a group of people with
[22]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and then they asked
[23]questions of those people and some others who they
[24]found without non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to be controls
[25]and compared what they said about their past
  Page 217
[1]exposures to all sorts of different pesticides in
[2]all of those studies and then ran some statistics on
[3]them; is that fair?
[4]A. Fair.
[5]Q. Okay. And in this study and in a
[6]prospective cohort study, what they did instead was
[7]gather a bunch of people -- and these were what kind
[8]of people?
[9]A. These were mainly folks that were licensed
[10]to apply restricted-use pesticides.
[11]Q. So these were licensed pesticide
[12]applicators? People who would be exposed to
[13]pesticides; right?
[14]A. But they're licensed, so they're --
[15]usually, they -- they know what they're doing. They
[16]had to have, like, a particular exam criteria to
[17]enter the study and so forth. So they --
[18]Q. Okay.
[19]A. They had -- you know, they had more
[20]knowledge of what they are up against, if you will.
[21]Q. And these are people who did not have
[22]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And they filled out
[23]questionnaires about their exposure to pesticides,
[24]which were renewed at various times.
[25]And then the authors of this study followed
  Page 218
[1]them going forward as the years moved on to see if
[2]they developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; correct?
[3]A. Yes. To my recollection, the folks that
[4]were enrolled were from '93 to '97. And this
[5]particular paper reported on the outcome as of
[6]December 2001. So the follow-up was 6.7 years,
[7]median follow-up.
[8]Q. And one of the things that a cohort
[9]study -- one of the advantages of a cohort study
[10]over a case-control study is that a cohort study
[11]avoids recall bias; is that correct?
[12]A. It avoids the recall bias, but it has its
[13]other limitations.
[14]Q. Recall bias is the bias that's caused by
[15]people who have come down with cancer being more
[16]likely to ruminate, to think about all of the
[17]exposures that they might have had and possibly even
[18]to exaggerate those exposures and to be a lot more
[19]likely to write down in a questionnaire, oh, yes, I
[20]was exposed to this and this and this, than someone
[21]who doesn't have cancer and is going about their
[22]regular life; correct?
[23]A. I agree with everything you said except for
[24]the word "exaggerate." I think, in recall bias,
[25]it's I inherent that, you know, individuals who have
  Page 219
[1]been diagnosed with a particular cancer, they --
[2]they usually, you know, try to remember more. They
[3]try to look more into their past. They ask their
[4]friends. They ask their family and so forth.
[5]Because now you are diagnosed.
[6]I don't know if they would exaggerate. I
[7]think they would probably just investigate more
[8]their history versus somebody who doesn't have
[9]cancer so they're less likely to do a robust or
[10]rigorous investigation.
[11]Q. So in a case-control study, the people with
[12]cancer, the people in the case group, are more
[13]likely to report their past pesticide exposures than
[14]the people in the controls.
[15]That's fair; right?
[16]A. I think the recall bias is for both sides.
[17]I would agree with you that, in general, we do see
[18]that the recall bias could affect individuals who
[19]were diagnosed with cancer more. But, you know, you
[20]could make the same argument for recall bias for the
[21]controls as well, that they may actually forget the
[22]fact that they were exposed to something because
[23]they're not as diligent, because they were -- they
[24]were -- they don't -- they didn't get the diagnosis
[25]of cancer.
  Page 220
[1]So I think the recall bias exists for both.
[2]But, you know, I tend to agree that it's probably
[3]going to be more in folks who are having cancer,
[4]just by human nature.
[5]Q. Okay. So there's two kinds of recall bias.
[6]There is the recall bias of the people -- the cases,
[7]the people with cancer --
[8]A. Right.
[9]Q. -- who are reporting it more thoroughly
[10]than average?
[11]And then there's the careless -- the
[12]relative carelessness of the controls who are just
[13]getting a questionnaire in the mail and don't have
[14]much of a personal stake in it who would be more
[15]likely to forget about things and miss and
[16]underreport their exposure?
[17]A. I agree with that.
[18]Q. Okay. And both of those would tend to bias
[19]the results towards an association, towards a
[20]finding --
[21]A. Or the lack thereof.
[22]Q. -- that a substance causes a particular
[23]outcome; right?
[24]A. Or the lack thereof. I mean, I think it
[25]would bias the conclusion by -- by its inherent
  Page 221
[1]limitations. I just don't know whether it would
[2]bias it to the positive association or a negative
[3]association.
[4]Q. The AHS -- this is the Agricultural Health
[5]Study; right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. And the Agricultural Health Study is not a
[8]single study.
[9]It's not the DeRoos 2005 paper; it's a
[10]larger research project. Correct?
[11]A. Correct. But, to my knowledge, this is the
[12]only publication that came out of it, unless I
[13]missed something. But you are right; it is a
[14]continuous -- I mean, it's all on the website. You
[15]can -- you can -- it has its own website and own
[16]information, which I -- I gathered the data from.
[17]But, to my knowledge, this is the only paper that I
[18]found from the AHS.
[19]Q. About glyphosate?
[20]A. About glyphosate, yeah.
[21]Q. There may be other papers from the AHS
[22]about other things; right?
[23]A. Yeah, I didn't look at that.
[24]Q. Okay. And it's funded by the U.S.
[25]government; right?
  Page 222
[1]A. I honestly don't know who's funding it.
[2]It's probably the NIH, which is U.S. government
[3]but -- I believe it's the -- NIH, yeah.
[4]Q. There were 92 individuals here with
[5]exposure to glyphosate who had non-Hodgkin's
[6]lymphoma; right?
[7]A. 92, correct.
[8]Q. And, again, these were people -- there was
[9]a very large body of people who were being tracked,
[10]and 92 of the ones who developed non-Hodgkin's
[11]lymphoma had an exposure to glyphosate; is that
[12]right?
[13]A. Yeah. I mean, there were -- as you can see
[14]in Table 2, there are other cancers, but the NHL
[15]specifically was 92.
[16]Q. They started out with 57 -- more than
[17]57,000 private and commercial pesticide applicators;
[18]right?
[19]A. Yes. There was 57,311.
[20]Q. And they paid attention to all of the
[21]cancers that these people developed, although they
[22]especially looked at non-Hodgkin's lymphoma because
[23]there had been previous studies done like the ones
[24]we've been talking about; correct?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 223
[1]Q. And they reported -- here, I'm on page 51,
[2]sir, the end of the long paragraph at the top of the
[3]third column.
[4]They reported no association was observed
[5]between NHL and glyphosate exposure in any analysis,
[6]including an analysis comparing the highest with the
[7]lowest quintile of exposure, more than 108 versus 0
[8]to 9 cumulative exposure days; correct?
[9]A. That's what's written here.
[10]Q. Okay. Now, when we were looking earlier at
[11]a -- at an exposure-days-per-year estimate, we were
[12]looking at 0 to 2 versus greater than 2; right?
[13]A. Well, that was in one paper, though.
[14]Q. Yes.
[15]A. Yeah, I mean, that was one paper, I think
[16]McDuffie, that they looked at 0 to 2 versus over
[17]2, yes.
[18]Q. And this was looking at a much greater
[19]range of days; right?
[20]A. I don't know if this one looks at days
[21]per se. I think they -- they had their different
[22]definition. If you -- when you read the -- page 50,
[23]the first column, they constructed three glyphosate
[24]exposure metrics, ever personally mixed or applied,
[25]cumulative lifetime, et cetera, et cetera.
  Page 224
[1]So they have lowest exposed, higher
[2]exposed, never exposed. And so they just use a
[3]different way of deciding exposed versus nonexposed.
[4]Q. And the one described here, the highest
[5]versus the lowest quintile of exposure, was more
[6]than 108 cumulative exposure days versus the lowest,
[7]0 to 9, cumulative exposure days; right?
[8]A. I see that, yes.
[9]Q. And was that a relative risk point estimate
[10]of less than 1; right?
[11]A. I see that, yes.
[12]Q. In Table 2, the ever/never used, the
[13]relative risk point estimate adjusted for age,
[14]demographic, and lifestyle factors in other
[15]pesticides was 1.1 with a confidence interval of 0.7
[16]to 1.9, which is not statistically significant;
[17]correct?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. On Table 3, they looked at cumulative
[20]exposure days and intensity-weighted exposure days;
[21]correct?
[22]A. That is correct.
[23]Q. Now, cumulative exposure days is looking at
[24]how many days people were exposed for, and
[25]intensity-weighted exposure days is adjusting those
  Page 225
[1]days further for how much exposure there was on the
[2]days of exposure; right?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. So if you were just using it a little bit,
[5]that would be a lower intensity day; and if you were
[6]using it a lot, that would be a higher intensity
[7]day; right?
[8]A. So the intensity-weighted cumulative
[9]exposure is a formula. It's years of use multiplied
[10]days per year multiplied by intensity level. And
[11]they're categorized in tertiles.
[12]So I think that, if you use it for so many
[13]years, that will increase it. If you use it for so
[14]many days in a particular year, will increase it and
[15]the intensity will increase. So it's three factors
[16]that could actually bring the number up.
[17]That's on page 50, the second paragraph.
[18]Q. In both groups, the cumulative exposure
[19]days and the intensity-weighted exposure days, the
[20]point --
[21]Well, the point estimate was set to 1.0 for
[22]the lowest exposure group, and then the next two
[23]levels of exposure were compared to that; correct?
[24]A. I don't know if they were compared
[25]relatively or taken by themselves in absolute.
  Page 226
[1]Q. Is there any --
[2]A. In --
[3]Q. In each case, the relative risk given for
[4]the lowest tertile was set to be 1.0.
[5]You can see that all the way down the
[6]column; right?
[7]A. I see that, 1.0.
[8]Q. And then we can see whether there is any
[9]dose effect by seeing if that odds ratio goes up at
[10]the median and high tercile exposure levels;
[11]correct?
[12]A. I see that, yes.
[13]Q. For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the risk goes
[14]down at the median and high exposure group, both for
[15]cumulative exposure days and intensity-weighted
[16]exposures days compared to the lowest tercile;
[17]right?
[18]A. That's what it says, but what does that
[19]mean?
[20]Q. In these data, sir, when people were more
[21]exposed to glyphosate, their risk of non-Hodgkin's
[22]lymphoma went down below 1.0, although it was not
[23]statistically significant on any of these measures;
[24]correct?
[25]A. Sorry. Are you suggesting glyphosate is a
  Page 227
[1]preventive measure against non-Hodgkin lymphoma?
[2]Q. You keep telling me that it's real
[3]important when it's above 1.
[4]What does it mean to you when it's below 1?
[5]A. I can be -- again, I said you can't take
[6]everything in just absolutes. So you can't have
[7]a -- you know, to suggest that, just because it's
[8]below 1, it's going to be a protective effect, then
[9]we should just all go outside and spray ourselves
[10]with glyphosate. Just -- just -- you can't -- I
[11]mean, it's not protective obviously.
[12]Q. There's no way that you can use the figures
[13]in Table 3 to support a hypothesis that glyphosate
[14]causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; correct?
[15]A. No, based on the data in Table 3, I cannot
[16]say that. You're correct.
[17]Q. 92 individuals with exposure to glyphosate
[18]and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is the number in
[19]the DeRoos 2005 study, is the most people with
[20]glyphosate exposure and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of
[21]any published epidemiology study; correct?
[22]A. It is the most number in the studies I
[23]reviewed. I don't know if that encompasses every
[24]single paper in literature.
[25]Q. Okay. Of the ones that you know about,
  Page 228
[1]sir --
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. -- this is the one with the highest power;
[4]right?
[5]A. No. This is the highest number. That's
[6]different than power.
[7]Q. Okay. Tell me --
[8]A. Power, now, is statistics.
[9]Q. Do you think that a different study that
[10]you reviewed has more power than this one?
[11]A. I didn't look at the power of each study.
[12]I think you're correct by saying that this has the
[13]highest number of patients with non-Hodgkin's
[14]lymphoma, 92 cases. That's correct?
[15]But when you say "highest power," then
[16]you'll have to compare the trials from a statistical
[17]standpoint, each one. And I did not perform that,
[18]nor am I qualified to compare statistical power
[19]between -- across studies, and I wouldn't recommend
[20]comparing different studies from a statistical
[21]standpoint. It's not a very good exercise to do
[22]from an academic standpoint.
[23]Q. From an academic standpoint, it's not a
[24]good exercise to compare the power of different
[25]epidemiology studies?
  Page 229
[1]A. To compare across studies, it's not
[2]something that we normally would like to do because
[3]each study has its own. So you're going to -- I
[4]mean, to compare across -- cross-trial comparisons
[5]are not something that we normally would like to do.
[6]Q. And how does that comment apply to the
[7]field of meta-analysis, sir?
[8]A. I'm not sure I understand the question.
[9]Q. Well, a meta-analysis -- meta -- people who
[10]are performing a meta-analysis --
[11]A. Well, there are methodologies for
[12]meta-analysis. If you're conducting a
[13]meta-analysis, you follow a methodology to make sure
[14]that you look at the trials. I mean, there is --
[15]these are oftentimes scientists and statisticians
[16]that are equipped to perform a meta-analysis using
[17]robust criteria and looking at all of the data
[18]that's available.
[19]You're not necessarily comparing the
[20]statistical power of each particular study against
[21]each other. You're trying to look at all of the
[22]studies combined and see, are you seeing any
[23]causation? Are you seeing any association when you
[24]look at the entire body of the literature?
[25]Q. Do you know whether people who are
  Page 230
[1]performing a meta-analysis, as part of the procedure
[2]that they follow, assess the power of each of the
[3]studies that they're looking at and weigh the
[4]meta-analysis in terms of the power of those
[5]studies?
[6]A. I don't know if that's what they do.
[7]Q. All right. Do you know of any other study
[8]besides the DeRoos 2005 study, of the ones that you
[9]looked at, sir, that measured the intensity of
[10]exposure?
[11]A. And when you mean -- by "intensity," you
[12]mean the dose of the compound? Because the
[13]intensity could be just the years of exposure by the
[14]number of years. Or are you talking specifically in
[15]terms of the dose?
[16]Q. I'm talking about intensity-weighted
[17]exposure, like in the second column of Table 3.
[18]A. Yeah, I'm not aware of other studies that
[19]look -- that added the -- you know, again, you can
[20]see the -- you know, the actual number of years by
[21]the number of days per year.
[22]But what they did here is they added
[23]another attempt by adding the actual intensity
[24]level, which is always commendable thing to do. It
[25]has its own limitations because always difficult to
  Page 231
[1]be very accurate with it. But I'm not aware of
[2]other studies that did the same thing.
[3]Q. Do you know of any other study with dose
[4]data like this?
[5]A. Like exactly this one?
[6]Q. Dose data at all, sir. It's important when
[7]you're looking at --
[8]A. Early on, we -- you know, you showed me
[9]the -- and we talked about the Bolognesi paper, I
[10]mean, in terms of aerial spray and in some areas
[11]more, some areas less.
[12]Is this a dose data? I don't know.
[13]Q. I was talking about epidemiology, sir.
[14]But in the Bolognesi paper that you
[15]mentioned, which was a genotoxicity study --
[16]A. Right.
[17]Q. -- not epidemiology --
[18]A. I know.
[19]Q. -- for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, there was
[20]not a dose relationship; correct?
[21]A. Well, I think we -- we are going to
[22]disagree on the interpretation the Bolognesi paper,
[23]but I just -- I'm trying to understand your question
[24]in terms of the dose per se. If you're asking about
[25]the intensity-weighted exposure days as it's defined
  Page 232
[1]in this paper, I'm not aware of other papers that
[2]did the same formula. That's the short answer to
[3]your question based on the papers I reviewed.
[4]Q. In the area of epidemiology --
[5]A. Right.
[6]Q. -- I'm talking about your section headed
[7]"Epidemiology" in your expert report --
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. -- is there any other paper where you
[10]purport to see or not -- or not see a dose response?
[11]A. Let me check a couple of things --
[12]Q. Yes, sir.
[13]A. -- to be more accurate in answering that.
[14]So I think there is a paper by Eriksson
[15]that I reviewed from 2008 that talked about more
[16]than ten days, less than ten days in terms of
[17]different odds ratio. So I don't know if you would
[18]consider that. Again, this is the number of days of
[19]exposure, and they used the cutoff of less than ten
[20]days or more than ten days.
[21]But I think the DeRoos '05 paper, they
[22]specifically added the intensity multiplied by the
[23]number of years multiplied by the number of days per
[24]year. I have not seen that particular formula in
[25]other papers.
  Page 233
[1]But the Eriksson paper, you know, you could
[2]consider this a form of dose response because they
[3]used ten days, less than ten days. The McDuffie
[4]paper that we actually reviewed more than ten days,
[5]less than -- more than two days, less than two days,
[6]you could easily say this was a dose response
[7]because, again, you have a couple of days less or
[8]more.
[9]So each paper and each manuscript has its
[10]own definition of how they define dose intensity.
[11]Q. Unlike the ones you mentioned, this one
[12]controlled for other pesticides; right?
[13]A. I just want to make sure. I believe they
[14]tried to control for pesticides. You will have to
[15]remember that the actual controls here, that they're
[16]never exposed and so forth, were all licensed
[17]applicators that were using pesticides. So I think
[18]you are starting from such a high bar to be able to
[19]demonstrate statistical significance over the
[20]control group.
[21]So, again, you look at the patient
[22]population or the individual population that's going
[23]in, and everybody in the AHS was actually a licensed
[24]applicator. So in order to demonstrate statistical
[25]significant above and beyond, it's way more
  Page 234
[1]difficult than when we take controls that don't have
[2]any of these occupational exposures.
[3]Q. I'm sorry. Were you done answering?
[4]A. Yes, I was.
[5]Q. Okay. The next paper that you mention is
[6]the Fritschi paper; right?
[7]A. Yes, I mentioned that.
[8](Nabhan Exhibit 17 marked for
[9]identification.)
[10]Q. This mentions as possible -- in the first
[11]paragraph, sir -- possible causes of increased risks
[12]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among farmers, exposure to
[13]diesel exhaust and animal viruses.
[14]Do you see that?
[15]A. I see that, yes.
[16]Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether those
[17]are risk factors for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[18]A. I don't have an opinion.
[19]Q. Fritschi is an Australian study?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. And the exposure was assessed by -- the
[22]exposure was established by an occupational
[23]hygienist who reviewed occupational histories and
[24]determined what they felt that the exposure of the
[25]individuals in the study would have been to various
  Page 235
[1]herbicides and pesticides; right?
[2]A. The hygienist and the interviewers were
[3]blinded to the case or control status of the
[4]subjects. So, yes, there were interviews, but there
[5]was blinding of the interviewers.
[6]Q. And the interviews were about the
[7]occupations that people had worked in; correct?
[8]A. Well, again, there are probably more than
[9]just the occupation. It looked at other factors as
[10]well.
[11]Q. And specific tasks?
[12]A. Right.
[13]Q. But the exposure to particular substances
[14]was assigned by an occupational hygienist based on
[15]people's answers about their careers rather than
[16]people saying what substances they had been exposed
[17]to; right?
[18]A. Well, the hygienist was blinded to all of
[19]these. I mean, the same expert occupational
[20]hygienist, again blind to the status, reviewed the
[21]occupational histories and the answers to the
[22]modular questions and determined exposure to various
[23]substance, including argon and phosphates,
[24]et cetera. So it wasn't a priority that the
[25]hygienist knew what was happening.
  Page 236
[1]Q. Oh, sure.
[2]A. They were blinded.
[3]Q. But they didn't ask people, "Have you ever
[4]been exposed to glyphosate?" A hygienist assigned
[5]people based on what they said their occupational
[6]history was. They declared that somebody had or
[7]hadn't been exposed to glyphosate and at what level,
[8]and the same for all sorts of other pesticides and
[9]herbicides; right?
[10]A. You know, I don't think they put the actual
[11]questionnaire. I'm trying to read here. It says
[12]here, "Case in controls and were mailed an
[13]introductory letter, an information leaflet,
[14]followed by self-administered questionnaire to each
[15]consenting subject. The questionnaire included a
[16]diary with a detailed lifetime history of each job
[17]the subject had held for one year or more.
[18]Information obtained on each job included job title,
[19]employer, industry, start and finish years, number
[20]of hours worked per day, and number of days worked
[21]per week."
[22]And they looked at the cases in the
[23]controlled and -- and -- so I don't know if the
[24]assignment was before or after, if that's your
[25]question. Your question is was the assignment after
  Page 237
[1]the answers were available? Is that your question?
[2]Q. No, sir.
[3]It is that when someone was said to be --
[4]have been exposed to a particular substance in this
[5]study, that wasn't based on them saying that they
[6]had been exposed to that substance; it was based on
[7]an occupational hygienist proclaiming that they had
[8]been based on the jobs that they said that they'd
[9]performed in the past?
[10]A. Well, based on their answers. Based on
[11]their answers.
[12]Q. But not their answers about pesticide
[13]exposure.
[14]A. I see. You're saying -- I see. Based
[15]on --
[16]Q. Someone said --
[17]A. -- the answers --
[18]Q. Someone said, I worked -- I was an alfalfa
[19]farmer for two years, and then I herded kangaroos
[20]for six. And the occupational therapist, therefore,
[21]assigned --
[22]A. You're correct.
[23]Q. -- putative pesticide exposure?
[24]A. Now I understand your question.
[25]Q. Okay.
  Page 238
[1]A. Yes, you're correct.
[2]Q. And you don't know how reliable that
[3]methodology is; fair?
[4]A. It's fair to say, yes.
[5]Q. In your expert report, you gave an odds
[6]ratio of 3.29; correct?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. And that was for, as you said, for all --
[9]for other herbicides?
[10]A. For all herbicides, collectively, yes.
[11]Q. You don't know if glyphosate is included in
[12]the figure that you gave; correct?
[13]A. It's not called out specifically in this
[14]trial. They don't recall call out glyphosate
[15]specifically. They include all herbicides.
[16]Q. You don't know what glyphosate's
[17]contribution was, if anything; right?
[18]A. I do not know that, yeah. But glyphosate
[19]is an herbicide, so I would presume it was part of
[20]the -- it was included.
[21]Q. And you don't know if it pulled the odds
[22]ratio up or down or had no effect on it; right?
[23]A. I can't tell.
[24]Q. So what effect did this study have your
[25]opinion?
  Page 239
[1]A. It just solidified that you see that with
[2]herbicides, and glyphosate is an herbicide. So,
[3]again, it's just another demonstration that
[4]herbicides, as a class, could have an increased risk
[5]of causing and contributing to non-Hodgkin's
[6]lymphoma.
[7]Q. Is it your opinion, to a reasonable degree
[8]of medical certainty, that herbicides, as a class,
[9]cause or contribute to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[10]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[11]A. It's -- it's tough to really tell. But you
[12]have data on farmers that use herbicides. You have
[13]a trial like this that has herbicides. So it's --
[14]it's hard to actually lump all of them in just one
[15]basket. I believe that there is some increased risk
[16]with herbicides, and having glyphosate as one of
[17]them solidifies my opinion in terms of the causation
[18]between this compound and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[19]Q. Okay. So are you going to be testifying,
[20]do you have the opinion, that there is a class
[21]effect?
[22]A. I would say there is enough evidence to
[23]suggest. Again, there's -- there would be no
[24]absolutes given what we've talked about several
[25]times. I mean, this -- this -- obviously, this
  Page 240
[1]particular trial shows that herbicides have an
[2]increased odds ratio of developing non-Hodgkin's
[3]lymphoma. It didn't call out glyphosate. The
[4]Cantor study talks about farmers. And, again,
[5]farmers use herbicides.
[6]So when you say a class effect, then your
[7]implying that every single herbicide will have this
[8]causation, and I don't think we can safely say that.
[9]I'm not prepared to say that because I can't say
[10]every single herbicide will have that.
[11]Q. Do you have the opinion that there is any
[12]herbicide that does not cause or contribute to
[13]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[14]A. I don't have an opinion on that.
[15]Q. Do you have an opinion that there is an
[16]herbicide that is safer with regard to non-Hodgkin's
[17]lymphoma than glyphosate?
[18]A. I also don't have opinion on that. I did
[19]not review that.
[20](Nabhan Exhibit 18 marked for
[21]identification.)
[22]Q. Marking as Exhibit 18 the Eriksson study,
[23]sir. And this is another exploratory study that
[24]wasn't designed to specifically test the hypothesis
[25]of an exposure between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's
  Page 241
[1]lymphoma, but to screen multiple herbicides and
[2]pesticides at the same time; right?
[3]A. Correct. It did look at glyphosate,
[4]though, as you can see --
[5]Q. Yes, sir.
[6]A. Okay.
[7]Q. They have results for multiple individual
[8]pesticides.
[9]A. Sure. Okay.
[10]Q. Now, the only adjusted odds ratio reported
[11]in this study that's controlled for confounding by
[12]other pesticides is in Table 7 on page 1661 of the
[13]study; right? The multi-varied analysis?
[14]A. Table -- Table 7, they talked about
[15]adjustment for age, sex, and year of diagnosis or
[16]enrollment. I think on page -- on Table 2, they
[17]also have some adjustments was made for age, sex,
[18]and year of diagnosis -- yeah, these are the three
[19]things they adjusted for.
[20]Q. They are not adjusted for medical
[21]conditions or family history of cancer or smoking or
[22]drinking or any of the lifestyle factors that you've
[23]discussed earlier; right?
[24]A. No, they were not.
[25]MR. GRIFFIS: Let's take five minutes.
  Page 242
[1]VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record at
[2]2:50 P.M.
[3](Recess taken from 2:50 P.M. to
[4]3:01 P.M.)
[5]VIDEOGRAPHER: And we are back on the
[6]record at 3:01 P.M.
[7]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[8]Q. Okay. Sir, the Table 7, "Multi-varied
[9]analysis for glyphosate," the most adjusted odds
[10]ratio for confounders set forth in this study is not
[11]statistically significant; correct?
[12]A. The odds ratio is 1.51.
[13]Q. And it is not statistically significant;
[14]correct?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. When you look at the unadjusted odds ratios
[17]for all the substances in this study, you see that
[18]virtually every single one of them is above 1.0;
[19]right?
[20]A. Which table you are looking at? The same
[21]table?
[22]Q. Let's look at Table 2 first, "Exposure to
[23]various herbicides."
[24]A. Okay.
[25]Q. Herbicides total. That's all greater than
  Page 243
[1]1.
[2]A. Right.
[3]Q. Phenoxyacetic acids, all greater than 1.
[4]Subgroup of MCPA all greater than 1. 2,4,5-T and/or
[5]2,4-D, all greater than 1. Other greater than 1.
[6]Herbicides except phenoxyacetic acids, all greater
[7]than 1. Glyphosate, greater than 1. Other
[8]herbicides, all greater than 1 except for when you
[9]get to greater than 32 days.
[10]Do you see that?
[11]A. I do.
[12]Q. Okay. Now let's turn to Table 4, "Exposure
[13]to various other pesticides."
[14]Without repeating every single thing in
[15]here, we have insecticides, DDT, mercurial seed
[16]dressing, pyrethrin, permethrin, other insecticides,
[17]fungicides, impregnating agents, chlorophenols,
[18]arsenic, creosote, tar, other impregnating agents
[19]and rodenticides.
[20]And virtually every single one is greater
[21]than 1; correct?
[22]A. Some of them are not.
[23]Q. Yeah, some are not. The vast majority are
[24]greater; right?
[25]A. Yes. As long as we acknowledge some are
  Page 244
[1]not.
[2]Q. One, two, three, four are not; right?
[3]A. One, two, three, four. Yes.
[4]Q. And that's out of 34 stated odds ratios;
[5]right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Just in that table?
[8]A. The -- that's actually not -- I mean,
[9]that's not -- 34 odds ratio, but not 34 compounds.
[10]Q. Yes, sir.
[11]A. Okay.
[12]Q. 34 of the odds ratios.
[13]A. Okay.
[14]Q. For each of the ones that was not above 1,
[15]another one of the measurements for a different
[16]period of time for that same substance was greater
[17]than 1; right? So every substance was found to be
[18]greater than 1?
[19]A. Do you mind repeating the question?
[20]Q. Yes, sir.
[21]Where there is an odds ratio in Table 4
[22]below 1 --
[23]A. Uh-hum.
[24]Q. -- for a particular substance, if you look
[25]immediately above or below it, you will find that
  Page 245
[1]same substance for a different time period with an
[2]odds ratio of above 1; right?
[3]A. I see what you're saying. Yes, I do see
[4]that.
[5]Q. So every substance in Table 2, various
[6]herbicides, and 4, pesticides, is greater than 1;
[7]right?
[8]A. For the most part, yes.
[9]Q. Now, when you have a study that is
[10]reporting unadjusted odds ratios for every substance
[11]that it looks at above 1, there is some suggestion
[12]that there is confounding in the results; right?
[13]A. I'm trying to understand your question. So
[14]you're -- you're -- I mean --
[15]Q. Do you believe that every one of these
[16]substances causes NHL?
[17]A. I don't think we know the answer to that.
[18]Q. Okay. Do you think this is evidence that
[19]every one of these substances causes NHL?
[20]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[21]A. I think the -- the -- you know, this is one
[22]paper, one suggestion that there are other
[23]substances that might be implicated in causation or
[24]predisposition to developing NHL. So I will need to
[25]do a formal investigation, let's say, on arsenic by
  Page 246
[1]itself and spend a lot of time to understand if
[2]there is any additional as to arsenic by itself,
[3]because I'm not going to take just one paper and
[4]make a bald conclusion that all of these substances
[5]have causation to NHL.
[6]Q. Well, far as this paper goes, as far as the
[7]Eriksson paper goes, to the extent that you're using
[8]it --
[9]A. It's hypothesis-generating.
[10]Q. -- as evidence of glyphosate causing NHL,
[11]it's also just as good evidence for all these other
[12]substances causing NHL?
[13]A. But this is not the only paper I use for
[14]glyphosate. It's not the only one I cited. So
[15]that's really not correct. I've actually cited a
[16]lot of other papers. So I use this paper in
[17]conjunction with other evidence.
[18]Q. Let me ask the question again.
[19]A. Please.
[20]Q. With regard to this paper --
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. -- to the extent that you use this paper as
[23]evidence that glyphosate causes NHL, this paper is
[24]just as good evidence that each of these other
[25]substances causes NHL; right?
  Page 247
[1]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[2]A. Again, I'm going to try to reemphasize that
[3]this is one paper, so I -- I will agree to one
[4]thing, that, if you take just this one paper, the
[5]evidence appears to be that for glyphosate. There
[6]are other substances as well. But you can't form a
[7]conclusion on causation between a compound and a
[8]disease based on one paper.
[9]So, I mean, this is all I can say regarding
[10]this question.
[11]Q. Yes, sir.
[12]To the extent that this paper is a piece of
[13]the puzzle that you have put together to form an
[14]opinion that glyphosate causes NHL, it would be just
[15]as good a puzzle piece for every one of these other
[16]compounds?
[17]A. If the other compounds have as much
[18]evidence regarding causation with NHL, as the
[19]evidence that I've seen for glyphosate, then the
[20]answer would be correct. But if I try to pick
[21]whichever compound and I find nothing after that,
[22]then it would be just simply hypothesis-generating,
[23]and it wouldn't mean much of it.
[24]So, I mean, I think you're partly correct
[25]that there is something here, but needs to be
  Page 248
[1]investigated further.
[2]Q. And when you do a study of multiple
[3]compounds and you're finding positive association
[4]after positive association -- and by positive, all I
[5]mean is greater than 1 because most of these are not
[6]statistically significant.
[7]A. I understand.
[8]Q. I'm using kind of your definition of --
[9]A. Sure.
[10]Q. -- positive from earlier today. It
[11]suggests that you need to control the exposures that
[12]you're most interested in for all of those other
[13]compounds so that you can find out whether you have
[14]a real effect or one that's confounded; correct?
[15]A. See, it's not necessarily true, because the
[16]issue of controlling for these confounding factors
[17]is really for both cohorts, for the cases and the
[18]controls. I mean, you have two types of population.
[19]You have the population of those folks who developed
[20]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the population that did
[21]not develop non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[22]So, you know, you're trying to apply the
[23]confounding factor in terms of controlling only to
[24]the one folks who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The
[25]reality is you will control for these factors in
  Page 249
[1]both populations, in the cases and the controls. So
[2]you can make an argument, a valid argument, and it
[3]becomes a washout because you are going to control
[4]for these confounding factors for both of them.
[5]Q. That's what you do when you control for
[6]confounding; you control for both. Right?
[7]A. Right. That's what I'm saying.
[8]Q. And what we've seen, in study after study
[9]today, is that when you control for other pesticide
[10]exposures, results that were statistically
[11]significant become not statistically significant for
[12]glyphosate; correct?
[13]A. No. I think what we are -- what we -- what
[14]I can say is that there are studies that we reviewed
[15]together earlier today that did not control for
[16]other pesticide exposure. What I'm going to argue
[17]is I don't know whether controlling for these
[18]pesticide exposures would have changed the odds
[19]ratio positively or negatively. The test was not
[20]done to -- to -- so speculating that just by
[21]controlling, the odds ratio will disappear is a
[22]complete speculation. As a scientist, I can't agree
[23]to that.
[24]Q. Tell me of a statistically significant
[25]association between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's
  Page 250
[1]lymphoma in the epidemiology you looked at that is
[2]controlled for other pesticides.
[3]A. But, again, I think we reviewed -- I mean,
[4]you have seen my -- my report. These are the
[5]studies I looked at, and they have to be solidified
[6]substantially with the IARC report as well as
[7]additional meta-analysis.
[8]So, you know, the IARC report, which is the
[9]highest authority, in my opinion, in determining a
[10]causation between any type of a compound,
[11]occupational compound, and cancer, has looked at
[12]these data as well as other data and made a
[13]conclusion that it's probably carcinogenic to
[14]humans.
[15]So I have to take that into consideration
[16]in addition to the data that I've actually looked
[17]at. The IARC folks obviously and clearly have
[18]looked at animal data and other data plus the
[19]epidemiologic literature that did not always control
[20]for confounding factors. And yet, after all of
[21]this, they did find evidence that it's probably
[22]carcinogenic to humans.
[23]So, you know, I think there's enough
[24]literature out there between these studies that we
[25]just reviewed, the IARC, the meta-analysis to
  Page 251
[1]demonstrate, in my opinion, that there's a causation
[2]between this compound and the disease.
[3]Q. Explain to the jury, please, why you
[4]believe IARC to be the highest authority on the
[5]subject of whether a substance causes cancer?
[6]A. It is not just my own individual belief. I
[7]think it is the belief of everybody in the field
[8]that IARC is the -- this is what they do. This is
[9]what they are tasked with. And in addition to that,
[10]this is what they do and this is what they are
[11]tasked with, their data and their output was
[12]published in the most prestigious journal, more
[13]prestigious than all of these journals that we just
[14]reviewed today, in Lancet, where the acceptance rate
[15]is less -- is close to 5 percent. So they reject
[16]95 percent of manuscripts that they get submitted.
[17]So we can't ignore the most powerful
[18]evidence that is out there. So I have to -- I
[19]relied on it clearly, as well as additional studies
[20]that I cited.
[21]Q. And do you believe that a Lancet peer
[22]review of an IARC Monograph means that the people
[23]who did the peer review believe that the conclusions
[24]of the authors were correct or just that they
[25]followed a particular methodology as stated and came
  Page 252
[1]to a particular conclusion?
[2]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form. Asked and
[3]answered.
[4]A. So when you do a peer review -- and as you
[5]probably know from my CV, I do quite a few of peer
[6]review for very good and prestigious journals -- you
[7]actually have to look at the hypothesis, whether the
[8]methodology is sound, whether the authors were free
[9]of bias, and whether their conclusions actually were
[10]supported by the evidence that they provide. You
[11]can't conclude something and you have no evidence in
[12]the paper to it. I mean, you just can't. So that's
[13]what you look at.
[14]Now, you may not always agree with the
[15]conclusion, but your job as a peer reviewer is to
[16]look at the evidence that they provide and to review
[17]that evidence and see if it correlates with the
[18]conclusion. And then you make a decision. Do you
[19]reject the paper because you don't believe -- not
[20]because you don't believe in the -- you don't
[21]believe it was the proper way to be done, or do you
[22]accept it but you request additional revisions and
[23]you have additional inquiries because you believe
[24]the author should really provide more details,
[25]et cetera?
  Page 253
[1]I'm sure you're familiar with the
[2]peer-review process. So I don't want to waste time
[3]by just talking about how it's done, but this is how
[4]we do it.
[5]You don't have to always agree with what
[6]they come up with. But I can say that most peer
[7]reviews, if you believe the conclusions are so out
[8]there, you are going to reject the paper. You're
[9]going to say -- and you will e-mail the editor and
[10]say, This is making no sense to me.
[11]Q. You know that, sir, in a hazard assessment,
[12]which is what IARC does -- hazard, not risk -- a
[13]hazard assessment is consistent with a conclusion
[14]that a chemical -- that humans are never exposed to
[15]a chemical at a level that can cause them to get
[16]cancer?
[17]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to --
[18]Q. Do you agree or disagree?
[19]MR. LITZENBURG: -- form.
[20]If you understand it . . .
[21]A. I don't understand the question.
[22]Q. Yes, sir.
[23]A. I think we talked about it earlier this
[24]morning, but I think this -- you're asking the
[25]question differently, so I don't understand it.
  Page 254
[1]Q. Do you believe that IARC's conclusion means
[2]that IARC thinks that human beings actually get
[3]cancer from glyphosate and are at risk of getting
[4]cancer from glyphosate at the levels at which humans
[5]are actually exposed to glyphosate?
[6]A. I think their -- the IARC conclusion speaks
[7]for itself. They said it's probably carcinogenic to
[8]humans. That's what they said.
[9]Q. Yes.
[10]And do you believe that that means that
[11]IARC thinks that humans actually get cancer from
[12]humans [sic] and can actually get cancer at the
[13]levels at which humans are exposed?
[14]A. I think they believe it's probably
[15]carcinogenic. That's what they believe. They
[16]obviously clearly did not say it's absolutely
[17]100 percent positively. They said it's probably.
[18]Q. Yes. And I'm asking if you understand what
[19]"carcinogenic" means in a hazard assessment.
[20]Does it mean that it's actually out there
[21]causing human cancers or that there's a theoretical
[22]possibility of this substance causing cancer in
[23]human beings?
[24]MR. LITZENBURG: You have asked and
[25]answered four times now. Just because you're
  Page 255
[1]not getting the answer that you want --
[2]A. I've answered the question.
[3]MR. LITZENBURG: -- doesn't mean you get to
[4]keep asking it.
[5]Q. Go ahead, sir.
[6]A. I have answered this question before, and I
[7]believe that, yes, there is enough evidence to
[8]suggest that glyphosate probably causes human
[9]cancer.
[10]Q. Do you understand that IARC -- according to
[11]IARC, the Monographs program may identify cancer
[12]hazards even when risks are very low with known
[13]patterns of use or exposure?
[14]A. I did not know that.
[15]Q. An agent is considered a cancer hazard if
[16]it is capable of causing cancer under some
[17]circumstances. That's hazard.
[18]Risk measures the probability that cancer
[19]will occur, taking into account the level of
[20]exposure to the agent.
[21]Do you understand that distinction, sir?
[22]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form. I'd like
[23]to know what you're reading from or have it
[24]marked.
[25]Q. The IARC Monograph.
  Page 256
[1]Go ahead, sir.
[2]The IARC Monograph questions and answers.
[3]Sir, my question to you is, do you
[4]understand that that's the difference between risk
[5]and hazard, according to IARC?
[6]A. Okay. I would like to read what they --
[7]what they wrote before I answer your question.
[8]Q. It's not in Monograph 112.
[9]A. Okay.
[10]MR. LITZENBURG: I thought you just said it
[11]was.
[12]Q. Well, here's my question.
[13]A. Okay. I thought you just said this was in
[14]the Monograph.
[15]Q. The Monograph Q&A. It's a different
[16]document --
[17]A. Sure.
[18]Q. -- than the Monograph 112.
[19]Do you understand that the difference
[20]between hazard and risk, according to IARC, is that
[21]an agent is considered a cancer hazard if it is
[22]capable of causing cancer under some circumstances?
[23]A. Okay.
[24]Q. Whereas risk measures the probability that
[25]cancer will occur, taking into account the level of
  Page 257
[1]exposure to the agent.
[2]Do you understand that about IARC's --
[3]A. I understand the difference. I did not
[4]know that this is how they define it. But as you
[5]frame it right now, I understand the differences,
[6]yes.
[7]Q. Okay. And is your assessment of the hazard
[8]of glyphosate in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma the same as
[9]IARC's, i.e., that you have identified what you
[10]believe to be a cancer hazard, an agent capable of
[11]causing cancer under some circumstances, but you
[12]have not measured the probability that cancer will
[13]occur?
[14]MR. LITZENBURG: Object. That's a
[15]mischaracterization.
[16]You can answer.
[17]THE WITNESS: I can answer?
[18]MR. LITZENBURG: Yeah, I mean, if you . . .
[19]A. I believe that there is a hazard with the
[20]exposure to glyphosate and development of
[21]non-Hodgkin lymphoma. I cannot quantify what that
[22]hazard is, so I cannot tell you that people who are
[23]exposed to glyphosate have 50 percent risk versus
[24]2 percent risk.
[25]If that is what you're asking, I don't
   f I
   c
   h
   ?
[1]
   on-azard s
   .
  Page 258
[1]believe I have sufficient information to quantify
[2]that risk, but I believe that risk exists.
[3]And part of the reason we -- you know, in
[4]epidemiology study, occupational studies, it's
[5]really important to look at the hazard as opposed to
[6]actual absolute risk is because they're a very easy
[7]preventable thing. It's an easy -- you know, to
[8]prevent the development of a particular cancer,
[9]which all oncologists would love to see, if you just
[10]say, you know, whether the risk is 1 percent or a
[11]10 percent or a 50 percent, you know what, it's
[12]great. We are going to eliminate this so you don't
[13]have that risk. Because that's an easy thing to do.
[14]So the actual absolute risk, it's not
[15]really as important. I mean, we wear seat belts not
[16]because we're going to get into a car accident every
[17]day, because in case we get in a car accident, the
[18]risk of dying is significantly lower.
[19]So I think, you know, that's why the
[20]absolute risk category is not as important in
[21]occupational hazards, in occupational studies,
[22]because we can eliminate that easily.
[23]Q. You can't give an opinion that an
[24]individual exposed to glyphosate has their risk of
[25]NHL go up by 1 percent or 45 percent or 90 percent
  Page 259
[1]or any particular percent; right?
[2]A. No. I can say it will increase, but I
[3]don't know by how much percentage. So it's not
[4]zero.
[5]Q. But it could be 1?
[6]A. It could be 1. It could be 15. It could
[7]be 90.
[8]Q. Okay. And you have not made any attempt to
[9]quantify how much the risk increases for someone
[10]exposed to glyphosate, in your opinion; right?
[11]A. I think it's difficult to quantify. I
[12]think it's -- you know, it's difficult for me, as a
[13]clinician, as a researcher, to actually quantify
[14]that risk. But I think the presence of the risk is
[15]sufficient because it's a preventable strategy to --
[16]to reduce the risk.
[17]Q. Do you know that IARC has stated that the
[18]term "probable" in "probable human carcinogen" -- in
[19]the phrase "probably human carcinogen" has no
[20]quantitative significance?
[21]A. I'm not surprised.
[22]Q. Okay. And does it have no quantitative
[23]significance in your evaluation as well?
[24]A. Yeah, I just said it's hard -- it's
[25]impossible to really quantify that risk. Again,
  Page 260
[1]your questions are only answered by a prospective
[2]randomized trial where you expose folks to
[3]glyphosate and don't expose others and you follow
[4]them for whatever years you decide and see what is
[5]the risk difference. That's something that will
[6]never happen.
[7]To accurately assess the risk and to
[8]quantify the risk, that cannot happen. That is
[9]impossible to -- all that we can say is that there
[10]is evidence that the risk exists, but it could be
[11]1 percent to 99 percent. It's not 100 percent, and
[12]it's not zero.
[13]Q. Do you have an opinion based on everything
[14]you've reviewed and everything you know that there
[15]is any way to tell in a particular person whether an
[16]exposure to glyphosate or something else caused
[17]their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[18]A. I think sometimes, if you have certain
[19]individuals that have been exposed more and -- you
[20]know, it's possible that this might actually -- I
[21]mean, I think we've reviewed a couple of studies
[22]where you have more than ten days, less than ten
[23]days, more than two days, less than two days.
[24]So there is a possibility, although I
[25]acknowledge that it's not always that -- you know,
  Page 261
[1]the dose response is very vague in -- in these type
[2]of studies. But there is a possibility that
[3]sometimes, if you are more exposed for a longer
[4]period of time, you could logically have more risk.
[5]I mean, if you are not wearing protective
[6]clothes or things like that, I mean, I -- it's --
[7]you know, you have some skin abrasions or skin
[8]damage. I mean, so there are certain things that
[9]might lend me to believe that this particular
[10]individual has a higher risk than another
[11]individual. Each case is very different, obviously,
[12]but that's why you can't really quantify the risk,
[13]because it's just one element. It's one factor.
[14]Q. Based on everything that you reviewed and
[15]everything that you know, is there any way to tell
[16]that someone opposed to glyphosate and to other
[17]substances capable of causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[18]developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma because of
[19]glyphosate rather than those other substances?
[20]A. I think you'll have to look at each
[21]individual case. It's -- you know, it's hard to --
[22]it's hard to speculate. You'll have to look at what
[23]other -- what are these substances, how often he or
[24]she was exposed to these substances, how were they
[25]applied, top -- I mean, it's just -- each substance
   .
   s

   y
   s
   gh
   .
   r
   y
   e
   r .
   n
   o
   .
  Page 262
[1]is different. So it's hard to really tell.
[2]I think a lot of times we can try to
[3]exercise clinical judgment and scientific evidence
[4]to try to tease out which -- which is probably the
[5]more offending factor to the extent possible.
[6]Sometimes we're successful; sometimes we're not.
[7]Q. So it would be a matter of weighing the
[8]different exposures, how much they were exposed, how
[9]toxic we believe the substances to be?
[10]A. Which are the substances, do these
[11]substances really cause -- cause lymphoma or not,
[12]how often were they -- he or she were exposed to,
[13]et cetera. You know what I mean. I mean, you just
[14]have to look at the type of substances, the amount
[15]of exposure, how they were applied. And then you
[16]have to look at these substances where there's
[17]really data that truly are associated with the
[18]disease.
[19]I mean, if the person is smoking heavily
[20]and drinking heavily and they're doing glyphosate, I
[21]don't have any evidence that smoking and alcohol
[22]necessarily cause lymphoma. So just because they're
[23]smoking and drinking, it doesn't mean that they're
[24]confounding factors. So I think you'd have to look
[25]at each case individually.
  Page 263
[1]Q. Do you have the opinion, to a reasonable
[2]degree of medical certainty, that any substance
[3]other than glyphosate has a synergistic effect or an
[4]additive effect with glyphosate to increase the risk
[5]of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[6]A. I don't think this has been adequately
[7]studied in the literature.
[8]Q. So you don't have that opinion at this
[9]time?
[10]A. At this time, I don't have this opinion.
[11]Q. The next epidemiology study that you
[12]mentioned, sir, is the Orsi study?
[13]A. Do you have that?
[14]Q. I'll get it out if you need it.
[15]Do you remember that it has an odds ratio
[16]of exactly 1?
[17]A. I'll look at what I wrote here. I don't
[18]write in my note here the odds ratio. I think what
[19]I wrote, a French study that spanned 2000 to 2004 by
[20]Orsi, L. suggested increased risk of developing
[21]Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma in patients exposed to
[22]pesticides. This study was conducted amongst six
[23]centers looking at incident cases with lymphoid
[24]neoplasm diagnosis in patients aged 18 to 75 years.
[25]Control cases were patients with rheumatology and
  Page 264
[1]orthopedic problems within the same participating
[2]institutions.
[3]And I did acknowledge here in this study
[4]little evidence was shown in this study as to the
[5]relationship between NHL and exposure, but there was
[6]evidence with HL and myeloma. And myeloma is
[7]obviously a B-cell type of cancer that --
[8]Q. Do you have an opinion, to a reasonable
[9]degree of medical certainty, that glyphosate causes
[10]multiple myeloma?
[11]A. I did not investigate multiple myeloma to
[12]the extent it allows me to give you an opinion that
[13]I'm comfortable with at this point.
[14]Q. Okay. Do you have the opinion that
[15]glyphosate causes any malignancy other than
[16]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[17]A. I did not look at other malignancies. So
[18]it -- it may cause other malignancies. It may not.
[19]But I only looked at non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
[20]Q. And do you recall that the point estimate
[21]for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with glyphosate in the
[22]Orsi study was 1.0?
[23]A. If you can show me this, I can look at it.
[24]Q. Sure.
[25]A. In my report, I did not put the estimate.
  Page 265
[1]Q. Okay.
[2]A. But I did acknowledge that it was little
[3]evidence. And I wrote here, "This might be a sample
[4]effect as only 244 cases of NHL were evaluated in
[5]this study." So my opinion was that it wasn't
[6]enough sample size.
[7]Q. When you say "sample effect," you mean the
[8]study was too small?
[9]A. That's what I -- that's what I believe I
[10]concluded when I reviewed the study.
[11]Q. Okay. I mean, that's what you mean by
[12]"sample effect"; right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14](Nabhan Exhibit 19 marked for
[15]identification.)
[16]Q. So I've marked as Exhibit 19 the Orsi
[17]study. If you'll look at Table 3, you'll see the
[18]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma results.
[19]A. Yeah, 244 cases, 436 control. So I thought
[20]the number of cases were -- was pretty small.
[21]Q. And you saw that the odds ratio for
[22]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated with glyphosate
[23]was 1.0?
[24]A. One -- one second. 1.0, yes.
[25]Q. Which, by any definition, is no effect?
  Page 266
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. Okay. The Cocco study -- I'm just trying
[3]to finish up your studies, sir -- from 2013 had only
[4]four individuals with exposure to glyphosate and
[5]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[6]A. If you don't mind, I'd like to look at it
[7]again.
[8]Q. Yes, sir.
[9](Nabhan Exhibit 20 marked for
[10]identification.)
[11]A. Thank you. Okay. I think this was a
[12]larger sample size study in terms of the number of
[13]lymphoma and the number of cases and was in several
[14]European countries.
[15]Q. And there were four exposed cases, Table 4?
[16]A. Which table that is?
[17]Q. 4?
[18]A. Table 4. Yeah, four cases, I see that.
[19]Q. Two controls --
[20]A. Right.
[21]Q. -- and a nonsignificant and wide-range
[22]confidence interval; right?
[23]A. I just show 3.1, but crosses the 1.
[24]Q. And did you believe this study to have
[25]power and significance to you with four cases and

[1]two controls?
[2]A. I mean, yeah -- no. I mean, I think the --
[3]here's what you would take from this study: So when
[4]you look at the Orsi study, the one before, we had
[5]only 244 cases of lymphoma and we saw an odds ratio
[6]of 1.0.
[7]When you increase the sample size and you
[8]looked at 2,348 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, 2,462
[9]control cases, the odds ratio went up to 3.1.
[10]Yes, it crosses the 1. Yes, the 95 percent
[11]confidence interval is 0.6 to 17.1, but it just goes
[12]to show that you that the Orsi study that we just
[13]reviewed that was odds ratio of 1.0 was so because
[14]of the number -- the number is too small, the number
[15]of cases.
[16]So I think all what you can conclude from
[17]this trial, the Cocco trial, the number obviously
[18]four cases and two control, these numbers are small.
[19]But it just goes to show you that, sometimes when
[20]you have higher number in the denominators, you
[21]could have a significant odds ratio or at least
[22]above 1 odds ratio despite the fact it crosses the
[23]1.
[24]Q. When the sample size, meaning the number of
[25]cases --
  Page 268
[1]A. The number of all cases, right.
[2]Q. -- exposed cases to the -- to the substance
[3]under investigation goes down dramatically, then you
[4]have a bigger sample size problem; correct?
[5]A. What I'm saying is when you have enough
[6]numbers, denominator-wise, of patients that you are
[7]looking at with the disease or without the disease,
[8]the likelihood of detecting something with the
[9]positive -- with the positive exposure, and that
[10]is -- with a higher odds ratio, becomes more likely.
[11]So I only use this in contrast of the Orsi
[12]paper. The Orsi paper has an odds ratio of 1.0, but
[13]only 244 cases that were looked at with NHL. The
[14]Cocco paper looked at over 2,000 cases of NHL. And,
[15]yes, they found small number of exposure to
[16]glyphosate versus non, but the odds ratio went up.
[17]So it's only used in my expert report in
[18]way to contrast the numbers. When you have higher
[19]numbers of patients that you are looking at, it is
[20]possible that the odds ratio will change.
[21]Q. What it means is that you had a population
[22]that was much less exposed to glyphosate in that
[23]time period; right?
[24]A. That's one way of looking at it, but that's
[25]not the only way.
  Page 269
[1]Q. It's the right way, isn't it? Because the
[2]relevant factor that you look at when you're looking
[3]at the power and predictable value of a study is the
[4]number of exposed cases for the relevant exposure?
[5]A. But that's one study. I mean, there are
[6]other studies that we looked at that had different
[7]numbers and different -- again, I mean, if we are
[8]looking at this particular study, I told you how I
[9]used it personally. I didn't use it to look
[10]necessarily at the percentage of glyphosate exposed
[11]individuals and how often did they develop --
[12]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I looked at in contrast to
[13]a previous study, because I was trying to understand
[14]the one that had significantly low number.
[15]I think we reviewed over 10 or 12 studies
[16]earlier that have different numbers. So I don't
[17]want to take this out of context as the only --
[18]again, this is part of what I looked at, not the
[19]only thing I looked at.
[20]Q. Certainly. I'm just trying to understand
[21]what you're telling me, sir --
[22]A. Sure.
[23]Q. -- that the number of people in the study
[24]who didn't have an exposure to glyphosate and
[25]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is relevant to the validity
  Page 270
[1]of the point estimate that you get in the study,
[2]independently of the number of exposed cases?
[3]A. I think you increase -- I think you're more
[4]interested in the cases that were diagnosed and
[5]exposed versus the cases that were not diagnosed and
[6]exposed. I mean case control, when you are looking
[7]at things.
[8]Q. Cases that were diagnosed and exposed in
[9]this is four?
[10]A. Four, yeah.
[11]Q. Very low number; right?
[12]A. It's small. Very low number. I
[13]acknowledge that. And I -- you know, nobody can
[14]argue that four is a large number, but I was trying
[15]to explain that I used this type of paper just for
[16]simple fact it's a lot of numbers, it's over 2,000
[17]patients -- 2,000 patients and 2,000 control. So
[18]obviously it's a large number.
[19]Yes, the exposure rate was not as high.
[20]But, again, that's when you have higher number and
[21]so forth, you can have higher odds ratio, just
[22]similar to -- you know, in contrast with the
[23]previous paper. That's really the -- how I use this
[24]paper.
[25]VIDEOGRAPHER: Can I take a moment to
  Page 271
[1]change discs?
[2]MR. GRIFFIS: Yeah.
[3]VIDEOGRAPHER: Ending Disc No. 3 of the
[4]deposition of Dr. Chadi Nabhan. Off the record
[5]at 3:34 P.M.
[6](Recess taken from 3:34 P.M. to

[8]VIDEOGRAPHER: And beginning Disc No. 4 of
[9]the deposition of Dr. Chadi Nabhan. We are
[10]back on the record at 3:37 P.M.
[11]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[12]Q. Sir, the last epidemiology study that you
[13]mentioned is the Kato study, and let me know if we
[14]need to get it out, but that involves a point
[15]estimate for all pesticides put together; correct?
[16]A. Yeah, I'd like you to give me a sample,
[17]please.
[18]Q. Sure.
[19](Nabhan Exhibit 21 marked for
[20]identification.)
[21]Q. Are you ready, sir?
[22]A. I'm ready.
[23]Q. Okay. So the Kato study involved women who
[24]worked at farms where pesticides were used; correct?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 272
[1]Q. And you reported an odds ratio of 2.12,
[2]which was statistically significant at a 95 percent
[3]confidence interval; correct?
[4]A. That is correct.
[5]Q. And glyphosate was not broken down in this
[6]study; right?
[7]A. I don't believe they looked at each
[8]particular one. This was more in general with
[9]pesticides.
[10]Q. And what did you rely on this study for
[11]informing your opinion, sir?
[12]A. Again, I think similar to other studies
[13]that did not look at particular compounds but they
[14]looked at pesticides as a whole, given the fact that
[15]the glyphosate in its nature is a -- is, again,
[16]could be considered part of the category. So that
[17]just solidifies the opinion.
[18]Q. And do you have the opinion that glyphosate
[19]forms any part of the risk that is purported to be
[20]measured by this study?
[21]A. As I said, they did not tease out
[22]glyphosate by itself.
[23]Q. You can't say that it increased or
[24]decreased or had no effect on the risk measured in
[25]the study; correct?
  Page 273
[1]A. Based on this study, I cannot say that.
[2]MR. GRIFFIS: I know you just changed the
[3]tape, but I need to get organized for the next
[4]phase, so let's take a break.
[5]VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record at
[6]3:40 P.M.
[7](Recess taken from 3:40 P.M. to
[8]3:50 P.M.)
[9]VIDEOGRAPHER: And we are back on the
[10]record at 3:50 P.M.
[11]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[12]Q. Okay. Sir, we've just gone through the
[13]entirety of your -- the section of your expert
[14]report entitled "Epidemiological studies," which
[15]went from page 11 to page 15. And now I'd like to
[16]look at the next section entitled "Meta-analyses."
[17]And you talked about two meta-analyses, one
[18]by Schinasi and León and one by Chang and Delzell
[19]from 2016; correct?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. You said that the meta-analysis by Schinasi
[22]and León found an association between glyphosate and
[23]B-cell lymphoma with an odds ratio of 2.0, and this
[24]was the same odds ratio for diffuse large B-cell
[25]lymphoma; correct?
  Page 274
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. And why did you give that particular point
[3]estimate and not the other point estimates? Why did
[4]you select that one from the Schinasi and León
[5]meta-analysis, sir?
[6]A. Do you have a copy of this? I want to make
[7]sure I -- a copy of the meta-analysis, please.
[8]Q. Maybe.
[9](Nabhan Exhibit 22 marked for
[10]identification.)
[11]A. Thank you.
[12]Q. Marked as Exhibit 22, sir.
[13]A. Sure. So I think this meta-analysis, they
[14]started with 858 articles. 44 were included in the
[15]qualitative analysis, and of these 20 papers,
[16]provided estimates of association with herbicide
[17]chemical groups or active ingredients. And I think
[18]you -- I go on to mention, of the included papers,
[19]several had data on glyphosate specifically, and I
[20]cite the papers that the meta-analysis used for
[21]glyphosate in my expert report. And these studies
[22]were performed in the U.S., Canadian, Europe,
[23]Australia, and New Zealand.
[24]Q. And you say you cited the ones that they
[25]relied on for the meta-analysis in your expert
  Page 275
[1]report, you mean the ones listed on pages 15 to 16?
[2]A. Yeah. I mean, I cite several of the
[3]included papers, several had data on glyphosate.
[4]Q. So Cantor, Cocco, DeRoos 2003, DeRoos 2005,
[5]Eriksson, Hardell, and Orsi; correct?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. And we've discussed all of those today;
[8]right?
[9]A. We have.
[10]Q. What -- and you say, after you discuss the
[11]findings of the meta-analysis briefly, that this
[12]represented "a summary of the data published in the
[13]preceding 25 years and solidifies a plausible
[14]association between glyphosate and NHL evolution and
[15]development." Correct?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. I'd like to understand some of your terms,
[18]first of all, sir. What do you mean by a "plausible
[19]association"?
[20]A. Plausible association means that there is a
[21]causation between the compound that we are looking
[22]at and the disease under investigation.
[23]Q. Plausible association means the same as
[24]causation to you?
[25]A. So you mean between -- the difference
  Page 276
[1]between association and causation?
[2]Q. I'm talking about the terms that you chose,
[3]"plausible association," and I asked you to explain
[4]what you meant by it.
[5]A. To a reasonable degree of certainty, it
[6]does mean causation to me.
[7]Q. Okay. So when you used it here, you meant
[8]causation. And you said between glyphosate and NHL
[9]evolution and development.
[10]Did you mean by "NHL evolution and
[11]development" something other than glyphosate causes
[12]NHL?
[13]A. Well, causing is development; evolution is
[14]the disease that progresses or changes course after
[15]it's being developed. So, I mean, I think there
[16]is -- it's -- you know, when you look at disease
[17]like diffused large B-cell lymphoma, sometimes it
[18]starts as a diffused large B-cell lymphoma,
[19]occasionally it transforms from a low-grade lymphoma
[20]to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
[21]So it's not clear, you know, how much of
[22]this disease is evolved from a different entity
[23]within lymphoma to diffused large B-cell lymphoma
[24]versus just start de novo as the large cell
[25]lymphoma.
  Page 277
[1]So I think the meta-analysis suggests that
[2]there is this association between the compound and
[3]the disease.
[4]Q. Are there any studies or any scientific
[5]articles, sir, on the subject of NHL evolution with
[6]glyphosate as you have just described it?
[7]A. No. I'm -- I'm not aware. It's very
[8]difficult to look at that, because the evolution
[9]requires continued investigation pathologically. So
[10]when lymphoma changes from one entity to a different
[11]type of lymphoma, you have to confirm this with
[12]repeated prospective biopsies, and this can't be
[13]done. So you just speculate. Again, this is just a
[14]speculation that --
[15]Q. Yes, sir.
[16]A. We have diffused large B-cell lymphoma, but
[17]is it really the de novo large cell lymphoma versus
[18]something that's evolved from something else.
[19]That's really all that I meant.
[20]Q. Okay. So you are not claiming, to a
[21]reasonable degree of medical certainty, that you
[22]have evidence that glyphosate causes evolution or
[23]development of NHL from one phase to another phase
[24]as opposed to just being associated with NHL in
[25]general; right?
  Page 278
[1]A. Let me rephrase --
[2]Q. Yes, sir.
[3]A. -- to be very accurate. Diffused large
[4]B-cell lymphoma sometimes starts as diffused large
[5]B-cell lymphoma and sometimes it becomes diffused
[6]large B-cell lymphoma from a different type of
[7]lymphoma. So it could be some indolent lymphomas.
[8]And I wrote this in my background on NHL in my
[9]expert report. Some indolent lymphomas transform
[10]into the large cell lymphoma at a rate of about 5 to
[11]10 percent per year after initial diagnosis.
[12]Q. Right. And this isn't the other example.
[13]There are other kinds of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that
[14]transform into different types as well?
[15]A. That is correct. So there is this
[16]transformation thing.
[17]So, really, all that I meant by this is
[18]that this -- the fact that I talked about diffused
[19]large B-cell lymphoma, it's fair to acknowledge that
[20]this could have evolved from something else I just
[21]don't know about.
[22]Q. Okay.
[23]A. I am not aware of a particular study that
[24]looked specifically at the evolution per se, because
[25]to do that you will need to have a cohort of
  Page 279
[1]patients who have indolent lymphoma, all of them,
[2]and you expose all of them to glyphosate. And then
[3]you follow them prospectively and see what's the
[4]percentage of these folks that transform into large
[5]cell lymphoma. I think we both can agree that this
[6]can't happen.
[7]Q. Right.
[8]A. So, you know, that's really all that I
[9]meant by this statement.
[10]Q. And all day, sir, you and I have been
[11]talking about your expert opinion and details of
[12]your expert opinion that glyphosate is causally
[13]associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in general.
[14]And all I'm asking right now is whether you intend
[15]to testify, to a reasonable degree of medical
[16]certainty, that you have evidence that glyphosate
[17]causes NHL transformation or development in
[18]addition.
[19]A. It can. Every case is different, as I
[20]said, you cannot rule it out; you cannot rule it in.
[21]So if you have somebody who has indolent
[22]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whatever that disease is,
[23]and you just spread them with glyphosate for the
[24]next five days and then the disease transforms to
[25]something else, can you rule out glyphosate could
  Page 280
[1]have may caused this? You can't.
[2]So I think every case is different. So,
[3]you know, your first question was is there evidence
[4]that specifically looked at this? I am not aware of
[5]that, but that doesn't take away that it could
[6]actually happen in a particular case. I'll have to
[7]look at the particular clinical scenario, the
[8]particular patient, the particular situation where I
[9]can really provide you with an accurate medical
[10]opinion.
[11]Q. And you know of no evidence -- no
[12]scientific evidence that that happens as a general
[13]proposition; correct?
[14]A. For the general population, no. But it
[15]could happen in some patients. So every case is
[16]different. I'm going to say that again for the
[17]third time. Every case is different.
[18]So, yes, glyphosate, if it's exposed to
[19]somebody who has indolent disease, could transform
[20]into an aggressive disease. You can't say no. But
[21]I don't have a population base study to say that,
[22]you know, the risk of transforming from an indolent
[23]to an aggressive lymphoma is 15 percent with
[24]glyphosate. I don't have that.
[25]Q. Do you know the difference between the
  Page 281
[1]terms "general causation" and "specific causation"?
[2]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[3]A. Would you explain to me, please.
[4]Q. Sure. When I use the term, sir, what I
[5]mean by "general causation" is evidence that a
[6]particular substance can cause or does cause a
[7]particular outcome in general.
[8]A. Okay.
[9]Q. So all day today we've been talking about
[10]your general causation opinion that glyphosate --
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. -- can cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[13]Specific causation means an opinion by
[14]someone that this particular substance caused this
[15]patient's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or caused some
[16]event like the transformation of a particular
[17]patient's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Okay?
[18]A. Okay.
[19]Q. Okay. So -- and I'm trying to understand
[20]what you just told me. Is it -- is what you're
[21]telling me that you can have -- without evidence
[22]of -- without general causation evidence that
[23]glyphosate can cause a transformation of
[24]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from one type to another or
[25]an evolution or development of stages, that you
  Page 282
[1]could nevertheless testify in a particular case as
[2]to specific causation, that although -- although I
[3]don't have scientific evidence that glyphosate
[4]causes transformation, I can testify that it's my
[5]opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical
[6]certainty, that it did in this particular patient?
[7]A. Yes, I can. I might.
[8]Q. Have you ever formed such an opinion for
[9]anyone?
[10]A. Formed an opinion of what?
[11]Q. That glyphosate caused a transformation?
[12]A. I reviewed a case that -- right --
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: That was just prognostics.
[14]A. Prognostics. Just provided an opinion in
[15]terms of the prognosis of the actual --
[16]MR. LITZENBURG: Yeah, they have your
[17]declaration.
[18]A. Right.
[19]Q. So you are talking about the D. Johnson
[20]case?
[21]A. Yeah. That's what I just provided --
[22]Q. The Dewayne Johnson case?
[23]A. Yes. That's really the only thing that I
[24]looked at from a prognostication standpoint.
[25]Q. I'm not just talking about in connection
  Page 283
[1]with this litigation.
[2]A. No, I am not.
[3]Q. I'm talking your clinical practice as well,
[4]sir.
[5]Have you ever formed the opinion that
[6]glyphosate caused a -- caused a patient with
[7]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of a particular type to
[8]transform to another type --
[9]A. In my practice I have -- in my practice, I
[10]have not had that. In my personal practice, I have
[11]not seen -- I have not had a patient that had
[12]indolent lymphoma that had glyphosate and then
[13]subsequently changed. I have not had that sequence
[14]of events.
[15]Q. Okay. Outside of your practice, have you
[16]done that?
[17]A. How would I do that outside my practice?
[18]Q. Mr. Litzenburg just said that you did a
[19]prognostic thing with Dewayne Johnson --
[20]A. Yeah. I looked at the case from a
[21]prognostic standpoint. I was asked to take a look
[22]at the case and provide an opinion in terms of the
[23]life expectancy.
[24]Q. And I know about that.
[25]Did you form an opinion about
  Page 284
[1]transformation?
[2]A. I did not.
[3]Q. Okay. The meta-analysis by -- oh, I'm
[4]sorry. We didn't quite finish with the --
[5]A. Sure.
[6]Q. -- Schinasi and León meta-analysis here. I
[7]now understand the terms that you used in that
[8]sentence, that it solidifies a plausible association
[9]between glyphosate and NHL evolution and
[10]development.
[11]What did the Schinasi and León
[12]meta-analysis add to the evidence that you were
[13]weighing in reaching the conclusions that you did,
[14]sir?
[15]A. I mean, I think the -- we both have
[16]acknowledged, in all of the studies that we
[17]reviewed, that there are limitations to any one
[18]individual study. I mean, I think, you know, we can
[19]all pick each study apart and realize the
[20]limitations. And what the meta-analysis attempts to
[21]do is to overcome some of these limitations by
[22]looking at the aggregate evidence, by looking at all
[23]of these studies together.
[24]So I think the -- you know, when you look
[25]at this particular meta-analysis, it showed an odd
  Page 285
[1]ratio of 2.0 with a confidence interval between 1.1
[2]and 3.6. So, to me, it really showed that when you
[3]look at the data in combination of everything
[4]together, you might be able to demonstrate
[5]statistical significance because you're able to look
[6]at everything combined. You try to overcome the
[7]limitations of each individual study. So you have
[8]larger numbers. You have larger denominators,
[9]larger cases, larger controls, et cetera.
[10]So really that's -- that's what this
[11]meta-analysis gave me, that when you looked at the
[12]combined evidence, the odds ratio was significant
[13]and there's an association and causality between
[14]glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[15]Q. And what does it mean to you to have a
[16]meta-analysis that, in your opinion, yields a
[17]statistically significant result?
[18]A. It means that there is an association and
[19]causality between what the authors were looking at
[20]and the disease they were looking at.
[21]Q. Okay. And did you not have that conclusion
[22]before you saw the meta-analysis, that there was an
[23]association and causality?
[24]A. Well, I did, but you need to have -- you
[25]need to solidify your opinion. Again, you know, I
  Page 286
[1]didn't look at one paper -- if I looked at one paper
[2]in isolation, I may not have had that conclusion.
[3]And so you look at all of the papers, the
[4]meta-analysis, the additional information, to form
[5]the opinion. So I -- you know, my opinion is not
[6]formed based on each isolated paper. It's really
[7]based on the aggregate collection of evidence.
[8]Q. Okay. Now, since we talked about each one
[9]of these individual papers --
[10]A. Right.
[11]Q. -- what did the meta-analysis tell you that
[12]you had not learned by looking at each of the
[13]individual papers?
[14]A. It showed a statistical significance that
[15]some of these papers did not have that. As you
[16]articulated earlier, some of them did cross the 1.
[17]So at least this -- this odds ratio of 2.0 not
[18]crossing the 1 is significant, and it overcomes some
[19]of the limitations that the previous individual
[20]studies suffered from.
[21]Q. Now I want to ask you about the Chang and
[22]Delzell meta-analysis and what the Chang and Delzell
[23]meta-analysis added to your assessment of the
[24]evidence. And maybe it's the same as what Schinasi
[25]and León did.
  Page 287
[1]A. If you are going to ask me about the actual
[2]data inside --
[3]Q. Okay.
[4]A. If it's just about my report, it's fine.
[5]Q. Well, let's try from your report.
[6]A. Sure. So, again, it has a risk ratio of
[7]1.3 and original studies, which report PubMed,
[8]Google Scholar, with additional references that were
[9]found in the bibliography of review articles.
[10]Collectively, 19 articles were included, as well as
[11]one abstract and one letter to the editor. When
[12]analyzing NHL by subtype, the risk ratio for B-cell
[13]was 2.0, for CLL 1.3, follicular 1.7, and no
[14]increase over HL, Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[15]Q. You said "Notably, no increased risk for
[16]Hodgkin's lymphoma was done." Why was that notably?
[17]A. I need to quit the "notably." That's one
[18]of my writing skills I need to work on. I use a
[19]lot --
[20]Q. You shouldn't say "notably" so much?
[21]A. I've been told I say notably, surprisingly.
[22]I'm -- you know -- I'm working on that.
[23](Laughter.)
[24]Q. All right. I'll leave you alone about it
[25]now.
  Page 288
[1]A. When I get reviewers usually asking me, why
[2]is this notably?
[3]Q. The overall risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[4]was 1.3 with a confidence interval at -- the lower
[5]bound was at 1.0, which would not be statistically
[6]significant; correct?
[7]A. It's borderline, I would say.
[8]Q. And then you broke it up by subtype.
[9]A. Well, they broke it up.
[10]Q. B-cell -- well, you --
[11]A. Right.
[12]Q. -- listed their breakdown.
[13]A. I just listed their breakout, and they
[14]have -- yeah.
[15]Q. B-cell 2.0, CLL 1.3, and follicular
[16]lymphoma 1.7. And two of those were not
[17]statistically significant and one was, sir.
[18]Do you have the opinion that the
[19]epidemiological evidence shows a difference in the
[20]manifestation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma across
[21]subtypes based on exposure to glyphosate?
[22]A. Yeah. I don't think there's sufficient
[23]evidence, frankly, to have robust conclusions based
[24]on 60 subtypes, and I don't think it's honestly
[25]doable. It's impossible. And I think we alluded to
  Page 289
[1]this earlier this morning.
[2]Q. And everyone who's tried to stratisfy
[3][sic], of course, has not gone to 60; they've gone
[4]to 3 or 4 like this B-cell.
[5]A. Yeah. It's very difficult. Right? I
[6]mean, follicular lymphoma is a form of B-cell, for
[7]example. But they try to look at alone. CLL is,
[8]quote/unquote, a form of B-cell lymphoma, although
[9]it's leukemia.
[10]So I think it's very difficult to look at
[11]the subtypes because there are so many right now.
[12]And because of the heterogeneity but also because of
[13]the fact that, in order for you to be convinced of
[14]the subtypes, you need to have pathologic
[15]confirmation of each particular patient, each
[16]particular subtype. And many patients don't even
[17]know what type of lymphoma they have. They just
[18]say, I have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. So it's just a
[19]very difficult exercise to do.
[20]Q. On page 18 of your expert report, you
[21]talked about -- when you were talking about the EPA
[22]SAP panel review, you mentioned that the panel
[23]recommended that the EPA talk to the AHS, the
[24]Agricultural Health Study investigators, to
[25]determine whether updated data on incidence of NHL
  Page 290
[1]and other cancers are available.
[2]And why did you put that in your expert
[3]report?
[4]A. I think, you know, it's -- it's -- one of
[5]the things that we have to acknowledge about the
[6]limitation of the Agricultural Health Study. It is
[7]the only prospective study in my review that I was
[8]able to find, but it does have limitation with the
[9]short follow-up time of 6.7 years. And many of the
[10]patients in the Agricultural Health Study were
[11]younger versus patients who are diagnosed usually
[12]with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 70 percent were
[13]younger than the age of 70, 46 percent were younger
[14]than the age of 50.
[15]So I think it was important to highlight
[16]this limitation and the fact that the EPA wanted to
[17]get a follow-up, if available, and published.
[18](Nabhan Exhibit 23 marked for
[19]identification.)
[20]Q. Sir, do you know who Aaron Blair is?
[21]A. Aaron Blair -- is he IARC? No, he is --
[22]the names are starting to blur a little bit.
[23]Q. Aaron Blair was the chief investigator for
[24]the Monograph 112.
[25]A. Okay. Yes. IARC.
  Page 291
[1]Q. He headed it up.
[2]A. I was right for a change.
[3]Q. And he is on the Agricultural Health Study
[4]as well.
[5]A. Yes, correct.
[6]Q. You see his name on the front of this
[7]draft, March 15, 2013, draft on lymphoma risk and
[8]pesticide use in the Agricultural Health Study;
[9]correct?
[10]A. He's one of the coauthors, yes.
[11]Q. Have you seen this document before?
[12]A. I have never seen this document before.
[13]Q. Okay. Let's take a look at it. This was a
[14]document, sir, that I'll represent was produced and
[15]marked as an exhibit at the deposition of Aaron
[16]Blair --
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. -- where he produced it as additional
[19]follow-up data that was available on glyphosate and
[20]other exposures from the Agricultural Health Study?
[21]A. So this is an actual paper that was
[22]published somewhere?
[23]Q. It was not published, sir. It was a draft
[24]that was never published. And we'll talk about that
[25]too.
  Page 292
[1]A. Okay. I'm just -- I thought I would have
[2]seen it if it was published. Okay.
[3]Q. Yes. If it had been published, you would
[4]have seen it.
[5]So the 213 draft manuscript was published
[6]with additional data -- five additional years of
[7]data, as you can see from page 3; correct?
[8]A. Yes, I see five years later, '98 to '04.
[9]Okay.
[10]Q. You see a discussion on page 9 of follow-up
[11]questionnaires being given, additional data was
[12]collected? Page 9, sir. I'm looking at the middle
[13]of the --
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. -- page numbers at the bottom of the middle
[16]of the page.
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. "So follow-up questionnaires were given and
[19]a data-driven multiple-imputation procedure was
[20]used, where there were -- where there were not
[21]responses."
[22]Do you see that?
[23]A. The middle paragraph, "A follow-up
[24]questionnaire" --
[25]Q. Yes, sir.
  Page 293
[1]A. -- "which ascertained pesticide usage
[2]enrollment was administered about five years after
[3]enrollment and completed by 63 percent" -- so not
[4]everybody -- "of the original participants."
[5]Q. Right.
[6]A. Okay. "And for participants who did not
[7]complete a Phase 2 questionnaire, a data-driven
[8]multiple-imputation procedure" -- what does that
[9]mean in English, "a data-driven multiple-imputation
[10]procedure"?
[11]Q. Well, it's a statistical method to figure
[12]out what the results would have been for the
[13]procedure -- for the questionnaires that were not
[14]returned based on the data that was provided.
[15]A. Well, you could critique this right away.
[16]Okay. That's fine. I mean, ultimately --
[17]Q. Take a look at the results on page 12, sir.
[18]A. Only 63 percent answered. Okay. Page 12.
[19]Okay.
[20]Q. Do you see that it says "The risk of
[21]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma increased significantly, and
[22]in near-monotonic fashion with age in the age S
[23]cohort."
[24]It's the very first sentence, under
[25]"Results."
  Page 294
[1]A. Oh.
[2]So what do they mean by "monotonic
[3]fashion"? This is the first time I hear this --
[4]Q. Oh, monotonic, sir, in statistics means
[5]that as age increases --
[6]A. Oh, I see. Linear type of thing?
[7]Q. As a stepwise linear progression, yes.
[8]A. Okay. I mean, I'm not really sure that the
[9]linear thing, that we are 100 percent certain with
[10]occupational hazards, but that's fine. That's what
[11]they're saying. Okay.
[12]Q. Okay. And, I mean, that's about what you
[13]would expect. You would expect that as age
[14]increases, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[15]would also increase; right?
[16]A. Agree. I just -- I don't know if it's
[17]linear. That's what I'm saying. Okay.
[18]Q. And I don't mean it's in a straight line --
[19]A. That's why --
[20]Q. I mean every age cohort, as it goes up, you
[21]have more non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. You would agree
[22]with that?
[23]A. I agree with that.
[24]Q. Okay. "And the number of livestock on the
[25]farm and whether cohort members" -- I'm looking at
  Page 295
[1]the end that paragraph -- "whether cohort members
[2]drove farm equipment with diesel engines
[3]significantly increased risk of non-Hodgkin's
[4]lymphoma."
[5]Does that make sense given what you know
[6]about the causes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on the
[7]farm, sir?
[8]A. Well, I mean, this one is looking at the
[9]number of livestock. I mean, so it's not just
[10]farming. They're trying to correlate the number of
[11]livestock with the increased risk. So I --
[12]obviously, I know that there is data on farmers and
[13]increased risk. I wasn't aware that the number of
[14]livestock correlates with increase of NHL.
[15]Q. It would increase exposure to a number of
[16]things, including animal viruses; right?
[17]A. I get that, but I didn't realize -- I mean,
[18]again, I'm not aware of data that the number -- so
[19]if you have five cattles versus ten, I didn't know
[20]that the ten necessarily increased risk by -- versus
[21]five. Just the fact that you have more number, it
[22]doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have more
[23]exposure to particular pathogens.
[24]It may appear this way, but unless you have
[25]actual -- what they're saying here is it does. So,
  Page 296
[1]I mean, again, that's what they're saying.
[2]Q. Okay. Yeah. Right. They said that it
[3]does.
[4]A. But all of this is new to me, so . . .
[5]Q. Yes, sir.
[6]Go to page 17, the middle paragraph.
[7]A. Okay.
[8]Q. And I'm looking at the last sentence in
[9]that paragraph. "In our study, we could not
[10]evaluate MCPA, but found no excess risk of NHL or
[11]its subtypes with the use of glyphosate" --
[12]A. I'm sorry. Where are you looking? Page
[13]17?
[14]Q. The last sentence --
[15]A. Last sentence.
[16]Q. -- in the middle paragraph on page 17,
[17]starting "In our study."
[18]Do you see that?
[19]A. This is page 17. I don't see "In our
[20]study." Where is it? Oh, here it is. That second
[21]paragraph.
[22]Okay. I see it.
[23]Q. "In our study, we could not evaluate MCPA,
[24]but found no excess risk of NHL or its subtypes with
[25]the use of glyphosate, 2,4-D, or 2,4,5-T."
  Page 297
[1]Do you see that, sir?
[2]A. I see that.
[3]Q. Okay. I know that, as you said, all this
[4]is new to you.
[5]Now let's turn to the data tables.
[6]A. I mean, you do recognize there are so many
[7]comments on the side that I have not seen; right?
[8]Q. Oh, yes. I know, sir.
[9]A. Okay. Which -- where do you want me to go
[10]now?
[11]Q. Let's go to page 31 first.
[12]A. Okay.
[13]Q. Table 2.
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And this is "Pesticide exposure, lifetime
[16]days and intensity-weighted lifetime days, and the
[17]age-adjusted risk of NHL incidence, 1993 to 2008.
[18]So what this is is -- it's the same as the table we
[19]looked at in DeRoos 2005, the published AHS data
[20]with five less -- five fewer years that looked at
[21]lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime days
[22]with the new data in; right?
[23]A. Okay.
[24]Q. If you go to page 34, you see the data for
[25]glyphosate.
  Page 298
[1]A. (Speaking sotto voce.)
[2]Okay. I just want to pull the DeRoos
[3]paper. Which one is -- okay.
[4]Q. So we looked earlier at the DeRoos 2005
[5]paper, which you've expressed a criticism of, that
[6]there wasn't enough follow-up in terms of years of
[7]follow-up, sir.
[8]And we looked at the table in which
[9]lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime days
[10]were assessed and saw that, in that table, there was
[11]no association between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's
[12]lymphoma. I believe you testified that you could
[13]not use that table to support a hypothesis that
[14]glyphosate causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; correct?
[15]A. You're talking the DeRoos '05; right?
[16]Q. Yeah.
[17]A. I said that, yes.
[18]Q. Okay. So this is the corresponding table,
[19]sir, in the Alavanja 2013, the 2013 AHS data.
[20]MR. LITZENBURG: I object to the
[21]representation.
[22]Q. On page 34, do you see that they show
[23]glyphosate at no exposure, low exposure, medium
[24]exposure and high exposure levels for lifetime days
[25]and intensity-weighted lifetime days?
  Page 299
[1]A. Yeah, but I -- I'm struggling in
[2]understanding how it is related to the Table 3 of
[3]DeRoos '05 in terms of the tertile. So in the
[4]DeRoos '05, Table 3, the first tertile is 1 to 20,
[5]the second tertile, 21 to 56. The other one is 57
[6]to 2678.
[7]I don't know how they're representing this
[8]here. They have none; low, 20; medium, 67.5; and
[9]high, 173.25. I don't know what these numbers mean.
[10]Q. Well, breaking it into three even tertiles
[11]would depend on what kind of underlying data you
[12]have.
[13]A. Well --
[14]Q. How the tertiles break out.
[15]A. -- I understand that, but the tertiles were
[16]years of use multiplied by the -- right? In the
[17]DeRoos '05, they had the cumulative lifetime days of
[18]use or cumulative exposure days, years of use
[19]multiplied by days per year categorized in
[20]tertile -- in tertiles among users, from 1 to 20,
[21]et cetera.
[22]So did they use the same thing here?
[23]Because the numbers are different than the numbers
[24]here.
[25]Q. Yes, sir. They broke it into three even
  Page 300
[1]tertiles. And what constitutes an even tertile
[2]depends on the actual exposures of each individual
[3]in the tertile.
[4]A. My question is, these numbers between
[5]parentheses, if -- Table 34, low, medium, and high,
[6]what do these numbers represent? You have 20,
[7]65.75, 173.25. What are these numbers?
[8]Q. Those are a measure of days of exposure and
[9]intensity-weighted days of exposure.
[10]But my question is about the point
[11]estimate, sir, in the second and third columns.
[12]A. I just wanted to make sure we're comparing
[13]apples to apples. That's all. Okay.
[14]Q. In this chart in exhibit -- what exhibit is
[15]it? -- 23. Table 2, "Pesticide exposure, lifetime
[16]days and intensity-weighted lifetime days," there is
[17]no association between glyphosate and
[18]intensity-weighted or non-intensity-weighted
[19]lifetime days of exposure; correct?
[20]A. This table shows no association.
[21]Q. Okay.
[22]A. I would like to review this paper in more
[23]detail. But it's not a paper; it's not published.
[24]Q. On page 36, you see Table 3, "Pesticide
[25]exposure, lifetime days, and the age-adjusted risk
  Page 301
[1]of NHL by cell type."
[2]A. I see that, yes.
[3]Q. And then we have a breakdown of four
[4]different groupings of NHL types; correct?
[5]A. Uh-hum.
[6]Q. And then on page 39, you see the data for
[7]glyphosate. And for all the subtypes, there was no
[8]association in the data in this study; correct?
[9]A. Yeah, it does not seem that there is an
[10]association here based on this data.
[11]Q. Page 53, there is a supplemental Table 2
[12]entitled -- I'll wait until you're there.
[13]A. I'm there.
[14]Q. Entitled "Pesticide exposures, total days
[15]and intensity-weight total days, fully adjusted
[16]risks of NHL incidence, 1993 to 2008."
[17]On page 59, we see the data. And, again,
[18]there is no association in these data, correct,
[19]between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[20]A. In this data as presented, you're correct.
[21]But this paper requires way too much review than
[22]this, and I -- it's, like, 70-page paper.
[23]Q. I wish you'd reviewed, sir.
[24]A. Well, I -- it's not in the published
[25]literature.
  Page 302
[1]Q. On page 66, Supplemental Table 3,
[2]"Herbicide exposures, lifetime days, and
[3]age-adjusted NHL risk by cell type, 1993 through
[4]2008."
[5]A. Which page, sir? Which page are you on?
[6]Q. Page 66.
[7]A. Okay. Yep.
[8]Q. The data is on page 69 for glyphosate.
[9]And, again, there is no association between
[10]glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in this data
[11]as reported; correct?
[12]A. I don't see an association here based on
[13]the data that is represented.
[14]Q. Supplemental Table 7 on page 84, sir,
[15]"Pesticide exposures, total days, and
[16]intensity-weighted total days, age-adjusted risks of
[17]NHL incidences, 1993 through 2008." On page 91 is
[18]the glyphosate data. And, again, there is no
[19]association between glyphosate and NHL in the data
[20]as presented here; right?
[21]A. Page 91?
[22]Q. Yes, sir.
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. So I'm correct that there was no
[25]association?
  Page 303
[1]A. As depicted in this table, you're correct.
[2]Q. Let's go back to page 34 to get some sense
[3]of how much larger this cohort is, sir.
[4]A. Okay.
[5]Q. So page 34, again, is the glyphosate data
[6]for lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime
[7]days. And the first column, after "none, low,
[8]medium, and high" gives the N, the number in each of
[9]those categories; right?
[10]A. Uh-hum.
[11]Q. So there were 70 people with no exposure to
[12]glyphosate who had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 89 with
[13]low exposure, 78 with medium, and 83 with high;
[14]correct?
[15]A. This is correct.
[16]Q. So 250 exposed cases compared to 94 from
[17]DeRoos 2005; right?
[18]A. In DeRoos '95 -- 2005 at 29, 1 to 20; 15,
[19]that's 44; and 17, that's 61, according to this
[20]table.
[21]Q. This is a much larger cohort?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Okay.
[24]A. I still would like to understand the
[25]methodology, how they actually grouped these
  Page 304
[1]patients. So if you can just show me how they
[2]grouped them, because they are being grouped
[3]differently between DeRoos '05 and this paper. But
[4]there's so much corrections on it, that it's very
[5]difficult to even tease out.
[6]Q. Yes, sir.
[7]There is a draft paper with comments on it.
[8]A. Well, there are obviously a lot of comments
[9]that requires revision. And, clearly, there is so
[10]much corrections that are needed.
[11]Q. We've discussed earlier that Aaron Blair,
[12]who is the head of IARC and on the Agricultural
[13]Health Study, had his deposition taken in this case
[14]and that you haven't read that deposition; right?
[15]A. I have not.
[16]Q. Okay.
[17]And Dr. Blair at his deposition, when he
[18]was asked what the ever/never statistics would be
[19]from this study, the Alavanja 2013, admitted that it
[20]would be less than 1, it would be that 0.9 point
[21]estimate.
[22]Did you know that, sir?
[23]MR. LITZENBURG: I'm going to object to
[24]that characterization. You don't need to
[25]listen to any representation he makes about a
  Page 305
[1]deposition transcript he hasn't seen -- or he
[2]hasn't shown you.
[3]A. I don't know.
[4]MR. LITZENBURG: You can answer the
[5]question if you want to --
[6]A. I did not know that.
[7]MR. LITZENBURG: -- with that caveat on the
[8]record.
[9]Q. And, sir, did you know that Aaron Blair
[10]admitted that the meta-relative risk for NHL that
[11]was calculated by IARC, where he was presiding,
[12]would probably not have been statistically
[13]significant if IARC had had this data?
[14]MR. LITZENBURG: Same objection.
[15]A. I know nothing of what Aaron Blair has ever
[16]said.
[17]Q. If that were true, sir, if IARC had had the
[18]2013 data and calculated a meta-analysis that was
[19]not statistically significant, that was, in fact,
[20]near 1, how would that affect your opinion that
[21]glyphosate --
[22]MR. LITZENBURG: Same objection.
[23]Q. -- can cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[24]A. I think we both know that we don't know the
[25]answer to that. I think it would be critical, if
  Page 306
[1]this type of literature is sound and good, it would
[2]be submitted for rigorous peer-review process to a
[3]respectable journal for peers to look at. If it's
[4]written in 2013, and it's -- four years later, it
[5]has not been published, then there are clearly some
[6]issues in it that, to this date, has not been
[7]published.
[8]Having said that, until it's published,
[9]peer-reviewed, and go through the process, all of
[10]the information here in my -- has nothing to do with
[11]my opinion or testimony.
[12]Q. Is that because you have a policy of not
[13]reviewing unpublished literature?
[14]A. Well, how am I supposed to find this? If
[15]it's not reviewed, I mean, how am I supposed to find
[16]this type of literature?
[17]Q. It's in your hands now, sir.
[18]A. You want me to review a 75-page document in
[19]five minutes?
[20]Q. Is this something that you're going to
[21]weigh in forming your opinions about non-Hodgkin's
[22]lymphoma and glyphosate now that you have it?
[23]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[24]A. If it is not in the peer-reviewed
[25]literature that is published and been subjected to a
  Page 307
[1]rigorous peer-review process, I will not rely on it.
[2]Q. Why?
[3]A. I think it's self-explanatory. I mean, I'm
[4]not going to rely --
[5]Q. Go ahead.
[6]A. -- on an opinion -- if a scientist has an
[7]opinion that is valid, they usually submit that
[8]opinion to a journal, to a peer review, so it could
[9]actually be looked at and evaluated.
[10]Q. Do you know that Mr. Blair and his
[11]colleagues -- Dr. Blair and his colleagues discussed
[12]publishing this before IARC so that IARC would be
[13]able to consider it and chose not to do so and has
[14]testified to that effect?
[15]MR. LITZENBURG: I'm going to object again
[16]about representations about Aaron Blair's
[17]testimony and . . .
[18]A. I know nothing of what Aaron Blair did,
[19]said, or -- I have not looked at what he actually
[20]said, and I don't know what his opinion is in this
[21]matter.
[22]Q. If this data were valid, if it -- if this
[23]could be written up and published and present these
[24]same data that we just looked at showing no
[25]association, how would that, as a published paper,
  Page 308
[1]affect your opinion on glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's
[2]lymphoma?
[3]A. Well, I think --
[4]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form, and asked
[5]and answered.
[6]Go ahead.
[7]A. The fair thing is really for the IARC to
[8]relook at things. And now there is additional
[9]evidence, and they probably have to relook at things
[10]and see whether this solidifies the evidence
[11]further, not solidify the evidence further. It's
[12]hard to tell, because, again, you have to remember
[13]that the evidence is not just based on one or two
[14]papers; it's based on the totality of evidence.
[15]There is a lot of epidemiologic literature.
[16]There is some meta-analysis. There is some
[17]genotoxicity studies. We talked about some animal
[18]studies, et cetera.
[19]So it's really not one thing that's going
[20]to sway the pendulum one way or the other. And I
[21]think you've asked me several times, if this study
[22]was reviewed or not reviewed, how would your opinion
[23]change. And it's impossible to answer this, because
[24]I'll have to put my mindset into a situation that I
[25]don't have evidence I already looked at. And it's
  Page 309
[1]hard to do that because I already saw that evidence
[2]and I looked at and I critiqued it.
[3]So I think if this paper ever makes it to
[4]light and gets published and peer-reviewed in a
[5]journal, then it should be looked at like all other
[6]journals that we looked at. I think the importance
[7]of a peer review is that -- so this paper, you know,
[8]would be sent to -- to folks who understand this
[9]type of literature. It would be subjected to a
[10]statistic -- the rigor of statistics. A
[11]statistician would review the methodology, a
[12]toxicologist, et cetera, an epidemiologist. And
[13]they would provide comments and do the things.
[14]I mean, you could tell, frankly, just from
[15]the draft that you gave me -- I mean, it's kind of
[16]funny, frankly. Let's see how many comments there
[17]are already that's outstanding. I mean, you know,
[18]there's over 50 to 60 comments that, you know,
[19]from -- no, I take it back. 77. Look how many
[20]comments there are of certain outstanding things
[21]that are still not resolved in the author's opinion.
[22]That tells me they are way far from even getting
[23]close to agreeing on what this paper means.
[24]77 comments on page 83. That's the last
[25]thing. Many of the comments are Aaron Blair
  Page 310
[1]himself.
[2]Q. If they chose not to publish this because
[3]they didn't want IARC to come to a conclusion other
[4]than what IARC came to, would you think that was
[5]scientifically proper?
[6]MR. LITZENBURG: Object to form.
[7]A. If they -- if they chose not to publish it
[8]intentionally, you mean?
[9]Q. If they chose not to publish this because
[10]they didn't want IARC to have this data because it
[11]might influence IARC to find that glyphosate was not
[12]associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, do you think
[13]that's scientifically proper?
[14]MR. LITZENBURG: Same objection.
[15]A. Yeah, I wouldn't agree to not publishing
[16]this for the sole purpose of affecting a committee
[17]review. If it were me, I would not withhold
[18]information for that sole purpose.
[19]I can't speak as to why it is not
[20]published. I mean, what you're telling me is
[21]Dr. Blair has testified to the content of the data.
[22]So, clearly, he is willing to share that data
[23]with -- in the public domain. So I believe that the
[24]reason a paper like this is not published is the
[25]fact that it has a lot of methodological issues that
  Page 311
[1]they're trying to go through.
[2]There's -- again, this is -- the draft that
[3]you gave me is 12/5/16, almost a year old. And it's
[4]one of those studies that has a lot of issues that
[5]they're trying to address. And I think they're
[6]struggling in addressing them. That is my honest
[7]opinion when I look at a draft like this that's been
[8]sitting on the shelf for a year with 77 comments on
[9]it.
[10]But, if it were me, I would not withhold
[11]information just so I would affect a committee
[12]decision. But that's me.
[13]Q. Were you provided with any -- you have
[14]looked at several depositions in this case; right?
[15]A. I have.
[16]Q. Which ones?
[17]A. I looked at Dr. Neugut, Dr. Saltmiras. I
[18]think I read his deposition.
[19]MR. LITZENBURG: I think there's a list at
[20]the end of your --
[21]Q. Well, you list -- in your expert report,
[22]you listed Donna Farmer, David Saltmiras, and
[23]William Heydens.
[24]A. And Neugut as well.
[25]Q. Okay. And Neugut. And that's it?
  Page 312
[1]A. Yeah.
[2]Q. How did you even know about those
[3]depositions?
[4]A. The -- Tim forwarded them to me.
[5]Q. Okay. You said earlier that you found all
[6]of the scientific literature that you relied on for
[7]your expert report and listed under documents
[8]reviewed by Dr. Nabhan yourself; is that right?
[9]A. I have researched that myself, yes.
[10]Q. Okay. Were any of those sent to you by
[11]counsel for plaintiffs?
[12]A. When I struggled in finding particular
[13]information, I reached out. And they were able to
[14]help me if I struggled in finding some of those --
[15]Q. Okay. So if you asked for a particular
[16]article, they sent it to you?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Otherwise, they didn't send you anything in
[19]particular?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. And the depositions and exhibits they chose
[22]to send you, the four that you have listed?
[23]A. It's the second -- it's the other way
[24]around. I -- even before I accepted this, I did a
[25]lot of literature myself to decide whether I can do
  Page 313
[1]this or not. And, again, I did my literature
[2]search. But if I struggled sometimes in finding
[3]some of the information, they -- I reached out, and
[4]I was provided some help.
[5]Q. Yes, I'm asking about something different
[6]now. I've moved on from the scientific literature.
[7]A. Oh.
[8]Q. I'm talking about the depositions now.
[9]A. Oh, the deposition --
[10]Q. For those, they chose what to send you; is
[11]that right?
[12]A. Yes. They were -- I didn't have a choice.
[13]Q. Yes, sir.
[14]And anything that was unpublished that
[15]plaintiffs' counsel may have or know about, you
[16]didn't get that from them? You didn't hear about it
[17]from them or get it from them, like this Alavanja --
[18]A. I reviewed whatever they sent me, plus I
[19]reviewed a lot of things on Google and CNN. It's
[20]very easy to search and see what's going on.
[21]Q. This MON-GLY production, MON-GLY 01314233,
[22]et seq -- et seq means "and so on." Right?
[23]A. I don't know. Which one is this?
[24]Q. Do you see what I'm talking about?
[25]A. I see what you're saying, yeah.
  Page 314
[1]Q. These are -- these would be Monsanto
[2]documents?
[3]A. Yes, I have reviewed -- I don't know which
[4]one is this, but I have reviewed some of the
[5]documents that were not necessarily papers that were
[6]sent to me by the plaintiff.
[7]Q. Okay. And was it -- how large of a volume
[8]was it?
[9]A. I think this may -- I don't remember which
[10]one is this.
[11]MR. LITZENBURG: I don't know what it is.
[12]A. I'll have to get back to you on that. I
[13]really don't know. I don't know.
[14]Q. Did you review a whole box of documents --
[15]A. No, no, no, no.
[16]Q. -- or a little stack or what?
[17]A. It's probably 10 pages or 12 pages.
[18]Q. Okay. So this was one particular Monsanto
[19]document, and you --
[20]A. Probably a couple of documents. Probably a
[21]couple of documents.
[22]Q. And then IARC Monograph 112, how did you
[23]find that one?
[24]A. I think I -- this is one of the things that
[25]I asked for help to get the actual monograph, and I
  Page 315
[1]reviewed. But I reviewed the paper myself, the
[2]Guyton paper.
[3]Q. And then the EPA SAP panel, final minutes
[4]and report, how did you have the idea to get that
[5]and read it?
[6]A. I've asked the plaintiff for that.
[7]Q. Did you know about it from your own
[8]research and ask them to get it for you?
[9]A. Yeah, yeah. I've asked to see the last one
[10]as possible.
[11]Q. And are there any other documents that you
[12]considered important in forming your opinions that
[13]aren't listed on these two pages, Attachment B to
[14]your expert report, sir?
[15]A. Not for this particular report, no.
[16]Q. Other than the --
[17]A. But you have to add the Neugut deposition,
[18]just to be accurate.
[19]Q. Yes, we discussed it. So it's -- it's on
[20]the record, sir.
[21]Other than the declaration that you did in
[22]the Dewayne Johnston [sic] case, have you done other
[23]expert reports on the subject of glyphosate in any
[24]way?
[25]A. I have not.
  Page 316
[1]MR. GRIFFIS: Let's take a five-minute
[2]break.
[3]VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record at
[4]4:40 P.M.
[5](Recess taken from 4:40 P.M. to
[6]4:52 P.M.)
[7]VIDEOGRAPHER: And we are back on the
[8]record at 4:52 P.M.
[9]MR. GRIFFIS: I'm going to stop my
[10]questioning now and reserve the rest of my time
[11]for redirect. And Mr. Litzenburg is going to
[12]ask some questions.
[13]MR. LITZENBURG: Thank you. I do have a
[14]few questions in follow-up. I'm going to work
[15]backwards, so it will be a little awkward, and
[16]I apologize for that up front.
[17]EXAMINATION
[18]BY MR. LITZENBURG:
[19]Q. Let me start out by asking the opinions
[20]you've given today, do they have anything to do with
[21]Cardinal Health or with your employment with
[22]Cardinal Health?
[23]A. No, they're not. They're my individual
[24]opinion. My employer bears no opinion on this case
[25]whatsoever.
  Page 317
[1]Q. And we are compensating you, but that's on
[2]an individual basis, has nothing to do with your
[3]company; is that right?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. Okay. We discussed some depositions today.
[6]Well, let me back up.
[7]You have stated today over and over again,
[8]and on many levels, your opinion as to general
[9]causation. You understand that term now as we are
[10]using it, general causation?
[11]A. Yes, I do.
[12]Q. Okay. Does -- that opinion of general
[13]causation, does that depend on any of these
[14]depositions as a basis for that -- for forming that
[15]opinion?
[16]That's a terrible question. Let me ask it
[17]again.
[18]Did you have to rely on any of these
[19]deposition transcripts in order to form that
[20]opinion?
[21]A. No. I formed this opinion based on my
[22]research of the available evidence, the published
[23]literature, as well as my own expertise and treating
[24]patients with lymphoma for over 17 years.
[25]Q. Okay. So your opinion didn't change with
  Page 318
[1]what Dr. Neugut said at his deposition or what was
[2]written in the transcript of Dr. Neugut's
[3]deposition; is that fair?
[4]A. No, it did not.
[5]Q. Okay. I'm going to briefly -- again, we
[6]will work in reverse -- ask you a couple questions
[7]about this Exhibit 23.
[8]First of all -- well, we spent a lot of
[9]time on the record. But, generally, do you have any
[10]idea what this is?
[11]A. Well, I saw it for the first time today.
[12]Q. Uh-hum.
[13]A. I'm being told that this is an unpublished
[14]data on the Agricultural Health Study.
[15]Q. Did you review -- what other sets of
[16]unpublished data did you review for your opinion
[17]today?
[18]A. I just reviewed, you know, the EPA as well
[19]as some of the depositions, but everything else I
[20]reviewed and I relied upon was published in
[21]peer-reviewed journals.
[22]Q. Okay. And so you drew a line at
[23]peer-reviewed published data in order to review for
[24]basing your opinion on; is that fair?
[25]A. I think it's very important for anything
  Page 319
[1]that is looking at situations like this to be
[2]reviewed by experts in the field and in the
[3]literature, because if it withstands the rigor of
[4]the peer-review process, then it just holds -- it
[5]holds more scrutiny that I would look at more
[6]critically and I will take more seriously.
[7]Q. Did I ask you or any of my colleagues ask
[8]you to review any other draft papers?
[9]A. No, you have not.
[10]Q. Did you ask me to provide you with any
[11]draft papers to form your opinion?
[12]A. No. The only thing I asked you about was
[13]the EPA report.
[14]Q. Does this even look like a final draft to
[15]you?
[16]A. It looks like an awful draft, in my humble
[17]opinion.
[18]Q. But, I mean, does it look like it's final
[19]form, ready for submission to any peer --
[20]A. Not even close.
[21]Q. Okay. And I think you noted that these
[22]comments were authored comments, in other words,
[23]coauthors speaking to each other; is that correct?
[24]A. Coauthors speaking to each other. It's
[25]very difficult to know what each author is saying to
  Page 320
[1]each person. There's a lot of information that
[2]needs to be looked at, lots of -- this is just, you
[3]know, a very, very preliminary draft that is also
[4]one year old. The last it was looked at was
[5]December 2016, and the data was almost four years
[6]old.
[7]And I don't think that it would withstand,
[8]frankly, the scrutiny of peer-review process when
[9]you lose 40 percent follow-up. I think that's
[10]really why the authors can't even submit it
[11]anywhere.
[12]Q. Well, let's take that one step at a time.
[13]Tonight is, again, the first time you've
[14]ever seen this document; is that fair?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. And I don't want to get down in the weeds
[17]and examine all of the analyses and statistical
[18]power, et cetera, of this draft paper, but you
[19]had -- you said at the beginning that you had --
[20]yeah, that you can critique this right away. And
[21]then you mentioned something about follow-up.
[22]Would you very briefly and concisely let us
[23]know what you're talking about there?
[24]A. Well, when you look at the -- at page 9, it
[25]says, "A follow-up questionnaire which ascertained
  Page 321
[1]pesticide usage enrollment was administered about
[2]five years after enrollment, completed by
[3]63 percent."
[4]So you have almost 40 percent loss of
[5]follow-up with the second phase. And this
[6]application of impute likely -- you know, stratified
[7]sampling was employed to impute likely use of
[8]specific pesticide seems to me like an exercise to
[9]overcome a challenge. And that exercise will never
[10]stand the test of rigorous peer-review process.
[11]Q. Fair to say that statistics we're dealing
[12]with today and you deal with in your job have to do
[13]with public health, cancer?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Okay. Does -- and you take -- is it fair
[16]to say that you try to take a more conservative
[17]approach with statistics when you're looking at
[18]matters of public health or life and death?
[19]A. Of course.
[20]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form.
[21]Q. Okay. Does imputing 40 percent of data, is
[22]that an appropriate or conservative approach when
[23]looking at human cancer?
[24]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form.
[25]Foundation.
  Page 322
[1]A. No. The answer is you cannot really forego
[2]40 percent of lack of follow-up.
[3]Q. We can set that aside for now, that draft
[4]paper, if you would, Doctor.
[5]Now, setting that aside and getting back to
[6]all the published literature that we spoke about for
[7]the rest of the day, are any of those studies
[8]perfect that we talked about today?
[9]A. I don't believe any study is 100 percent
[10]perfect. I don't believe such a thing actually
[11]exists in epidemiology literature.
[12]Q. So while you have reached a conclusion
[13]regarding general causation, there is not a single
[14]paper that you would hold out and say, "This is the
[15]perfect paper and by itself provides this evidence
[16]100 percent"?
[17]A. I don't --
[18]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form. Leading.
[19]A. I don't believe that any paper is perfect
[20]that I reviewed.
[21]Q. Okay. There was -- give me a minute.
[22](Pause.)
[23]Q. There were some quotes read to you from a
[24]IARC monograph question-and-answer. And that was
[25]not given -- provided to you, and I don't have a
  Page 323
[1]paper copy either. But I'm going to read you
[2]another quote from that same document.
[3]"Group 2A means that the agent is probably
[4]carcinogenic to humans. For agents in this
[5]category, there is usually convincing evidence that
[6]the agent causes cancer in laboratory animals and
[7]some evidence that it could cause cancer in humans,
[8]but the evidence is humans is not conclusive."
[9]Do you agree with that statement -- do you
[10]agree with IARC's classification of glyphosate as a
[11]2A agent?
[12]A. I do.
[13]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form.
[14]Q. There's some discussion of hazard versus
[15]risk, hazard being absolute and risk being a
[16]measurement. Is that the way that you understood
[17]the discussion?
[18]A. That's the way that it was phrased to me.
[19]Q. Okay. And so we have seen IARC's decision
[20]as to whether or not this was a carcinogen. That's
[21]been discussed at length today; right?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. And we've also discussed, probably more so
[24]of the day, a quantification of excess risk that's
[25]been made by various models; is that fair?
  Page 324
[1]A. Yes.
[2]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form.
[3]Q. And that would be the risk portion of the
[4]hazard and risk delineation; right?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form. Leading.
[7]Q. There were some questions about, you know,
[8]what -- trying to pin you down, I think, about, you
[9]know, what is the true increase in risk.
[10]Epidemiology is the study of increase in
[11]risk across populations; is that fair?
[12]A. That is epidemiology.
[13]Q. Okay. It's not -- there is no one number
[14]for how much a person's risk is increased by
[15]exposure to something, these are all population
[16]subsets we're talking about today; is that fair?
[17]A. That is fair.
[18]MR. GRIFFIS: Just continued objection to
[19]form. Leading.
[20]Q. There was one question -- well, I won't try
[21]to quote it verbatim. There was a question asking
[22]you to point to a single statistically significant
[23]positive result controlling for other pesticides.
[24]We did look at some other issues above 1
[25]that controlled for other pesticides today; is that
  Page 325
[1]correct?
[2]A. Yes, we did.
[3]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form. Leading.
[4]Q. And then when the meta-analyses -- the two
[5]meta-analyses that you reviewed that were published
[6]took into account the various odds ratios and
[7]powers, did they reach statistical significance?
[8]A. Yes, they did.
[9]Q. And those -- okay.
[10]Let's look at Eriksson, 2008. Maybe 18?
[11]A. Which one is it?
[12]Q. Eriksson 2008.
[13]A. Is it 19, you said?
[14]Q. I'm sorry. It's 18.
[15]A. Okay.
[16]Q. If I wrote it down right.
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. There was criticism of numbers -- well,
[19]results are reached in these papers where the
[20]confidence interval crossed 1 by counsel today.
[21]Do you remember questions like that?
[22]A. I do.
[23]Q. Okay. If you look at Table 4, we spent
[24]some time looking at that. And these are all
[25]different herbicides or classes of herbicides; is
  Page 326
[1]that correct?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. And defense counsel asked you to count up
[4]all the ones with an odds ratio above 1.
[5]Do you remember that question?
[6]A. I do.
[7]Q. Nearly all of them, however, have a
[8]confidence interval which crosses 1; is that
[9]correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. Okay. We can set that aside for now.
[12]Well, I'll just ask you a follow-up.
[13]Have you done -- have you done any studies
[14]on whether any other herbicide causes non-Hodgkin
[15]lymphoma today?
[16]A. I did not.
[17]Q. And so you don't know if controlling for a
[18]specific herbicide or a group of herbicides in a
[19]given city would cause an odds ratio to go up, down,
[20]or what it would do to the statistical significance;
[21]is that fair?
[22]A. That's fair.
[23]Q. Let's look at -- there was a question about
[24]a failure of these papers to find a dose response.
[25]Let's look at McDuffie, if we can. And we'll just
  Page 327
[1]have a race to see who figures out which exhibit it
[2]was first.
[3]I think it was the first published paper
[4]that was marked.
[5]A. I think McDuffie is Exhibit 11. It's
[6]Exhibit 11.
[7]Q. Yeah. If you would look at page 1160 with
[8]me.
[9]A. Okay.
[10]Q. And in the second paragraph on that page,
[11]starting with Table 8, the authors in this published
[12]McDuffie paper concluded that they demonstrated a
[13]dose-response relationship for glyphosate.
[14]Do you see that in the final sentence of
[15]that paragraph?
[16]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form. Leading.
[17]A. I see that.
[18]Q. I'll ask it a different way.
[19]Did the authors of McDuffie put in this
[20]published paper whether or not they've -- they
[21]demonstrated a dose-response relationship with
[22]glyphosate and NHL?
[23]A. They did.
[24]Q. Okay. And was that -- did they find such a
[25]response relationship or not?
  Page 328
[1]A. They did.
[2]Q. What is -- I think this was hinted at
[3]today, but I want to give you a chance to explain
[4]it. Is there a problem with using farmers as the
[5]control groups in these epidemiological studies?
[6]A. I mean, I wouldn't say it's a problem, but
[7]I think, given the fact that farmers have an
[8]inherent increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's
[9]lymphoma, your control group already has a high bar.
[10]So demonstrating a statistical significant above and
[11]beyond that in a case -- in the actual individuals
[12]affected becomes more harder.
[13]And that's why you would still take an odds
[14]ratio as a hypothesis generating that you would look
[15]at despite the fact that it crosses the 1, because
[16]your control group already is establishing a much
[17]higher bar that you have to overcome.
[18]Q. Okay. This is going to make my head hurt,
[19]but there was -- there was a comparison of logistic
[20]and hierarchical regression or something like that.
[21]Do you remember that today? Do you have
[22]any reason --
[23]A. Vividly.
[24]Q. Do you have any reason to believe that the
[25]logistic regression method is inferior to
  Page 329
[1]hierarchical?
[2]A. I honestly -- as I said, this require a
[3]statistician to answer the question. I don't think
[4]I'm qualified to even know the difference between
[5]logistic regression and hierarchical regression.
[6]I've always, I believe -- and that's really the
[7]value of peer review, that you have to --
[8]statisticians would look at that.
[9]As a clinician, I don't understand quite
[10]the nuances in terms of differences between both
[11]methodologies.
[12]Q. Okay. But do you -- well, we'll leave it
[13]at that.
[14]A. I don't believe it would alter my opinion
[15]per se.
[16]Q. Let's look at -- we talked a lot about odds
[17]ratios and a fair amount about confidence intervals,
[18]but let's go to Exhibit 12, if you would.
[19]A. Okay. It's the Hardell paper.
[20]Q. Yes. And we had two marked, so make sure
[21]it's Hardell 2002.
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Okay. And I want to look at Table 1.
[24]A. Okay.
[25]Q. And so, for example, glyphosate has an odds
  Page 330
[1]ratio of 3.04. In lay terms -- and I think we've
[2]all dealt with epidemiology a lot and there's a
[3]potential for a lay person to see this -- what does
[4]an odds ratio mean exactly?
[5]A. Sorry?
[6]Q. Leaving alone the numbers. I'm sorry.
[7]What exactly is an odds ratio? How would
[8]you explain it to a lay person?
[9]A. I mean, I would say an odds ratio is
[10]basically the fact that the exposure to a particular
[11]offending agent increases the risk above and beyond
[12]other factors, above and beyond the control.
[13]Q. Okay. And so just taking this as an
[14]example, in Table 1 of Hardell, there is an odds
[15]ratio -- and it is statistically significant -- for
[16]glyphosate; is that correct?
[17]A. Yes. It's 3.04, and it's -- the confidence
[18]interval 1.08 to 8.52.
[19]Q. Okay. Now, just using it as an example, to
[20]a lay person, does that mean, then, it raises the
[21]risk by 3 percent? What does that mean?
[22]A. It means it raises the risk only by
[23]30 percent.
[24]Q. Is it a tripling?
[25]A. No, it's not by 30 -- it's threefold.
  Page 331
[1]That's what it means.
[2]Q. So a tripling of the risk?
[3]A. So -- yes. I mean, exposure to glyphosate
[4]will triple the risk compared to somebody who is not
[5]exposed. So you're increasing the risk by
[6]threefold, by that number, by 3.04.
[7]Q. Okay. And the confidence interval, you
[8]talked about some of the arbitrariness of the P
[9]values, but we've essentially selected confidence
[10]intervals to mean that we could be confident to a
[11]95 percent degree that the true value is within this
[12]range. Is that a fair representation?
[13]A. Yes. So 95 percent of the values fall
[14]between those two numbers.
[15]Q. Okay. So what we can tell here when we
[16]look at the confidence intervals for glyphosate is
[17]we could be 95 percent that it goes from 1.08 to as
[18]high as 8.52; is that fair?
[19]A. That is absolutely correct.
[20]Q. So just in this table alone, it's possible
[21]that the real result is underreported and could be
[22]800 percent; is that right?
[23]A. Could be 8 -- I mean, in some -- in some
[24]folks, it could be eightfold increased risk. And
[25]the lowest it could be is 1.8 -- 1.08-fold.
  Page 332
[1]Q. Okay. And I won't go through all the
[2]papers. There are many of those that we've looked
[3]at today, but those are what those bounds of the
[4]confidence interval mean when we look at individual
[5]results; is that right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Okay. You talked about -- you talked about
[8]age, the increased risk of cancers with increasing
[9]age. Do you remember that discussion earlier today?
[10]A. Yes, I do.
[11]Q. And I think you said something along the
[12]lines of -- that one reason for that is it could be
[13]a proxy for larger cumulative exposures; is that
[14]fair?
[15]A. Yeah.
[16]Q. Could you explain that a little more.
[17]A. Well, I mean, I think the -- the -- you
[18]know, as we go through life, our bodies are exposed
[19]to a variety of environmental, dietary factors, some
[20]of them that we know they are carcinogen, some of
[21]them we don't. And then, as the body ages, there
[22]are lots of cellular disruptions that occur. And
[23]when you add insult to injury, older folks become at
[24]higher risk of developing certain cancers. So, I
[25]mean, cancer ultimately is a disease of older
  Page 333
[1]patients.
[2]Q. Okay. But being 60 doesn't cause cancer.
[3]Is that a fair way to say it?
[4]A. No, just because you're -- I think you
[5]just -- you have a higher risk just by virtue of the
[6]fact that, as you age as a person, the cellular
[7]mechanisms just are altered. So, I mean, age -- you
[8]could -- you could make a blank statement and say
[9]age is a risk factor for every single cancer under
[10]the sun, and you would be correct.
[11]Q. But a person that's 80 has had more insults
[12]to their cells and their DNA than somebody who is
[13]10; is that fair?
[14]A. Right. Exactly.
[15]Q. Okay. If age is controlled for in some of
[16]these -- we talked a lot about controls. And,
[17]again, I think we all know what we're talking about
[18]in here, but in case a lay person sees this at any
[19]point, if a epidemiological study controls for age
[20]and, say, comes up with an odds ratio of 2, that
[21]means that if you take a group of people that are
[22]the same age, they may be elderly and at increased
[23]risk, and you take a group of the same people and
[24]expose them to the agent, that they still have a
[25]doubling of the risk; is that correct?
  Page 334
[1]A. Yes. If you control for the age, that's
[2]correct.
[3]MR. GRIFFIS: Excuse me. Objection to
[4]form. Leading.
[5]Q. Well, let me ask again a different way.
[6]What does it mean to control for age in an
[7]epidemiological study?
[8]A. Well, you do your best to take out age as a
[9]contributing factor for both the cases and the
[10]controls. So you want to try to eliminate age as a
[11]confounding factor so you can go back. Well, the
[12]only reason that these folks have non-Hodgkin's
[13]lymphoma is simply because they're older.
[14]So you control for this factor so you
[15]eliminate that as a possible contribution.
[16]Q. And is it -- controlling is -- well, let me
[17]withdraw that.
[18]A. You do this statistically through
[19]regression modeling, where you just control for some
[20]of these factors that you can control for. I mean,
[21]age in general is easy to control for because you
[22]have it available. But there are lots of factors
[23]that you would like to control for that you can't.
[24]Q. You talked about modifiable risks and
[25]modifiable etiologies. And, again, I want to make
  Page 335
[1]sure that anybody can understand this today.
[2]Tell me what significance a modifiable risk
[3]or etiology has to you as a clinician.
[4]A. Well, you know, the -- you could make an
[5]argument -- and it would be a valid argument -- that
[6]the best way to actually -- that the best drug that
[7]we have ever had for cancer is smoking cessation as
[8]an example. It has had the absolute highest risk
[9]reduction possible. It is not an innovative
[10]therapy. It's very inexpensive, it's cheap, and et
[11]cetera, et cetera.
[12]So identifying risk factors that are easy
[13]to eliminate from the environment to affected
[14]individuals is very valuable. And it's very
[15]important for us as clinicians, because you can take
[16]one factor out, and then you would reduce the risk.
[17]And I bring tobacco as an example because
[18]it's easy to understand for a lot of people. Even
[19]in somebody who has a diagnosis of a particular
[20]cancer, and they say, "Well, I have cancer now; I
[21]can smoke all I want," the fact is if you stop
[22]smoking, you reduce the risk of a secondary cancer
[23]because now your body was more predisposed to the
[24]first one individual cancer.
[25]So, you know, environmental factors are
  Page 336
[1]important for us to identify because it helps
[2]patients at the end.
[3]Q. And in your clinic you can recommend to
[4]patients, based on your understanding of these
[5]factors, to avoid certain ones to try to avoid
[6]recurrence or progression of the disease?
[7]A. Absolutely.
[8]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection. Leading.
[9]Q. There was some brief discussion about
[10]latency. And I appreciate that -- well, it was my
[11]understanding that you said basically it depends on
[12]a lot of different factors. Is that -- is that --
[13]let me withdraw that question.
[14]What was your overall answer to the
[15]questions about what's a latency period for
[16]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma today?
[17]A. As I said, I think that it is very
[18]difficult -- it's a very gray area. It is very
[19]difficult to have a binary decision on a latency
[20]period and say you have to have 10 years of exposure
[21]or 5 years of exposure or 15 years of exposure
[22]before you develop cancer. It's just not the way
[23]real life works.
[24]So I think that latency period does exist.
[25]I think it varies between individual patients and
  Page 337
[1]other contributing factors, how often they get
[2]exposed to an offending agent, et cetera.
[3]So I don't believe short latency period or
[4]long latency period should -- should be a factor.
[5]It was not a factor in me deciding that there's a
[6]causality between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's
[7]lymphoma.
[8]Q. Okay. So you could find causality with a
[9]latency period of significantly shorter than ten
[10]years as well as significantly longer that ten
[11]years? Is that --
[12]A. Absolutely.
[13]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection. Leading.
[14]A. And I said that previously for sure.
[15]Q. Let's take modifiable risk factors as an
[16]example. Do you need to know the mechanism of
[17]action of those risk factors in order to apply them
[18]to your clinic?
[19]A. No. And, in fact, there are many things
[20]that we -- you know, we told people not to smoke
[21]before we even know how in the world nicotine or
[22]tobacco cause cancer, and we probably still don't
[23]know exactly how it happens.
[24]So I think knowing the mechanism of action
[25]is good, is nice. I think it would be nice to have
  Page 338
[1]a plausible mechanism of action to better understand
[2]as a scientist. I think it's always nice. But it's
[3]not an absolute. It's not really necessary to know
[4]that.
[5]And, similar to this, we know many drugs
[6]that work against cancer. And we don't always
[7]understand the exact mechanisms by which these drugs
[8]work against cancer. But we know from clinical
[9]trials that they do. And there is usually some
[10]basic science studies to suggest that they could
[11]work.
[12]So I think it's nice to know some mechanism
[13]of action to have this plausibility between -- and
[14]association, but it's not mandatory to fully
[15]understand.
[16]Q. I was going to say, do you feel comfortable
[17]prescribing drugs to cancer patients where you're
[18]not sure of the exact mechanism of action?
[19]A. We do it all the time, as long as it's
[20]supported by clinical trials that show the activity
[21]and they're FDA approved.
[22]Q. Let's look at -- yeah, let's look at
[23]Exhibit 6, if we can.
[24]A. 6?
[25]Q. Yeah. That's not right.
  Page 339
[1]A. That's the monograph?
[2]Q. No, that's not right. Let me see if I can
[3]find it.
[4]There was --
[5]A. Which paper?
[6]Q. Let me see if I can find it. What do you
[7]have for 5? I don't have a 5.
[8]A. 5 is the Greim paper, 4 is the Engels
[9]paper, and 6 is the IARC monograph.
[10]Q. Let me see if I turned the number upside
[11]down, 7.
[12]A. The Smith paper?
[13]Q. Yes. And that's something you --
[14]A. Sure.
[15]Q. Is this something you saw for the first
[16]time today?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Okay. And we looked at -- it doesn't say
[19]anything about glyphosate; correct?
[20]A. No.
[21]Q. We looked at a bunch of different
[22]characteristics, key characteristics of carcinogens.
[23]Do you remember that and see that in that paper?
[24]A. It's proposed characteristics.
[25]Q. Okay.
  Page 340
[1]A. These authors are trying to propose
[2]characteristics that need to be satisfied to
[3]establish carcinogenicity.
[4]Q. Okay. And there's ten. In order for
[5]something to cause cancer, does it have to have all
[6]ten of these characteristics?
[7]A. Nope.
[8]Q. Okay. Are there known carcinogens that
[9]lack some of these characteristics?
[10]A. Yes, but I can't name anything right now.
[11]Q. Let's -- let's confine the discussion of
[12]glyphosate to . . .
[13]Just to make a clear record, I gave you the
[14]rough draft of Dr. Neugut's deposition transcript;
[15]is that correct?
[16]A. Yes, it was un -- it had a lot of typos.
[17]Q. Okay. And I haven't given you the final?
[18]A. No.
[19]Q. You haven't reviewed that yet?
[20]I'm sorry. I think we've harped on this a
[21]couple times today, but explain to me why we can't
[22]draw different -- why we can't draw firm conclusions
[23]about the etiologies of the various subtypes of
[24]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from the literature that's
[25]been produced to date.
  Page 341
[1]A. So it's actually very difficult because you
[2]have so many types of lymphomas. I mean, there are
[3]probably 60 types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that we
[4]currently are aware of. So you will have to design
[5]study of thousands of patients that -- to have
[6]sufficient numbers of every single histology to be
[7]able to demonstrate the association, causality, and
[8]statistical significance. That's one reason.
[9]The second reason is that the types of
[10]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have changed over the years.
[11]So the way we know -- we classify lymphoma today is
[12]very different than the way we classified lymphoma
[13]in 1995. So it depends where the study was done, it
[14]becomes very difficult to know this.
[15]And, lastly, in a case-control study, you
[16]are relying on the answers of individuals that
[17]oftentimes they really don't know the subtypes. I
[18]mean, I have cared for thousands of patients. And
[19]they know they have lymphoma. Sometimes they don't
[20]know if it's Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin.
[21]So there are many situations where a
[22]patient may not know that what he or she has is
[23]large-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mycosis
[24]fungoides, et cetera. So I think it becomes very
[25]difficult to establish that.
  Page 342
[1]Q. And, in fact, some of the papers -- one of
[2]the papers we looked at today had only, like, eight
[3]exposed cases that were -- that were -- we were
[4]drawing conclusions off of. Do you -- is that
[5]correct?
[6]A. I recall that. I think maybe the Eriksson
[7]paper. I don't remember which one.
[8]Q. Okay. Certainly, in a cohort of eight,
[9]we're not going to have every subtype represented;
[10]right?
[11]A. That's correct.
[12]Q. Even in a cohort of 50, we're not going to
[13]be able to draw statistical conclusions about the
[14]etiologies of subtypes and how they differ; is that
[15]right?
[16]A. Impossible. You have 60 subtypes. I mean,
[17]it's just -- it's just not -- it's not possible.
[18]Q. Let's find the Greim paper. It's an
[19]early -- I think you found it when I gave you the
[20]wrong number a minute ago.
[21]A. Yes, it is -- it's Exhibit 5.
[22]Q. And there was some discussion of -- well,
[23]number one, one of these authors in the
[24]corresponding authors, you pointed out, is a vice
[25]president at Monsanto; correct?
  Page 343
[1]A. I don't know his title, but he is a
[2]Monsanto employee.
[3]Q. Okay. And you see Christian Strupp there
[4]is a member of -- do you see the 6 number by his
[5]name?
[6]A. Yes. He is part of the glyphosate task
[7]force.
[8]Q. Okay. And I'll represent to you that he
[9]also works for a company that makes glyphosate.
[10]Does that -- does that further give you a
[11]grain of salt with respect to this paper?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. I am going to represent to you that I've
[14]found the date of publication in this journal to be
[15]March 16th of 2015 in Critical Reviews of
[16]Toxicology. Assuming that this was published on
[17]March 16th, 2015, and the IARC meeting was March 3
[18]to March 10, 2015, can you see a reason why the IARC
[19]panel did not look at this paper?
[20]A. I can.
[21]Q. Okay. And what would that be?
[22]A. It wasn't available in the peer-reviewed
[23]literature at the time of the IARC meeting.
[24]Q. Okay. Now, some things are published in
[25]advance online. There's sometimes differing
  Page 344
[1]publication dates for --
[2]A. Sometimes, yeah. It depends on the journal
[3]and the article.
[4]Q. Okay. Some of these papers that we went
[5]through today and we looked at in your -- that were
[6]mentioned in your -- well, let me back up. The
[7]majority of the papers that you looked at were ones
[8]that you found in your own literature research;
[9]right? Not sent by me --
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. -- or my colleagues? Okay.
[12]And you looked at a number of papers and
[13]you mentioned a number of papers that did -- were
[14]not what we would call positive papers for
[15]associations of glyphosate --
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. -- and NHL; correct.
[18]Is that because you -- let me see. So --
[19]A. I think it's fair to be -- to represent the
[20]evidence in its totality. I mean, I think, you
[21]know, my -- my goal, when I looked at this evidence,
[22]was not only to cite papers that were positive. I
[23]don't think it would be fair, and I wouldn't do
[24]that. I wanted to present as balanced of a review
[25]as possible and as balanced of a testimony as
  Page 345
[1]possible. So I looked at all of the evidence, and I
[2]did not shy away from explicitly citing evidence
[3]that was not significant. I think it's fair.
[4]Q. That was my question, is you didn't go out
[5]just looking for positive papers in order to form
[6]your opinion; right?
[7]A. No. I looked at all of the papers.
[8]Q. And I think there was some question of why
[9]did you mention some papers in your report that
[10]didn't reach positive association. Is that just in
[11]fairness or --
[12]A. I think that is the appropriate way of
[13]reviewing the literature and looking at the
[14]literature.
[15]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection to form. Leading.
[16]I'm having to object after you answer,
[17]because you are answering just a little fast,
[18]sir.
[19]Q. There was, again, a delineation made
[20]between hazard and risk and IARC and its conclusions
[21]versus what was called real-world human exposure a
[22]couple of different times.
[23]While IARC makes its classification of
[24]whether something is of a possible or probable human
[25]carcinogen -- you're familiar with that process and
  Page 346
[1]those classifications; right?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. And they draw a line between probable and
[4]possibly; correct?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. And they put glyphosate in that -- in that
[7]former group of probable. Okay. And in order to
[8]look -- we've called that the hazard assessment.
[9]You're familiar with that discussion today?
[10]A. Yeah. We -- we've had an exhaustive
[11]discussion on that.
[12]Q. The Q&A from IARC and all that.
[13]Now, the literature review -- there was a
[14]question about real-world human exposures and risk
[15]assessments.
[16]Does the epidemiological literature give a
[17]feel for real-world human exposures?
[18]A. To the extent possible, it does.
[19]Q. I mean, that's not measuring enormous doses
[20]of some chemical in a lab; right?
[21]A. No. They're just looking at what really
[22]happens in real life. I mean, they take cases and
[23]controls and so forth. It's not -- they're not
[24]necessarily trying to -- you can't because it's
[25]really retrospective. So you're just looking at
  Page 347
[1]what's happening in the real world to the extent
[2]possible. And despite the limitations, it's a good
[3]representation in general.
[4]Q. Okay. I think we used the terms "clinical
[5]significance" or "clinically significant" and
[6]"statistical significance" a few different points
[7]today.
[8]Can you explain, to the best you can, what
[9]the differences between those two is for you?
[10]A. So statistical significance is a pure
[11]number. Right? It's, you know, a P value of less
[12]than 0.05, it says that the findings are -- could be
[13]related to chance in 5 percent of the cases, but we
[14]are 95 percent certain that they are not related to
[15]chance. However, these findings may not really
[16]impact your practice. You may not find them
[17]clinically significant.
[18]And I think for those of us who have done
[19]this for a long time are always -- can cite so many
[20]papers that show the P value of less than 0.05 that
[21]meant nothing.
[22]A pure example was published in the New
[23]England Journal of Medicine, the most prestigious
[24]journal in the world, in a study, randomized trial,
[25]prospective trial in patients with metastatic
  Page 348
[1]pancreatic cancer. They were -- they had two arms.
[2]They were compared prospectively. It was
[3]probably -- it's probably included close to 7, 800
[4]patients. The conclusion of that paper, the
[5]experimental arm that had the novel agent improved
[6]overall survival with a P value of less than 0.0 --
[7]less than 0.05 -- it was actually probably 0.01 --
[8]by 1.5 weeks.
[9]So how often do you believe this novel
[10]agent was used in real life? Not often. And I
[11]think these are examples where you can see certain
[12]things that, based on numbers -- you have enough
[13]numbers, you will see a P value less than 0.05 but
[14]may not be clinically significant.
[15]At the same time, there are situations that
[16]you may not see that P value, you may not see the
[17]0.05, but you see a trend, and you kind of know, if
[18]you had enough numbers, you were going to see
[19]something significant.
[20]So if you take just a small study, 50
[21]versus 50, and you see a trend, you will know that,
[22]if you just had hundred versus hundred, you were
[23]going to reach that P value.
[24]So I think it's very important for us, as
[25]clinicians and researchers, not to take -- not to
  Page 349
[1]just, you know, hold everything on a P value that is
[2]just a simple number, you know. And I can assure
[3]you that statisticians will have a lot of creative
[4]ways to make the P value significant. I call it
[5]funny accounting.
[6]Q. And so -- and I think you've just answered
[7]this, but there are things that are statistically
[8]significant that are not clinically significant to
[9]you?
[10]A. And vice versa.
[11]Q. And vice versa. Okay.
[12]Now, you've said either today or you've
[13]said to me at some point recently that you find
[14]positive studies to be more important than negative
[15]studies. Is that fair?
[16]A. I think it's fair, especially in situations
[17]like this. I mean, you know, if you see -- you
[18]start -- your baseline start is a negative
[19]association. Right? So if you say that this
[20]compound is not associated with this cancer, that's
[21]really the null hypothesis, if you will. That's
[22]really where you're starting from. So if you really
[23]confirm your null hypothesis, okay, that's great.
[24]But if you see a positive association, no
[25]matter how small it is, it is very important to
  Page 350
[1]report for two reasons. Number one, you did not
[2]know about that association before; but, number two,
[3]you have to look at the impact on a population
[4]basis.
[5]You know -- you know, yes, your trial may
[6]have included a couple hundred patients who have had
[7]eight or ten cases. Let's multiply that now by
[8]thousands, thousands, hundreds of thousands in the
[9]U.S., outside the U.S., in Europe, in Asia, in
[10]Australia. All of a sudden you see an epidemic that
[11]is very important for us to identify.
[12]So all of what these small studies are
[13]trying to tell us is there's something there. You
[14]better act on it before it's too late and we see
[15]more patients with this disease.
[16]Q. I'm going to ask you a hypothetical sort of
[17]about all those numbers that we've looked at today.
[18]Imagine if we had taken away the discussion of
[19]statistical significance, those confidence
[20]intervals, and all the things that we've taken
[21]today. The vast majority of results in all of these
[22]papers today, nearly all of them were above 1; is
[23]that correct?
[24]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection. Leading.
[25]A. That's correct.
  Page 351
[1]Q. Okay. And so if something truly doesn't --
[2]you are familiar with what a forest plot is?
[3]A. I am familiar with forest plot.
[4]Q. Okay. So in a forest plot, if you were
[5]plotting all of those results and you had a center
[6]line of 0, those will all be on the right or
[7]positive side of that line; right?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection. Leading.
[10]Q. And if you -- if something truly didn't
[11]cause cancer at all, you'd expect to see results
[12]of -- suggesting it was cancer protective, an amount
[13]of -- first of all, it's on the left side of that
[14]line too; is that fair?
[15]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection. Leading and
[16]foundation.
[17]A. I'm not sure about cancer protective. I
[18]would say it would be negative association with
[19]cancer. It would be on the left side or crossing
[20]the middle -- mid line, but I wouldn't go as cancer
[21]protective.
[22]Q. But here what we're seeing is a lot of
[23]results on the right side of the line, just not all
[24]of them reach the P value that statisticians have
[25]decided is the confidence interval that we use as a
  Page 352
[1]standard?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]MR. GRIFFIS: Objection. Counsel is
[4]testifying, not the witness.
[5]Q. You said earlier today -- we were talking
[6]about different -- differing between the subtypes.
[7]You said that some types have -- their causes remain
[8]unknown or they're unknown.
[9]Are you talking about abstract subtypes of
[10]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or do you mean particular
[11]clinical presentations of particular patients?
[12]A. No. We know enough about how patients
[13]present and how to treat them and the prognosis, I
[14]think we've done a great job in understanding
[15]subtype, subtypes of lymphoma, as well as
[16]prognostication.
[17]We do a good job in treating the disease;
[18]we can always do better. But I think I meant by
[19]saying is that we -- it's very difficult to
[20]subclassify in these studies every particular trial
[21]to go look at the subtypes. And I already, I think,
[22]outlined why that is the case.
[23]Q. And that was -- so you said you disagreed
[24]with a quote that was read about etiological
[25]heterogeneity among NHL subtypes.
  Page 353
[1]Is that that topic that we've just
[2]discussed?
[3]A. We discussed that. I think it's very --
[4]you cannot just have one etiologic factor that
[5]affects one type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, not the
[6]other. I don't think we are able to say that at
[7]this point. There are some types -- some subtypes
[8]of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that we can actually tell
[9]what's causing them, but we don't have that for
[10]every single subtype.
[11]And I think, if my memory serves me right,
[12]I provided an example as HIV that causes several
[13]types of lymphoma. And there are many other
[14]examples I could give, but at the same time, we
[15]don't have causation for every type.
[16]Q. Okay. You figured out the particular
[17]histological subtype of a person's lymphoma. Does
[18]that give you more information about its etiology as
[19]a clinician, or does that give you more information
[20]about the treatment and prognosis of that disease?
[21]A. More, really, treatment than prognosis.
[22]Like I said, for some subtypes you can talk about
[23]the etiology and you -- you always try. You always
[24]ask questions about occupational exposure, family
[25]history, all of these things, viral association,
  Page 354
[1]et cetera. But the reality, as a clinician, this
[2]really aids more in prognosticating as well as
[3]recommending treatment option.
[4]Q. There was a question toward the
[5]beginning -- you see I'm getting almost to the very
[6]beginning -- about what you could add to a
[7]toxicologist or an epidemiologist in terms of
[8]expertise on this issue.
[9]You are and have been, for most of your
[10]career, a clinician; correct?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. Okay. And what disease do you specialize
[13]in?
[14]A. Lymphoid malignancies and a little bit of
[15]prostate cancer.
[16]Q. Do you consider yourself an non-Hodgkin's
[17]lymphoma specialist?
[18]A. I would say lymphoma specialist, because I
[19]do take care of Hodgkin as well. When I was at the
[20]University of Chicago, I would see close to 50
[21]lymphoma patients a week, at least five to six new
[22]patients a week. So, I mean . . .
[23]Q. Doctor, do you -- do you rely on
[24]epidemiology in your interpretation of it in both
[25]your clinical and your academic realms?
  Page 355
[1]A. To the extent possible. I mean, I look at
[2]the literature. I understand the literature. I'm
[3]not an epidemiologist, but I can understand
[4]epidemiology papers with -- with their limitations
[5]and their strengths. So I think I -- I rely on them
[6]somewhat. I wouldn't say they are the sole thing I
[7]rely on.
[8]Q. Okay. At the very beginning, there was a
[9]question about when you last treated a cancer
[10]patient. I think you said it was around 11 months
[11]ago; is that correct?
[12]A. That is correct.
[13]Q. To be very clear, you're not offering any
[14]opinions on the standard of care of a medical
[15]oncologist; is that correct?
[16]A. No, but I can.
[17]Q. Let's not.
[18]A. I -- I continue to write in the area and
[19]lecture in the area. And I -- in fact, I'm giving a
[20]big seminar on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the
[21]American Society of Hematology in December. It will
[22]get at least 3 to 400 people in attendance. So I
[23]continue to work in the field.
[24]Q. Completely aside from your business
[25]practice?
  Page 356
[1]A. Yes. And a lot of the papers that I have
[2]and continue to submit are in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[3]and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, so . . .
[4]Q. Doctor, we've been here now for eight hours
[5]or more, and defense counsel has given you a lot of
[6]new things and a lot of arguments.
[7]Has anything today knocked you off your
[8]opinion that exposure to glyphosate can cause
[9]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[10]A. No.
[11]Q. Do all the opinion -- opinions that you've
[12]put in your report here stand at the end of this
[13]deposition?
[14]A. They do stand.
[15]MR. LITZENBURG: Okay. I have nothing
[16]further at this time. I may have some in
[17]follow-up.
[18]EXAMINATION
[19]BY MR. GRIFFIS:
[20]Q. Doctor, what will your seminar at the
[21]American Hematological Society be about?
[22]A. Updates on lymphoma and CLL.
[23]Q. What about? Will you be updating people on
[24]all of the important literature since --
[25]A. I'm chairing a panel. I'm chairing a panel
  Page 357
[1]with three other people. So each one of us will
[2]actually give a talk, and I'm moderating the panel.
[3]Q. Will you be updating the audience in the
[4]important developments in the literature over the
[5]past year, for example?
[6]A. Yeah. Usually I try to look at the
[7]submitted abstracts to the American Society of
[8]Hematology and what's new and choose which are
[9]really more relevant factors, both in the clinical
[10]connection in what we have known and where we are
[11]going. I did that last year, and they have asked me
[12]to do it again.
[13]Q. Okay. So it's not a seminar in any
[14]particular topic?
[15]A. No.
[16]Q. At this point it's more of a -- an entree
[17]and an overview to the --
[18]A. Yeah. I'm focusing in my talk on
[19]large-cell lymphoma, but I'm also chairing and
[20]moderating the seminar with two other speakers that
[21]one of them will talk on follicular lymphoma and the
[22]other person on chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
[23]Q. Who are the other two speakers?
[24]A. I'll have to actually check whether I can
[25]give you the information, because the program is not
  Page 358
[1]out yet.
[2]Q. Okay.
[3]A. So if you don't mind, I'll check with them.
[4]I don't want to -- it may not be up.
[5]MR. LITZENBURG: Don't disclose anything
[6]that you don't know that you are able to --
[7]Q. When is the seminar?
[8]A. December. December 8. You're welcome to
[9]attend.
[10]Q. A 95 percent confidence interval, sir, only
[11]means that the real value is 95 percent likely to be
[12]within that range if the data is accurate and the
[13]data is not confounded and the data is not otherwise
[14]statistically biased; correct?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. The Greim paper that we talked about
[17]earlier, do you know, sir, that there is sworn
[18]testimony in this case that IARC is able to review
[19]unpublished articles that have been accepted for
[20]publication once they have been accepted for
[21]publication?
[22]A. Don't know that.
[23]Q. And the Greim had been accepted for
[24]publication for a full three months before IARC met?
[25]A. Did not have this information.
  Page 359
[1]Q. I want to mark your billing record, sir,
[2]that you were kind enough to submit to us.
[3](Nabhan Exhibit 24 marked for
[4]identification.)
[5]Q. Since there are two pages, I'm using two
[6]exhibit stickers, Exhibit 24 and 25.
[7](Nabhan Exhibit 25 marked for
[8]identification.)
[9]Q. And these are labeled as for the first and
[10]second quarter of 2017, sir?
[11]A. It looks like it, yes.
[12]Q. Had you been working on this project of
[13]assessing for plaintiffs' counsel the literature on
[14]the association or lack of association between
[15]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and glyphosate before the
[16]first quarter of 2017?
[17]A. I did do a little bit of work when I was
[18]first approached last summer where I did my own
[19]research to make a decision whether I would be an
[20]expert or not. I forgot. It was probably 7 to 10
[21]hours type thing. I think it was last year in May,
[22]looks like that. But that's it.
[23]Q. And you billed for that and were paid for
[24]that?
[25]A. I'm pretty sure I did.
  Page 360
[1]Q. You've been billing at the rate of $ 550 an
[2]hour, sir?
[3]A. It's a bargain. Yes.
[4]Q. And Innovative Oncology Consulting, which
[5]you asked Mr. Litzenburg to make the check payable
[6]to, what is that?
[7]A. That is my -- how do I call it? I formed
[8]an LLC, but I'm the sole owner of it.
[9]Q. That's an entity that you use to get paid
[10]through; is that right?
[11]A. Right. I had aspirations to be a
[12]consultant and didn't -- I stuck to my decision.
[13]Q. You're being one right now, aren't you?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]MR. GRIFFIS: That's all I have, thank you.
[16]MR. LITZENBURG: This is an "I'm probably
[17]done" break, but let's have a quick break.
