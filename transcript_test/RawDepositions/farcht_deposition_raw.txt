[12]Q Are you a certified surveyor?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q What kind of license does that take to be
[15]certified?
[16]A It takes a license for professional land
[17]surveying in various states.
[18]Q Do you have one in Maryland?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q Do you have one in Pennsylvania?
[21]A Yes.
[5]
[1]Q Okay. And you've been doing that for a
[2]long time, right?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q Okay. Have you done a survey of the
[5]McNulty property?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q Have you done a survey of the Casero
[8]property?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Okay. Does the McNulty property line call
[11]to the Mason-Dixon line?
[12]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[13]Q You can answer.
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. It goes to
[15]liability. What's -- what's the point of the question?
[16]MR. COLLINS: You can stop the deposition
[17]right now. And you can leave the room, please.
[18](Witness exited.)
[19]MR. COLLINS: Under the federal rules of
[20]civil procedure and the Maryland guidelines for taking
[21]depositions, a speaking objection is presumptively
[6]
[1]inappropriate. Please don't do that. I'm going to ask
[2]you not to do that anymore.
[3]The rules allow -- require him to answer
[4]questions as long I ask them. Unless there is a
[5]privilege involved. If there is a privilege, you can
[6]feel free to leave the room and discuss privilege with
[7]him, although, I cannot imagine that there would be a
[8]privilege here. Do you have anything else you want to
[9]say about this?
[10]MR. CHANG: Yeah. There is three court
[11]orders related to discovery, limiting discovery to
[12]issues of lability -- I'm sorry, limiting discovery to
[13]issues of damages and relief, right. So if you have a
[14]reason for asking that question, if you can explain to
[15]me why that goes to damages or relief, I'll allow the
[16]question and let him answer. If you can't, I'm going
[17]to instruct him not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: You do what you want. If you
[19]are going to instruct him not to answer, you are going
[20]to suffer the consequences of doing so.
[21]MR. CHANG: Okay.
[7]
[1]MR. COLLINS: All right. I'm not going to
[2]be bullied by you during this deposition with you
[3]telling me I can't answer -- ask questions that I
[4]choose to ask.
[5]I promise you I understand the court's
[6]ruling. I promise you I understand the court's ruling
[7]that this is limited to damages. I get that. I'm
[8]going to limit my questions to damages and within the
[9]scope of discovery as required under the Rule 26.
[10]Okay?
[11]MR. CHANG: It would be constructive and
[12]helpful, I think, for you and for all of us, if you
[13]could explain how that question relates to damages.
[14]MR. COLLINS: It clearly relates to
[15]damages. I don't need to explain it to you.
[16]MR. CHANG: Well, if it's clear, then
[17]explain it. It can't be that hard.
[18]MR. COLLINS: That's not what depositions
[19]are for.
[20]MR. CHANG: Okay. Well --
[21]MR. COLLINS: Depositions are for me to ask
[8]
[1]the witness questions.
[2]MR. CHANG: -- it's your deposition.
[3]Proceed how you want.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[5]MR. CHANG: I'm going to instruct him not
[6]to answer unless you explain how it goes to damages.
[7]MR. COLLINS: You can do what you want. If
[8]you are going to do that, then this deposition is going
[9]to be very short if you are going to take that
[10]position.
[11]MR. CHANG: So will the second one.
[12]MR. COLLINS: Huh?
[13]MR. CHANG: So will the second one.
[14](Witness entered the room.)
[15](The reporter read back as requested.)
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[17]I instruct you not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: It does not go to liability.
[19]Q You may answer the question. If he
[20]instructs you not to answer, I don't know what basis he
[21]has for doing so, but it's -- it's up to him.
[9]
[1]MR. CHANG: I am still instructing him not
[2]to answer. And just for the record, actually, there is
[3]three -- like I said, there is three discovery orders
[4]in place. The court --
[5]MR. COLLINS: By the way -- I'm sorry.
[6]Let's -- timewise.
[7]MR. CHANG: -- on the record.
[8]MR. COLLINS: I know. This is on the
[9]record, but it's not part of my deposition time. So
[10]please don't keep any time for this. Go ahead.
[11]MR. CHANG: The court has limited
[12]discovery, including depositions, to issues of damages
[13]and relief. I asked you if you could please explain
[14]how that question relates to damages and relief.
[15]You've refused to do so. And so I'm going to instruct
[16]my client not to answer until you explain how that
[17]relates to damages and relief satisfactorily.
[18]MR. COLLINS: Okay. And you have no right
[19]to ask me to explain anything during my deposition.
[20]MR. CHANG: Okay. Understood. I just want
[21]that on the record and that's it.
[10]
[1]MR. COLLINS: It's obvious that it has to
[2]do with damages. It's obvious.
[3]MR. CHANG: Please explain.
[4]MR. COLLINS: How much land is covered, is
[5]supposedly being trespassed upon, is obvious. Plus,
[6]there is an issue of malice. Knowledge and intent and
[7]scienter. So it's obvious. We've written about this
[8]multiple times. I'm not going to waste any of my
[9]deposition time, especially in front of the witness,
[10]about this. So let's continue asking questions.
[11]You've now instructed the witness not to answer the
[12]most obvious question in this case.
[13]Q So, Mr. Farcht, do you know where the
[14]Mason-Dixon line is?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. I instruct you not
[16]to answer.
[17]Q Mr. Farcht, do you know how much land --
[18]strike that.
[19]Do you know the difference between east and
[20]west?
[21]A Yes.
[11]
[1]Q Okay. Now, Mr. Farcht, in your report --
[2]MR. COLLINS: I'm going to have this marked
[3]as Exhibit Number 1. I'm going to have Plaintiff's
[4]Rule 26 disclosures marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit
[5]Number 1. Can you go ahead and do that? And we can
[6]use this for both depositions.
[7](Farcht Exhibit 1 was marked for purposes
[8]of identification.)
[9]MR. COLLINS: For the record, I've marked
[10]Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1, which is plaint -- excuse
[11]me, not Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1 -- Farcht Exhibit
[12]Number 1, which is Plaintiff's Rule 26 disclosures,
[13]which includes both your report and the report of the
[14]other expert in this case, Mr. Harvey.
[15]Q Is your report attached in the back there?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q Okay. Does it refer to the Mason-Dixon
[18]line? Just look at the last page. I'll save you some
[19]time.
[20]MR. CHANG: What page is that?
[21]MR. COLLINS: Last page.
[12]
[1]MR. CHANG: Page 3?
[2]MR. COLLINS: Last page.
[3]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry. This is the last
[4]page.
[5]MR. COLLINS: Maybe the next to last page.
[6]MR. CHANG: Of the exhibit?
[7]MR. COLLINS: Yeah. Exhibit 3. Take that
[8]last page off of there. That was a cover sheet from
[9]the photocopier.
[10]Q Does that refer to the Mason-Dixon line?
[11]A Please clarify the question.
[12]Q Does your Exhibit Number 3 in your report
[13]refer to the Mason-Dixon line?
[14]MR. CHANG: I want to clarify. I don't
[15]know if you want --
[16]MR. COLLINS: No, I don't want you to say
[17]anything unless you are going to say objection. Go
[18]ahead and say that.
[19]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[20]MR. COLLINS: Thank you. That's your job.
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous.
[13]
[1]Q Okay. Does it refer to the Mason-Dixon
[2]line?
[3]MR. CHANG: Answer if you understand the
[4]question.
[5]MR. COLLINS: Please don't say that to a
[6]witness.
[7]MR. CHANG: You can answer if you
[8]understand the question. If you don't understand the
[9]question, you can ask him to clarify.
[10]MR. COLLINS: Please don't ever say that
[11]again during my depositions. You have no right to say
[12]that.
[13]A The question is unclear.
[14]Q Thank you. Because counsel told you it was
[15]unclear.
[16]A No.
[17]Q Do you understand -- do you understand what
[18]the Maryland-Pennsylvania border is?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q Okay. Did you refer to the
[21]Maryland-Pennsylvania border in Exhibit 3 of your
[14]
[1]report?
[2]A No.
[3]Q Did you refer to monuments of the
[4]Maryland-Pennsylvania border?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q 37 and 38? Or at least to 37?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q Okay. Is that also known as the
[9]Mason-Dixon line?
[10]A Please clarify that.
[11]Q Do you know what the Mason-Dixon line is?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q Okay. Is the Mason-Dixon line referred to
[14]on either Exhibits 2 -- Exhibit 2 or 3 of your report?
[15]MR. COLLINS: Just for the record, the
[16]witness is taking a minute or two to answer these
[17]questions.
[18]Q It would seem like a pretty simple question
[19]to me. I don't understand why it's taking you so long.
[20]MR. CHANG: Just for the record, it's been
[21]about 15 seconds. I have a stopwatch right here.
[15]
[1]MR. COLLINS: Okay. Maybe -- maybe my time
[2]is wrong.
[3]A Please clarify the definition of the
[4]Mason-Dixon line that you were asking me if it refers
[5]to.
[6]Q I'm looking at your report, Exhibit Number
[7]2.
[8]A Uh-huh.
[9]Q And it says, "MA-PA Monument 38." Then it
[10]says, "MA-PA Monument 37." Then there is a straight
[11]line between those two, is there not?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q Okay. Is that also known as the
[14]Mason-Dixon line?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q And so it is referred to in your report,
[17]correct?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Okay. Thank you. Now -- so obviously you
[20]do know where the Mason-Dixon line is, correct?
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous.
[16]
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Okay. You wouldn't have put it in your
[3]report unless you knew where it was, right?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q Okay. Now, on Exhibit Number 2 of your
[6]report, can you please point out which line refers to
[7]the Mason-Dixon line?
[8]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous.
[9]Q I think I know which one it is, but if you
[10]could just refer to it on Exhibit Number 2 very
[11]specifically.
[12]A Please clarify the ambiguous term of
[13]Mason-Dixon line.
[14]Q All right. For purposes of today's
[15]deposition, when I refer to the Mason-Dixon line, I
[16]will be referring to what you are referring to in
[17]Exhibits 2 and 3 as the MA-PA Monument straight line
[18]between Monument between 37 and 38. Fair enough?
[19]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous. It's a
[20]little circular.
[21]Q Do you understand?
[17]
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Is that what you would refer to as the
[3]Mason-Dixon line?
[4]A The question is unclear.
[5]Q No. But I'm asking what would you call the
[6]Mason-Dixon line?
[7]A My research has discovered two, a historic
[8]line and a recently surveyed line.
[9]Q Okay. The one referred to on Exhibit 2, is
[10]that the historic line or the recently surveyed line?
[11]A If you are referring to the monument to
[12]monument line, that is the recently surveyed line.
[13]Q Recently surveyed line. Okay. So did
[14]somebody move Monuments 37 and 38?
[15]A No.
[16]Q So that's not a historical line?
[17]A No.
[18]Q All right. So do you -- in your practice,
[19]have you ever referred to the Mason-Dixon line before
[20]in your work as -- as a surveyor?
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection to form. Answer if
[18]
[1]you understand the question.
[2]A I do believe so.
[3]Q You've never had the opportunity or been
[4]called upon to find the Mason-Dixon line monuments and
[5]figure out where it is other than in this case?
[6]A No.
[7]Q Okay. That's fine. Do you have an
[8]understanding as an appraiser -- excuse me -- as a
[9]surveyor, how a competent appraiser would find the
[10]Mason-Dixon line?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Form.
[12]A Clarify the question, please.
[13]Q How would a competent appraiser find the
[14]border between Maryland and Pennsylvania?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. Form. He's not an
[16]appraiser. He doesn't know.
[17]Q I'm sorry. Appraiser. I apologize. I've
[18]been reading too much about appraisers later -- lately.
[19]How would a surveyor -- a competent surveyor find the
[20]border between Maryland and Pennsylvania?
[21]A He would plot deeds, research plans, and go
[19]
[1]in the field and look for evidence of boundary
[2]monumentation.
[3]Q All right. And what is -- what are the
[4]boundary monuments for the Maryland-Pennsylvania border
[5]known as?
[6]A There is a crown stone every five year --
[7]five miles, and there is a mile marker.
[8]Q Did you do that when you surveyed for your
[9]report?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q What did you find?
[12]A We discovered Monuments 37 and 38.
[13]Q And did you then create a plat that
[14]includes a straight line between 37 and 38?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Okay. And is that referred to in Exhibit
[17]2?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q And is that the -- the line on Exhibit
[20]Number 2 that is designated by a long line, two short
[21]lines, a long line, two short lines, etcetera?
[20]
[1]A Please clarify the location.
[2]Q Okay. Let me ask you. In Exhibit Number
[3]2, please point out which line you show on Exhibit
[4]Number 2 as the Maryland-Pennsylvania border?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection. Foundation.
[6]A Please clarify which state border.
[7]Q Are there two state borders, Maryland
[8]border and the Pennsylvania border?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q It's not the same line?
[11]A Clarify the question.
[12]Q You don't understand that question.
[13]MR. CHANG: Can you clarify the question?
[14]MR. COLLINS: I'll try. I'm just befuddled
[15]here. I'm having a hard time asking a simpler
[16]question.
[17]Q So what I'm asking is isn't the
[18]Maryland-Pennsylvania border the same exact line?
[19]MR. CHANG: Same exact line as what?
[20]Q For Maryland and for Pennsylvania?
[21]A Yes.
[21]
[1]Q And -- okay. On your Exhibit Number 2, the
[2]Maryland-Pennsylvania border is the line that is
[3]referred to -- or excuse me -- that is a dotted line
[4]with a long -- long -- excuse me -- a dashed line with
[5]a long dash and two short dashes, and which also
[6]coincides with where it says "Cotton gin spike found,"
[7]right?
[8]MR. CHANG: No. That's an object --
[9]objection. You are mischaracterizing his testimony.
[10]He never said that was --
[11]MR. COLLINS: Please stop, Mr. Chang.
[12]MR. CHANG: He never said that was the
[13]Maryland-Pennsylvania border.
[14]MR. COLLINS: Please stop with your
[15]speaking objections. I'm going to say this one more
[16]time and then I'm going to ask for sanctions against
[17]you if you do it again.
[18]MR. CHANG: Objection. Mischaracterization
[19]of his testimony.
[20]MR. COLLINS: That's not an appropriate
[21]objection. The appropriate objection is to the form of
[22]
[1]my question. It is not that I mischaracterized his
[2]testimony. I can do that if I want to.
[3]MR. CHANG: My objection is on the record.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Fine. Don't make it again,
[5]please.
[6]Q Now, what I'm asking you is -- I'm looking
[7]at your Exhibit Number 2. And is the
[8]Pennsylvania-Maryland border depicted on Exhibit Number
[9]2?
[10]A Twice.
[11]Q Okay. One time it is depicted as the
[12]straight line between Monuments 37 and 38, correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q Okay. That line is the -- the dashed line
[15]that has the cotton gin spikes in it, correct?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q Okay. And so when you went out into the
[18]field and you did your survey, you found Monument 37
[19]and 38, and you drew a straight line between the two,
[20]and you were -- showed that on Exhibit Number 2,
[21]correct?
[23]
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Okay. Okay. Now, Exhibit Number 2 also
[3]shows another line, correct?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q The southern boundary of the McNulty
[6]property, correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q Okay. And that line is south of what I'm
[9]going to call -- and I think you referred to in other
[10]exhibits as the actual Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[11]A I believe so.
[12]Q Okay. So on Exhibit Number 2, that line
[13]that we first -- we just identified first was
[14]previously called by you the actual Mason-Dixon line,
[15]right? And we'll just get our terms correct here,
[16]because I think you are referring to another line,
[17]which you've also identified as the surveyed
[18]Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[19]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. When did
[20]he say that that was the actual Mason-Dixon line? Do
[21]you have a document here, something to refer to?
[24]
[1]A I'm uncertain to the actual wording that
[2]you are --
[3]Q You don't recall preparing a survey that
[4]described something called the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[5]A No.
[6]Q You really don't? Okay. Do you recall
[7]calling a line a surveyed Mason-Dixon line?
[8]A Yes.
[9]Q Okay. Well, let me refresh your
[10]recollection. It's attached to the amended complaint
[11]in this case.
[12]MR. COLLINS: We'll have this marked as
[13]Exhibit Number 2.
[14](Farcht Exhibit 2 was marked for purposes
[15]of identification.)
[16]MR. CHANG: Do you have an extra copy?
[17]MR. COLLINS: I just gave it to you.
[18]MR. CHANG: Oh, thank you.
[19]Q Exhibit -- Exhibit Number 2 is hard to
[20]read, but do you recall creating this plat, which was
[21]attached as Exhibit A to the amended complaint?
[25]
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Does this refer to something called the
[3]actual Mason-Dixon line and the surveyed Mason-Dixon
[4]line?
[5]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. Again,
[6]this goes to liability.
[7]MR. COLLINS: I'm just trying to establish
[8]definitions for -- make this deposition go faster.
[9]MR. CHANG: You can establish your own
[10]definitions. I'm going to object. It goes to
[11]liability.
[12]MR. COLLINS: Go ahead.
[13]MR. CHANG: I don't see how this goes to
[14]damages. If you could explain, but I'm going to
[15]instruct you not to -- not to answer.
[16]MR. COLLINS: You are going to instruct him
[17]not to answer whether --
[18]MR. CHANG: I think --
[19]MR. COLLINS: Hang on. Hang on. Let me
[20]get clear. You are going to instruct him not to answer
[21]the question about whether Exhibit A to the complaint
[26]
[1]uses the term "actual Mason-Dixon line" and "surveyed
[2]Mason-Dixon line"?
[3]MR. CHANG: Okay. Go on. Yeah. That's
[4]fine. You can answer that question.
[5]A Is there a better copy?
[6]Q I can look for one. I'm sure there is. I
[7]mean, frankly, you prepared it. So I'm surprised
[8]that -- did you bring your file with you today, by the
[9]way?
[10]A No.
[11]Q So you disobeyed the subpoena?
[12]A I was advised not to.
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. Legal conclusion.
[14]There was a motion to quash.
[15]MR. COLLINS: When was the motion to quash
[16]filed?
[17]MR. CHANG: There was a motion to quash
[18]filed and granted on September 29th, 2017. It includes
[19]three of the five topics on this new subpoena were part
[20]of those old subpoenas that were quashed.
[21]MR. COLLINS: Hold up.
  27
[1]MR. CHANG: The two additional ones you
[2]asked for a draft of his expert report, which is
[3]protected under Rule 26. Then you asked for
[4]attorney-client privilege communications, which is
[5]obviously protected by attorney-client privilege. So
[6]no, we didn't bring any documents.
[7]MR. COLLINS: You didn't bring his file?
[8]MR. CHANG: That's correct.
[9]MR. COLLINS: That's audacious, but we'll
[10]move on.
[11]Q So just to be clear, you are not sure
[12]what -- I'm going to -- I'm going to represent to you
[13]right now that you have previously referred to
[14]something called the actual Mason-Dixon line and the
[15]surveyed Mason-Dixon line. And you don't
[16]currently -- you currently do not know what that means?
[17]MR. CHANG: Objection to form.
[18]A That's not correct.
[19]Q Do you know what those terms mean?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q Do you know -- do you know what you meant
  28
[1]when you used those terms?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q Okay. What did you mean when you called
[4]something the actual Mason-Dixon line, and what did you
[5]mean when you called it the survey Mason-Dixon line?
[6]A Those terms have been used -- a general
[7]term to define this was the recent monumented surveyed
[8]line of the Mason-Dixon and the historic line. Through
[9]all of this, that's what it boiled down to.
[10]Q What do you mean by that?
[11]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. Again, it
[12]goes to liability. I instruct you not to answer. I'm
[13]instructing you not to answer.
[14]Q What do you mean by the term "surveyed
[15]Mason-Dixon line"?
[16]MR. CHANG: Instruct you not to answer.
[17]Q Do you use something you call the surveyed
[18]Mason-Dixon line in preparing Exhibit Number 2 to your
[19]report?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q Do you refer to the actual Mason-Dixon line
  29
[1]in Exhibit Number 2 to your report?
[2]A No.
[3]Q You do not refer to that? All right. So
[4]let me show you Exhibit A to the complaint, a large
[5]version of it, okay, that is attached to the amended
[6]complaint that is Exhibit Number 2 in this deposition.
[7]This is my only copy of the large version, but you
[8]prepared this, did you not?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Okay. Now, this document is Exhibit A to
[11]the complaint, which is also referred to in your
[12]deposition as Exhibit Number 2, correct?
[13]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry, FJ. I didn't
[14]understand the question. Can you repeat it?
[15]Q This is Exhibit Number 2, correct, to your
[16]deposition, right?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q And Exhibit A inside of Exhibit Number 2 --
[19]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry.
[20]Q -- is the same thing as I'm showing you
[21]right here in front of you, correct?
  30
[1]A It appears to be.
[2]Q So, for the record, I have a large plat
[3]prepared by you, correct?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q And it refers to something called the
[6]actual Mason-Dixon line and the surveyed Mason-Dixon
[7]line, correct?
[8]A The question is incomplete.
[9]Q No. The question is does it refer to those
[10]two things?
[11]MR. CHANG: Answer if you -- if you can.
[12]If you understand the question.
[13]A There is a parenthetical --
[14]Q If you need help, I'll point it out to you.
[15]A There is a parenthetical inclusion.
[16]Q But hang on. All right. Let me rephrase
[17]the question because I'm going to be very explicit with
[18]it. On Exhibit A to the complaint, I see the words
[19]"actual Mason-Dixon line." Do you see that?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q Okay. Did you write that?
[31]
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Okay. Right above it it has another phrase
[3]or another term. It says "surveyed Mason-Dixon line."
[4]Do you see that?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q Okay. Did you write that?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q Okay. And it says "(by previous survey
[9]plans)," correct?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Okay. And so that's your work, correct?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q And this Exhibit A to the amended complaint
[14]is also referred to in your report, correct? Excuse
[15]me. Let me rephrase that.
[16]The same lines as reflected in Exhibit A
[17]are referred to in your report for your expert
[18]testimony, correct?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q Okay. Now, you don't call them exactly the
[21]same things. That's why I wanted to clarify all of
[32]
[1]this. Okay. In your Exhibit 2 to your report, you
[2]don't use the term "actual Mason-Dixon line" and
[3]"surveyed Mason-Dixon line," but you refer to the same
[4]lines; is that correct?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q So in exhibit -- in -- in -- in -- in the
[7]Exhibit 2 to your report, the actual Mason-Dixon line
[8]from Exhibit A to the amended complaint is referred to
[9]as MA-PA Monument 37 and MA-PA Monument 38, and the
[10]line that goes between those two, correct?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q Otherwise known as the actual Mason-Dixon
[13]line, correct?
[14]A Yes.
[15]Q All right. So the question I have for you,
[16]in light of that, how much land do you believe the
[17]McNultys own below the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[18]MR. CHANG: As the term is described and as
[19]you've discussed with FJ.
[20]A Approximately one-tenth of an acre.
[21]Q Okay. So is there -- have you seen any
  33
[1]documents filed that -- that support that contention?
[2]Filed in land records of Harford County. That would be
[3]in Harford County, right? If they own land south of
[4]the actual Mason-Dixon line, it should be recorded in
[5]Harford County, correct?
[6]MR. CHANG: Objection. Mischaracterization
[7]of testimony. Objection. Legal conclusion.
[8]MR. COLLINS: Please stop objecting except
[9]with the word objection. You know the rule. I've
[10]explained it to you again and again. I don't know
[11]whether things are different down in D.C., but in
[12]Maryland you don't do that.
[13]Q Mr. Farcht, have you seen any documents
[14]supporting your contention that one-tenth of an acre of
[15]land is owned by the McNultys in Maryland?
[16]MR. CHANG: Going to object. Goes to
[17]liability. I instruct you not to answer the question.
[18]MR. COLLINS: You are instructing him not
[19]to answer that? It goes to damages. It's whether or
[20]not there is a tenth of an acre that is being
[21]trespassed upon. You are the ones alleging that
[34]
[1]they've trespassed upon one-tenth of an acre. I need
[2]to explore that with him.
[3]MR. CHANG: Do you want to talk about this?
[4]MR. COLLINS: I -- I -- no, I want to ask
[5]the witness the questions. If you are going to
[6]instruct him not to answer that, you do that at your
[7]own risk because I am going to move to exclude his
[8]testimony if you do that.
[9]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[10]MR. COLLINS: Okay. All right.
[11]Q So how did you calculate the amount of land
[12]on which the Caseros are trespassing?
[13]A I researched the deeds and plans, including
[14]the original conveyance of the Casero property based on
[15]the survey in 1934, which clearly called for the south
[16]side of the road.
[17]Q Anything else?
[18]A It also agrees with the former Highland
[19]survey to the south side of the road. And it agrees
[20]with monumentation east and west of this property that
[21]was recovered in the field.
  35
[1]Q I'm asking you how did you calculate that
[2]there was one-tenth of an acre trespassed upon by the
[3]Caseros?
[4]A It was the difference of that line
[5]monumented and the claim line to be on the actual line
[6]of the north.
[7]Q To clarify what you just said. I think
[8]what you just said is that the Caseros [sic] own
[9]one-tenth of an acre south of the actual Mason-Dixon
[10]line. Is that true or not?
[11]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. Again,
[12]goes to liability, which has already been decided.
[13]Instruct you not to answer.
[14]MR. COLLINS: Doesn't go to liability.
[15]Goes to damages.
[16]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[17]MR. COLLINS: You are going to tell him not
[18]to tell me whether or not the McNultys own one-tenth of
[19]acre south of the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[20]MR. CHANG: To be clear, actual Mason-Dixon
[21]line as it's defined --
  36
[1]MR. COLLINS: On his document.
[2]MR. CHANG: -- in -- in this Exhibit A?
[3]MR. COLLINS: Yes.
[4]MR. CHANG: Okay. Do you understand the
[5]question?
[6]THE WITNESS: Yes.
[7]A Although, I thought you said Casero the
[8]first time.
[9]Q I may have, and I apologize if I got the
[10]names mixed up. I've done -- I've done that before in
[11]other depositions too. So if you ever -- if you ever
[12]think I'm making a mistake on names, please correct me.
[13]A Please repeat the question.
[14]Q Sure. All right. Let me start over again.
[15]Is it your opinion, based upon your work,
[16]that the McNultys own one-tenth of an acre south of
[17]what you described as the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Okay. Now the foundation for that opinion,
[20]does it include any documents from Harford County land
[21]records?
  37
[1]A Clarify "land records," please.
[2]Q You know what the land records office is,
[3]don't you?
[4]A There is also the archives in Maryland.
[5]That is considered land records.
[6](The reporter asked for clarification.)
[7]A Maryland Archives.
[8]Q I thought when you did a title search you
[9]looked at something called the county land records
[10]office. Maybe there is something more I didn't know
[11]about. Do you look beyond that?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q And where else do you look?
[14]A We went to historical societies in Harford
[15]County. We went to the Maryland Archives.
[16]Q Okay. What did you find?
[17]A We found the record of the original
[18]creation of the Casero nine plus acre tract.
[19]Q Where was that?
[20]A In the Maryland archives.
[21]Q It was not in Maryland -- in Harford County
  38
[1]land records?
[2]A It could be if you traced back, but this
[3]went straight to the creation at the Archives.
[4]Q Do you know what the document is called?
[5]A Well, there is a deed that was in the court
[6]proceedings for the settlement of the state -- of the
[7]estate of Emma S. Cole.
[8]Q Okay. And you didn't bring it with you
[9]though?
[10]A No. But it -- I don't know if it's here or
[11]not.
[12]Q You didn't bring it?
[13]A No. I was advised not to.
[14]Q By Mr. Chang, correct?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. Attorney-client
[16]privilege.
[17]MR. COLLINS: He is not a client.
[18]MR. CHANG: He's an agent. A client --
[19]privilege extends to an agent.
[20]MR. COLLINS: No. You don't have an
[21]attorney-client privilege with him.
  39
[1]MR. CHANG: Objection. Attorney-client
[2]privilege.
[3]MR. COLLINS: You are wrong.
[4]MR. CHANG: Instruct you not to answer.
[5]MR. COLLINS: All right. Do that again at
[6]your risk.
[7]Q All right. All right. So let's go back to
[8]your report. It's Exhibit -- you did an affidavit. Do
[9]you remember that?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Paragraph 7. In forming your opinions
[12]you've looked at the McNulty deed chain back, correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q You looked at the Casero chain back, right?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Do you notice that the Casero chain back
[17]included reference to the Mason-Dixon line?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q And so did the McNulty chain back, right?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q So how much land is being trespassed upon
  40
[1]all depends upon where the Mason-Dixon line is,
[2]correct?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q That's really the heart of this whole
[5]dispute, right?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q And so determining how much -- the way --
[8]in the way of damages all depends upon where the
[9]Mason-Dixon line is, right?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Legal conclusion.
[11]Q You agree?
[12]A I assume.
[13]Q Okay. And so in rendering your opinion,
[14]your opinion is based upon not the actual Mason-Dixon
[15]line, but the surveyed Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous. Answer
[17]if you understand.
[18]A This surveyed as noted parenthetically by
[19]previous survey and historic documents.
[20]Q Okay. All right. So the answer is yes?
[21]A That being said, yes.
[41]
[1]Q Okay. All right. You refer in Paragraph
[2]7D to an order of the Circuit Court for Harford County
[3]dated April 13th, 1934. That has never been provided
[4]to us. Can you tell me what's in that order?
[5]A That was to settle the estate of Emma S.
[6]Cole because of the death of her husband.
[7]Q And how did that impact your opinions?
[8]A That was the initiation of the creation of
[9]this nine plus acre parcel from 41 acres. The original
[10]parent tract exclusion.
[11]Q For the Caseros' property?
[12]A The former owners of Casero.
[13]Q So it has to do with the size and shape of
[14]the land south of the Mason-Dixon line? In other
[15]words, land in Maryland, right?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q Okay. And then -- and how does it inform
[18]your -- your -- your report? You refer to it. You
[19]thought it was important. What does it -- why is it
[20]important?
[21]A The surveyor is to retrace the steps of the
[42]
[1]original surveyor where the first creation of a parcel
[2]came about. We were able to clearly see the
[3]origination of this parcel from within a 41-acre tract.
[4]Originally it was to be four acres by these documents.
[5]And on a viewing, they decided it wasn't enough woods
[6]for the widow to have firewood, so they added it to
[7]make it 9.43, I believe.
[8]So from that -- that was the original
[9]survey, like the first subdivision of this lot. And
[10]based on those records, it clearly stated that's along
[11]the south side of the road and continuing along and
[12]ending along.
[13]Q Okay. So that's -- I think I just
[14]understood you. It's a circuit court order that
[15]describes a lot that is being conveyed to a widow,
[16]right?
[17]A Both of those.
[18]Q Okay. And it's all in Maryland, correct?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q No land in Pennsylvania is involved,
[21]correct?
  43
[1]A To the best of my knowledge.
[2]Q Did it reference the Mason-Dixon line?
[3]A I don't believe so.
[4]Q And it only describes land that is covered
[5]by the Casero deed, not land covered by the McNulty
[6]deed, correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q Okay. And the reference to -- in this
[9]document is to Salt Lake Road or to Line Road, or what?
[10]A I believe it was Line Road at that time.
[11]Q Okay. And so it refers to the south side
[12]of Line Road?
[13]A It was either that or a public road. South
[14]side of --
[15]Q Okay. Okay. Do you have any evidence to
[16]indicate -- let me restate that question.
[17]Is your opinion based upon a belief that
[18]Salt Lake Road or Line Road, also known as Line Road,
[19]has moved in any way?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous. Answer
[21]if you understand.
  44
[1]A Please restate that.
[2]Q The parameters of that road, have they
[3]changed over time?
[4]A Not to the best of my knowledge.
[5]Q So when it refers to the south side of Salt
[6]Lake Road, you think the south side or -- or to the
[7]road, it's the same place as it is currently?
[8]A I believe so.
[9]Q Okay. All right. Is there any indication
[10]in that court order that there was an intent to leave
[11]land unconveyed up to -- from that south side of the
[12]Salt Lake Road to the Mason-Dixon line? To the actual
[13]Mason-Dixon line?
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. Answer if you
[15]understand.
[16]A In my research, it started at a stone,
[17]which since it did not say a planted stone, it was
[18]generally understood by most surveyors to be an
[19]existing stone. And from that they went along the
[20]road.
[21]Q Along the road?
[45]
[1]A To the south side of the road.
[2]Q On the south side of the road?
[3]A Based on the survey derived -- description
[4]of the first creation of this parcel for the widow.
[5]Q Okay. Did it refer to the lands to the
[6]north in any way?
[7]A I don't believe so.
[8]Q All right. So the -- under Paragraph E, 7E
[9]of your report, what is that document?
[10]A E generally expounded upon D, which D lists
[11]the settlement expenses, including $ 18 for the survey.
[12]Then E went on to provide a description within E of the
[13]actual final 9, I believe, .43 acres. That was the
[14]final boundary after the addition of the five acres to
[15]the four acre original.
[16]Q Provided a metes and bounds description?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q Okay. And did it -- did it have any impact
[19]on land north of the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[20]A I'm not sure.
[21]Q Well, did it refer to land in Pennsylvania
  46
[1]at any point?
[2]A No.
[3]Q It was a Harford County decision related
[4]only to land in Harford County, correct?
[5]A I believe so.
[6]Q Okay. So how do those documents in any way
[7]inform you regarding the perimeter of the McNulty land?
[8]A This same line when surveyed in the field
[9]was monumented, and the monumentation continued up
[10]through the Archer farm. And it has been perpetuated
[11]as a boundary between the parcels to the north and the
[12]parcels to the south.
[13]Q Oh, all right. So now I think maybe I'm
[14]finally understanding you. Somehow you think that
[15]these documents, these court orders, are also defining
[16]the lands to the north?
[17]A Not those in and of themselves.
[18]Q Is there any document in the McNulty chain
[19]back that refers to these court orders?
[20]A No.
[21]Q Is there any document in the McNulty chain
  47
[1]back that says that they own land south of the actual
[2]Mason-Dixon line, and how much they own?
[3]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object to the
[4]first part of that question.
[5]MR. COLLINS: Well, I'll rephrase it.
[6]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[7]MR. COLLINS: No, I won't rephrase it. You
[8]are going to instruct him not to answer it.
[9]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object to the
[10]first part of that question. It's a compound question.
[11]And then I'm going to instruct him not to answer the
[12]first part of that compound question.
[13]Q Go ahead and answer the second part.
[14]A Please repeat the second part.
[15]Q I'm going to ask you, is there any document
[16]that you've looked at in the chain back of the McNulty
[17]deed that tells how much land the McNultys own south of
[18]the Mason -- actual Mason-Dixon line?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q What?
[21]A There were prior subdivision plans and
  48
[1]surveys that in agreement with field monumentation met
[2]that line.
[3]Q Met what line?
[4]A The line that was originally documented in
[5]the court orders and to the west by other surveys.
[6]Q Can you explain that in more detail?
[7]I'm -- I'm lost.
[8]A Okay. My primary position is that of an
[9]evidence gatherer. To go out and find what I can,
[10]compare it to the record documents, and reestablish a
[11]boundary. This boundary was first reestablished by
[12]these court orders. That's the first time that created
[13]that boundary. It did not exist before that for 9.43
[14]acres, approximately.
[15]The monumentation in the field agrees with
[16]that line. And the surveys and subdivisions on the
[17]north met that line.
[18]Q When was the first time there was any sort
[19]of subdivision to the north that included land south of
[20]the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous. Answer
  49
[1]if you understand.
[2]A I believe the first subdivision plan was
[3]1990.
[4]Q Okay. So the first time there was ever any
[5]indication that the people to the north of Salt Lake
[6]Road owned land south of the actual Mason-Dixon line
[7]was in 1990?
[8]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object again.
[9]Again, this goes to liability. Instruct you not to
[10]answer.
[11]Q The first time there is any indication of
[12]how much land the people to the north owned south of
[13]the actual Mason-Dixon line was when?
[14]A Deeds before the subdivision was prepared
[15]appeared to meet that line based on monumentation even
[16]beyond the road to the back of the parcels. We found
[17]pins in the back that if you take the distances and
[18]build these blocks forward, they fit to this line.
[19]Everything up before nine -- every -- the majority of
[20]the monumentation, if not all that we found, put things
[21]together on that line.
  50
[1]Q Starting when?
[2]A I don't have the deed chain back with me.
[3]The first recorded subdivision, I believe, was 1990,
[4]but that referred to deeds before that.
[5]Q Have you seen any document before 1990 that
[6]indicates that the owners of land north of the
[7]Mason-Dixon line owned land south of what you call the
[8]actual Mason-Dixon line?
[9]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object.
[10]Q And if so, what -- what deeds were they,
[11]and how much land was involved?
[12]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[13]I instruct you not to answer.
[14]MR. COLLINS: I asked how much land was
[15]involved.
[16]MR. CHANG: And I objected. Goes to
[17]liability. Instruct you not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: So you are not -- you are not
[19]going to let him give opinions regarding how much land
[20]south of the actual Mason-Dixon line is involved in
[21]this case?
[51]
[1]MR. CHANG: Can you repeat that? I
[2]didn't --
[3]Q How --
[4]MR. COLLINS: Let me ask the witness.
[5]Q How much land south of the actual Dixon
[6]line do you think the Caseros are trespassing upon?
[7]One-tenth of an acre?
[8]A Yes.
[9]Q And please tell me what documents
[10]specifically inform that opinion?
[11]A The court orders establishing this parcel
[12]originally, and the deeds when plotted in comparison
[13]with field evidence, and reestablished to that previous
[14]surveyed line.
[15]Q What deeds?
[16]A The prior deeds of Archer on the south
[17]matching to the deed plots to the north of the adjoiner
[18]of McNulty.
[19]Q What deeds? Can you tell me what the deeds
[20]page and liber are?
[21]A Not offhand.
[52]
[1]Q So you cannot, sitting here today, tell me
[2]what deeds you are referring to to suggest that the
[3]McNultys own one-tenth of an acre south of the
[4]Mason-Dixon line?
[5]A I would have to review my detail chain of
[6]title.
[7]Q Well, no. All you would have to do is
[8]review the seven things -- or the five things referred
[9]to in Paragraph 7, right?
[10]A That is there. The Casero chain back and
[11]the McNulty deed chain back.
[12]Q So you are referring to things that aren't
[13]even attached to your report?
[14]A That's correct. They are named in my
[15]report.
[16]Q So you cannot tell me a specific deed that
[17]you are relying upon to suggest that the McNultys own
[18]one-tenth of an acre south of the actual Mason-Dixon
[19]line?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[21]A I can tell you to the best of my knowledge,
  53
[1]based on the field evidence, the deed plots, in
[2]comparison to the record documents, this is where I
[3]believe the historic or previous survey line where they
[4]met, to be.
[5]Q All right. Let me rephrase what I think
[6]you are saying. What I think you are saying is that
[7]although the McNultys' deed refers to the Mason-Dixon
[8]line or the Maryland-Pennsylvania border, you believe
[9]that they actually own one-tenth of an acre south of
[10]the Maryland-Pennsylvania border, correct?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Mischaracterization
[12]of testimony.
[13]Q Is that true or not?
[14]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object because it
[15]goes to liability.
[16]MR. COLLINS: It does not.
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm going to instruct the
[18]witness not to answer the question.
[19]Q In your efforts to determine how much land
[20]south of the actual Mason-Dixon line the McNultys own,
[21]did you go back to the 1908 resurvey of the Mason-Dixon
  54
[1]line?
[2]A I read of that, yes.
[3]Q When did you do that?
[4]A Sometime ago.
[5]Q That's not very specific. Can you be more
[6]specific?
[7]A I researched the monuments that were
[8]recovered. I researched several old treatises, so to
[9]speak, on the survey of the Mason-Dixon line. And I
[10]researched -- there is a society -- the Maryland --
[11]Preservation of the Maryland Mason-Dixon Line Society,
[12]which Todd Babcock was president of or a leader of, and
[13]I researched information from him.
[14]Q Who was?
[15]A Todd Babcock.
[16]Q Oh, okay.
[17]A So it was before the reestablishment of
[18]this boundary as shown. I'm not sure of the exact
[19]date.
[20]Q Okay. Did you do it before you prepared
[21]Exhibit A to the amended complaint?
  55
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Okay. Did you look at the book called the
[3]Resurvey of the Maryland Mason -- of the Mason-Dixon
[4]Line from 1908?
[5]A I believe it was 1908. I have copies of
[6]the field survey notes.
[7]Q Okay. And what did that say about how much
[8]land -- well, let me ask it. What did that say about
[9]where the actual Mason-Dixon line is in relation to
[10]Salt Lake Road?
[11]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object again.
[12]This goes to liability. This has nothing -- it goes to
[13]liability. I instruct you not to --
[14]MR. COLLINS: It does not go to liability.
[15]It goes to damages. It goes to how much land the
[16]McNultys own south of the Mason-Dixon line.
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm happy to discuss it with
[18]you if you want off the record.
[19]MR. COLLINS: No. We can do it on the
[20]record. I need your full explanation because I'm
[21]moving for sanctions.
[56]
[1]MR. CHANG: You are asking questions.
[2]MR. COLLINS: Hold on. Let's let the
[3]witness leave the room.
[4](Witness exited.)
[5]MR. CHANG: You are asking questions
[6]related to liability, and they go to liability -- the
[7]court has already entered summary judgment on liability
[8]in favor of the McNultys, right. So we have a 14 count
[9]amended complaint. Some of those counts -- I mean, off
[10]the top of my head, ejectment, trespass, declaratory
[11]judgment with respect to where the southern boundary
[12]is. You are asking questions that go to liability.
[13]That go to where that southern boundary is.
[14]Further, I mean I think what you are doing
[15]is also trying to confuse the witness with respect to
[16]conflating the actual Mason-Dixon line with the
[17]Maryland-Pennsylvania border, which I think
[18]mischaracterizes his testimony grossly.
[19]MR. COLLINS: Okay. Anything else?
[20]MR. CHANG: No.
[21]MR. COLLINS: Bring him back in.
  57
[1]MR. CHANG: If you can explain to me how
[2]that's wrong and how your questions do go to damages,
[3]I'm certainly happy to consider it and then reconsider
[4]any objections I might have moving forward with respect
[5]to those questions.
[6]MR. COLLINS: You are not -- you are
[7]keeping the time on this? Okay. Sure. Very briefly,
[8]we've already spoken about or written about this
[9]extensively. But clearly, his report addresses how
[10]much land is owned below the Mason-Dixon line. I'm
[11]entitled to ask about that.
[12]MR. CHANG: See, there you go again. you
[13]said "below the Mason-Dixon line."
[14]MR. COLLINS: Correct.
[15]MR. CHANG: There is a may -- there is --
[16]this has been litigated since last year, FJ. There is
[17]what you call the -- you know, what I guess is the
[18]actual Mason-Dixon line, then the surveyed Mason-Dixon
[19]line. The court agreed with what the long-established
[20]historically recognized Mason-Dixon line was.
[21]MR. COLLINS: I need to know which one that
  58
[1]is. I need to know which one that is.
[2]MR. CHANG: You already know which one that
[3]is.
[4]MR. COLLINS: No, I don't. I don't. The
[5]court order doesn't say that. The court opinion
[6]doesn't say that. The court opinion only says that the
[7]deacon's line case applies in this case. So hold on.
[8]Let me speak. You are about to speak.
[9]MR. CHANG: Go ahead.
[10]MR. COLLINS: That's all the opinion says.
[11]Now you're going for damages. You have to prove how
[12]much land is being trespassed upon and that there was
[13]actual malice. Those things are relevant.
[14]You are stopping me from finding out how
[15]much land was trespassed upon -- trespasses upon. How
[16]much land is involved. And you are preventing me from
[17]getting any evidence regarding whether or not the
[18]Caseros were engaged in actual malice, or whether they
[19]had a reasonable belief in what they did. You are
[20]preventing me from doing that.
[21]So I'm going to move to have everything
  59
[1]stricken. I'm going to move to have your witness's
[2]report and his testimony stricken unless you let me ask
[3]my questions. You can keep telling him not to answer.
[4]As far as I'm concerned, that's wonderful
[5]because all you are doing is shooting yourself in the
[6]foot. But you keep doing that. That's your choice.
[7]Okay. My intent is to get the truth. If you are not
[8]going to let him give us the truth, then keep at it.
[9]MR. CHANG: All right. So -- so you said
[10]that the court opinion was vague.
[11]MR. COLLINS: No, I didn't say vague.
[12]MR. CHANG: Well, you said it didn't
[13]specify -- you said it lacks specificity, which you are
[14]now trying to explore. To -- I mean, the bottom line
[15]is the court entered summary judgment and liability in
[16]our favor. You have filed a motion for reconsideration
[17]outlining everything, outlining all your documents
[18]pointing to 1908 survey, whatever, whatever relevance
[19]that has. You threw everything at it. The court
[20]denied your motion for reconsideration. Then about a
[21]month later you filed two motions to strike those court
  60
[1]orders. The court also denied those. Those were fully
[2]briefed.
[3]MR. COLLINS: I understand.
[4]MR. CHANG: Those were fully briefed.
[5]MR. COLLINS: And I'm going on damages.
[6]MR. CHANG: And the court still, again,
[7]entered judgment in our favor on liability. Denied
[8]your motion to reconsider. Then denied your two
[9]motions to strike. So I think liability is decided
[10]here. I think it's decided here.
[11]MR. COLLINS: You can think whatever you
[12]want.
[13]MR. CHANG: If you want to ask questions
[14]with respect to damages or relief, that's perfectly
[15]fine. But if you are going to go to liability and, you
[16]know, ask questions on whether or not the McNultys own
[17]property in Maryland, they don't. You know that. The
[18]court has already decided that.
[19]MR. COLLINS: Great. Great. You've just
[20]stipulated for the record that the McNultys do not own
[21]land in Maryland, correct? Did you?
[61]
[1]MR. CHANG: I'm not testifying here.
[2]MR. COLLINS: Did you just stipulate --
[3]MR. CHANG: That's been your argument --
[4]that's been your argument the whole time.
[5]MR. COLLINS: Wait a minute. Did you just
[6]stipulate to that effect or not?
[7]MR. CHANG: No, I'm not stipulating to
[8]anything.
[9]MR. COLLINS: All right. So that's what I
[10]heard, but anyway, we'll get the witness back. You
[11]keep instructing him not to answer. Just be prepared
[12]for a motion based upon that. Bad faith as far as I'm
[13]concerned.
[14](Witness entered.)
[15](The reporter read back as requested.)
[16]Q Actually, let me -- let me start over
[17]again. In your efforts to figure out how much land is
[18]involved in this dispute, did you look at 1908 resurvey
[19]of the Mason-Dixon line?
[20]A I believe it was the 1908 survey that I
[21]have the field notes copies of.
  62
[1]Q Okay. And from that were you able to
[2]determine that what you referred to as the actual
[3]Mason-Dixon line in your survey lies in and through
[4]Salt Lake Road?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[6]Instruct the client not to answer.
[7]Q From that were you able to determine how
[8]much land the McNultys own south of the line that you
[9]call the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[10]A That was all part of the review.
[11]Q Okay. So the answer is yes or no?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q And how much -- and did that help you in
[14]determining how much land the McNultys own south of
[15]what you call the actual Mason-Dixon line, that 1908
[16]resurvey?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q Okay. What did it tell you?
[19]A The resurvey, for all intents and purposes,
[20]corresponds to the monument-to-monument survey of the
[21]current time.
  63
[1]Q Okay. So the 1908 resurvey of the
[2]Mason-Dixon line corresponds, for all intents and
[3]purposes, with what you call on Exhibit A to the
[4]amended complaint as the actual Mason-Dixon line,
[5]correct?
[6]MR. CHANG: Again, I'm going to object.
[7]This goes to liability. Instruct you not to answer.
[8]MR. COLLINS: It's words that he used on
[9]his report.
[10]MR. CHANG: Again, I object.
[11]MR. COLLINS: You can't do that.
[12]MR. CHANG: I'm -- I'm going to instruct
[13]you not to answer. It goes to liability.
[14]Q Did the 1908 resurvey in any way assist you
[15]in determining where the actual Mason-Dixon line is
[16]on -- as reflected in your report?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q What did it tell you?
[19]A That was the -- that was the confirmation
[20]of the straight line between the two monuments.
[21]Q Okay. So for purposes of our discussion
  64
[1]today, as reflected on Exhibit A to the amended
[2]complaint, the 1908 resurvey corresponds to what you
[3]call the actual Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[4]A In general terms.
[5]Q Okay. All right. Now, did you see where
[6]the Caseros put a driveway?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q How much land of the Caseros -- excuse me.
[9]Strike that.
[10]How much blacktop or asphalt is on what you
[11]believe to be the McNultys' land? How many square feet
[12]are affected?
[13]A I do not know.
[14]Q You never calculated that?
[15]A No.
[16]Q What other trespass -- you referred in your
[17]report to a trespass. Remember that, Paragraph 11?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q What trespass are you referring to?
[20]A To the best of my knowledge, that was the
[21]area that contained the fence that was removed.
  65
[1]Q Can you explain that? I didn't follow you.
[2]A Well, I understood by discussion that the
[3]fence was within that strip. And it had been removed.
[4]Q Oh, within the one-tenth of an acre strip?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q There was a fence that was removed. Do you
[7]know where it was?
[8]A We think we have an idea based on the
[9]topography. I did not see the fence.
[10]Q So you didn't mark it on your Exhibit A, or
[11]in your report?
[12]A I don't think it's marked on there.
[13]Q Do you know how much of the fence, if any,
[14]was owned by the McNultys prior to 2013?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. He's a surveyor.
[16]Also, it's already been decided. Goes to liability.
[17]Instruct you not to answer.
[18]Q Do you know how much --
[19]MR. COLLINS: That's just totally wrong.
[20]Okay. I mean, you are just messing with this
[21]deposition for the purposes of messing it and avoiding
  66
[1]the truth. I'm just trying to get to the truth here.
[2]Q Does this witness have any opinion about
[3]where the fence lay?
[4]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[5]Instruct you not to answer.
[6]MR. COLLINS: So he's not going to testify
[7]about where the fence was?
[8]MR. CHANG: You are asking me a question
[9]now, right?
[10]MR. COLLINS: I want to get clear here --
[11]MR. CHANG: We had -- we had allegations in
[12]our amended complaint about where this fence was.
[13]MR. COLLINS: And do you think allegations
[14]are evidence?
[15]MR. CHANG: No, but the court entered
[16]summary judgment in favor of the McNultys.
[17]MR. COLLINS: No. No. No. The court did
[18]not say anything about where the fence was.
[19]MR. CHANG: There were counts related to
[20]the fence.
[21]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't matter. I'm
[67]
[1]asking this witness.
[2]Q Are you going to -- have you prepared any
[3]opinions related to where the fence was?
[4]A Not officially.
[5]Q Okay. Do you plan on testifying about
[6]where the fence was?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. Instruct you not to
[8]answer.
[9]Q Are you going to form any opinions after
[10]today's deposition about where the fence was?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Instruct you not to
[12]answer.
[13]Q All right.
[14]MR. COLLINS: All right. So I'm going to
[15]be very clear on the record. This witness -- I'm going
[16]to object to this witness providing any testimony about
[17]the fence because he doesn't know where it was unless
[18]he gives me the answer right now.
[19]Q Where was the fence?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. I instruct you not
[21]to answer.
  68
[1]Q Okay. Do you have an opinion that the
[2]fence was on the McNulty property?
[3]MR. CHANG: Objection. I instruct you not
[4]to answer.
[5]Q Do you know how much of the fence was on
[6]the McNulty property?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. I instruct you not
[8]to answer.
[9]Q All right. So let's go to Paragraph Number
[10]9 of your report. That refers to Exhibit 3 of your
[11]report, right?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q All right. Now, it says "Also attached to
[14]this declaration is an accurate and complete copy of a
[15]surveying exhibit that identifies the approximate
[16]distance between the Casero property -- west property
[17]corner and waterbed of a stream that intersects the
[18]McNulty property," correct?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q Is that accurate?
[21]MR. CHANG: Real quick. I'm sorry. I'm
  69
[1]going to stipulate that there is a typo in the report.
[2]MR. COLLINS: So you are going to prohibit
[3]him from answering that question. You are going to
[4]tell him what to say?
[5]MR. CHANG: I'm stipulating that there is
[6]a -- a typo in the report.
[7]MR. COLLINS: You just told him what to
[8]say.
[9]MR. CHANG: I'm stipulating that there is a
[10]typo in the report where it says, Number 9 "Also
[11]attached to this declaration is an accurate and
[12]complete copy of a surveying exhibit that identifies
[13]the approximate distance between the Casero property
[14]west property corner and waterbed of a stream that
[15]intersects the McNulty property. See Exhibit 3."
[16]Where it says "west property corner" it should have
[17]said "east property corner." That is a typo.
[18]MR. COLLINS: You just told the witness
[19]what to say.
[20]MR. CHANG: I didn't. I stipulated that
[21]there was a typo in the report.
  70
[1]Q Do you agree with Mr. Chang?
[2]A I saw that earlier, yes.
[3]Q Okay. So your report is inaccurate,
[4]correct?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[6]Mischaracterization.
[7]A The term "west" is not accurate. It should
[8]have been "east."
[9]Q All right. Now, let me back up to one
[10]other thing, by the way. I was accused of conflating
[11]the Maryland-Pennsylvania border with the Mason-Dixon
[12]line. Do you think that they are two different things,
[13]or are they the same thing?
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous.
[15]Q You can answer.
[16]A Please clarify "conflating."
[17]Q Well, I was talking about -- my question
[18]was is the Maryland-Pennsylvania border the same exact
[19]thing as what is often referred to as the Mason-Dixon
[20]line?
[21]A I believe so.
[71]
[1]Q Okay. And is it -- is it also the same
[2]thing as referred to in Exhibit A to the amended
[3]complaint as the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[4]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous.
[5]Q You can answer.
[6]MR. CHANG: Actually, no. This goes to
[7]liability. I'm going to instruct the witness not to
[8]answer.
[9]MR. COLLINS: It's in his report. How can
[10]you tell him not to answer something that's in his
[11]report. And you accused me of conflating it. I want
[12]to clarify. Am I conflating? Am I -- am I wrong when
[13]I think that the Mason-Dixon line is the same thing as
[14]the actual Mason-Dixon line? Or -- or -- or that the
[15]Maryland-Pennsylvania border is the same thing as what
[16]he calls the actual Mason-Dixon line?
[17]MR. CHANG: Since you are addressing this
[18]to them, I'm going to respond. Earlier you were
[19]conflating the Maryland-Pennsylvania border with the
[20]actual Mason-Dixon line as it was defined previously.
[21]Now the question to him, you asked him is the
  72
[1]Mason-Dixon line, not the actual Mason-Dixon line, but
[2]is a Mason-Dixon line the same thing as the
[3]Maryland-Pennsylvania border. This is --
[4]MR. COLLINS: I'll clarify.
[5]MR. CHANG: If you are -- if you are --
[6]MR. COLLINS: We can make that the same
[7]thing.
[8]MR. CHANG: -- if you are -- if you are
[9]making an honest error, or if you are intentionally
[10]trying to confuse the witness. But I'm just trying to
[11]point that out because it's ambiguous --
[12]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[13]MR. CHANG: -- the way you are phrasing the
[14]questions.
[15]MR. COLLINS: Let's make it clearer.
[16]Q Is the Maryland-Pennsylvania border the
[17]same thing that you refer to as the actual Mason-Dixon
[18]line in Exhibit A to the amended complaint?
[19]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[20]I instruct you not to answer.
[21]MR. COLLINS: I thought I was just
  73
[1]clarifying the question that you -- you suggested I do.
[2]MR. CHANG: I'm objecting to your question
[3]because it goes to liability, and I'm instructing the
[4]witness not to answer.
[5]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't just go to
[6]liability. It also goes to damages.
[7]MR. CHANG: Explain why.
[8]MR. COLLINS: Huh? Because it has to do
[9]with how much land. And it has to do with defining
[10]terms that he has used. The terms that he has used in
[11]his own report I get to define when I'm questioning
[12]him.
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. If you -- is the
[14]question still on the table?
[15]MR. COLLINS: Yes.
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[17]I instruct you not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: So you are not letting him
[19]answer the question about what -- all right. Let me
[20]ask it this way.
[21]Q The term "actual Mason-Dixon line" on
  74
[1]Exhibit A, is that the same line as referred to in the
[2]McNulty deed as the Maryland-Pennsylvania border?
[3]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[4]Instruct you not to answer.
[5]Q Paragraph Number 10 is inaccurate, is it
[6]not, Paragraph 10 of your report?
[7]A Please clarify.
[8]Q Is it accurate or not?
[9]A To the best of my knowledge.
[10]Q Well, you refer to frontage of the Casero
[11]property, but then you refer to the McNulty property.
[12]You are wrong, right?
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. Ambiguous. Answer
[14]if you understand the question.
[15]A It doesn't say "complete frontage" or
[16]"total frontage."
[17]Q Well, do either Exhibits 2 or 3 depict the
[18]McNulty property?
[19]A Exhibit 2 depicts the southern boundary of
[20]the McNulty property.
[21]Q So it doesn't depict the McNulty property,
  75
[1]it only depicts the southern boundary, correct? Or
[2]what you call the frontage?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q Okay. And you referred to the frontage of
[5]the Casero property, but you didn't refer to the
[6]frontage of the McNulty property, correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q So for purposes of Paragraph 10, can you
[9]amend that to refer only to the frontage of the McNulty
[10]property and make it more accurate? Would that make it
[11]more accurate?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q Okay. All right. So along that
[14]frontage -- let me -- let me -- forget the frontage
[15]question. Let me rephrase it.
[16]Between what you describe as the actual
[17]Mason-Dixon line and the surveyed Mason-Dixon line -- I
[18]know you called it one-tenth of an acre, but what's the
[19]furthest width of that sliver of land?
[20]A Based on the Exhibit 2, it's approximately
[21]1356 -- 13.56 feet if I understand the question
  76
[1]correctly.
[2]Q Where is the 13.56?
[3]A That's on the eastern end of the strip.
[4]Q On the east end? Is that what you said?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q Okay. So I'm looking at Exhibit Number 3.
[7]Walk me through that.
[8]A I'm looking at Exhibit Number 2.
[9]Q Excuse me. Number 2. You are right. Go
[10]ahead.
[11]A What's the question? I thought I answered
[12]it.
[13]Q No, I said walk me through that.
[14]A Oh, I'm sorry.
[15]Q Just so I can understand your Exhibit
[16]Number 2 better.
[17]A The north arrows in the upper left corner.
[18]There is a strip that's not quite parallel. I
[19]understood you to ask the largest depth. No, you
[20]didn't use the word depth of the strip.
[21]Q I think I see where you are referring to.
  77
[1]It says 13.56 there over --
[2]A That's correct.
[3]Q Right in the gray area?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q Okay. I got you. I got you now. Okay.
[6]Let me ask this. What is the furthest distance south
[7]of the edge of Salt Lake Road -- the south edge of Salt
[8]Lake Road that you contend the McNultys own?
[9]A That is depicted on the west end, but there
[10]is no actual distance. There are two different -- two
[11]distances there within a foot. So if you subtract
[12]41 -- if you subtract 33.5 from 41.5, it's
[13]approximately 8 feet.
[14]Q You are saying that the -- that the west
[15]end of the Casero property -- excuse me, of the McNulty
[16]property -- the west end of the McNulty property, their
[17]land goes about 8 feet south of Salt Lake Road?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Okay. And does it ever stay within the bed
[20]of Salt Lake Road --
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[78]
[1]Q -- completely?
[2]MR. CHANG: Ambiguous.
[3]A Repeat the question, please.
[4]Q All right. Let me get a couple of other
[5]things straight on your report -- on your survey.
[6]Exhibit 2, there is a -- there is two vert -- two
[7]northerly -- north-south lines kind of about two-thirds
[8]to the right of the -- is that a stream?
[9]A The lines with three dots are the
[10]approximate edges of the stream by field survey.
[11]Q Okay. All right. I see where you are --
[12]it says "bituminous paved driveway," right?
[13]A Yes. We located it.
[14]Q How much -- are you able to determine how
[15]far south of the edge of Salt Lake Road that bituminous
[16]driveway is? Let me rephrase that.
[17]Have you been able to determine how far --
[18]at that point in Salt Lake Road how much asphalt is on
[19]the McNultys' land?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection to form.
[21]A I did not calculate that for the driveway,
  79
[1]no.
[2]Q Okay. So you are not going to testify
[3]about that, right?
[4]A It wasn't calculated.
[5]Q Okay. Do you know -- besides supposedly
[6]taking down the McNultys' fence, and besides putting
[7]that asphalt driveway there, do you know what other
[8]trespass has occurred?
[9]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[10]Instruct the client -- instruct the witness not to
[11]answer.
[12]MR. COLLINS: All right. So you are not
[13]going to claim damages for trespass?
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[15]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't.
[16]MR. CHANG: Instruct the witness not to
[17]answer.
[18]Q Do you know -- gosh. Assuming that some
[19]part of the Casero driveway goes on the McNulty land,
[20]do you have any opinions sitting here today to tell me
[21]how much of a trespass that is? How many -- how many
  80
[1]square feet?
[2]A Not without a scale drawing. I could scale
[3]it.
[4]Q Do you know whether or not the McNultys'
[5]line, according to you, ever is wholly within Salt Lake
[6]Road?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[8]Instruct you not to answer.
[9]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't. It goes to how
[10]much is being trespassed upon.
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection is the same.
[12]Instruct you not to answer.
[13]MR. COLLINS: You are so wasting my time.
[14]You have no right to do this, and I'm going to ask for
[15]sanctions if you don't stop it. I'm going to ask for
[16]sanctions personally against you for what you are
[17]doing.
[18]MR. CHANG: We have discussed this.
[19]MR. COLLINS: No. I'm going to tell you
[20]right now, I am asking for sanctions against you
[21]personally if you keep instructing him not to answer
[81]
[1]questions that have direct relationship to damages.
[2]MR. CHANG: Please explain how that relates
[3]to damages, your last question.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Clearly does because it has
[5]to do with whether or not there should be a
[6]prescriptive easement and how much land is being
[7]trespassed upon.
[8]MR. CHANG: I believe you asked and he
[9]answered that question.
[10]MR. COLLINS: No, he hasn't. You told him
[11]not to.
[12]MR. CHANG: Maybe rephrase it. The way you
[13]phrased it --
[14]MR. COLLINS: No, I'm not going to rephrase
[15]it. Are you going to answer it, or are you going to
[16]instruct him not to answer it.
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm going to instruct him not
[18]to answer your last question.
[19]MR. COLLINS: Okay. Fine. Fine. That's
[20]your choice.
[21]MR. CHANG: Because it goes to liability.
  82
[1]Q I'll move on to my next question. My next
[2]question is this. Is there a spot along Salt Lake Road
[3]that the Caseros could build a driveway to get to Salt
[4]Lake Road without trespassing upon the McNulty property
[5]that would be west of the -- the stream?
[6]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes outside of the
[7]scope of his report.
[8]MR. COLLINS: So he doesn't have an
[9]opinion, and he's not going to render any at trial
[10]about this, right?
[11]MR. CHANG: At this point, yeah, that's
[12]correct. I instruct you not to answer.
[13]MR. COLLINS: Okay. Keep it up. Keep it
[14]up.
[15]Q Are you planning on rendering any opinions
[16]related to the -- whether or not the trespass affected
[17]the McNultys' use and enjoyment of their property?
[18]MR. CHANG: Objection. Instruct you not to
[19]answer.
[20]MR. COLLINS: So he has no opinions
[21]regarding whether this alleged trespass --
  83
[1]MR. CHANG: You are asking him if he plans
[2]on testifying on a certain issue in the future.
[3]MR. COLLINS: All right.
[4]Q Do you have an opinion, sitting here today,
[5]about whether the Caseros' conduct affected the
[6]McNultys use and enjoyment of their property?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[8]Instruct you not to answer.
[9]MR. COLLINS: That's directly related to
[10]damages, but you can -- you can instruct him all you
[11]want.
[12]MR. CHANG: Let me specify as well.
[13]MR. COLLINS: Clearly does.
[14]MR. CHANG: Let me specify as well. Mr.
[15]Farcht is here as a surveyor.
[16]MR. COLLINS: I understand. So he's not
[17]going to be testifying about the use and enjoyment of
[18]the property. That's fine.
[19]Q Now, do you know how wide a road easement
[20]is in Pennsylvania?
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection. Yeah. Objection.
  84
[1]Q You can answer.
[2]A They are variable.
[3]Q Do you know how wide the road easement is
[4]on this particular road, Line Road or Salt Lake Road?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[6]A We spoke to the county.
[7]Q Which county?
[8]A Well, actually, we spoke to both counties.
[9]Harford and York. And there -- and the township. And
[10]there are minimal records in this area. Please repeat
[11]the question.
[12]Q Do you know how wide the right-of-way
[13]easement is?
[14]MR. CHANG: Yeah, I'm actually going to
[15]object because this goes outside the bounds of his
[16]report. I instruct you not to answer.
[17]Q Do you know how wide the right-of-way
[18]easement is or not?
[19]MR. CHANG: Same objection.
[20]Q You can answer.
[21]A Based on experience of PennDOT and turnpike
  85
[1]projects, it's often the traveled cartway, for lack of
[2]better documentation.
[3]Q You didn't see in the deeds that it's a
[4]50-foot right-of-way in all of this research you did?
[5]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object again.
[6]This is outside the bounds. I instruct you not to
[7]answer.
[8]MR. COLLINS: Does go directly to damages
[9]because land that is subject to a right-of-way is worth
[10]less than land that is not subject to a right-of-way,
[11]and, therefore, it directly relates to damages.
[12]Q I'm asking, do you know how wide the
[13]right-of-way is for this particular road?
[14]MR. CHANG: Again, I'm going to instruct
[15]you not to answer. It's outside the bounds of your
[16]report.
[17]MR. COLLINS: Doesn't matter if it's
[18]outside the bounds of his report. He can still answer
[19]the question if he knows.
[20]MR. CHANG: I'm instructing you not to
[21]answer.
  86
[1]Q Is it contained in the chain back that you
[2]reviewed?
[3]MR. CHANG: Instruct you not to answer.
[4]Q Did you review the chain back of deeds for
[5]both the Casero and McNulty properties in rendering
[6]your opinions?
[7]MR. CHANG: Asked and answered.
[8]Q The answer was yes, right?
[9]A That's correct.
[10]Q In those documents, was there a
[11]right-of-way referenced for that road?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q Was it 50 feet?
[14]A In some areas.
[15]Q Is there any reason for you to believe that
[16]in front of the Casero property the road right-of-way
[17]is not 50-feet wide?
[18]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object.
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q What is the basis for your belief?
[21]A When talking to the municipal person, they
  87
[1]said their -- implied their records were very vague.
[2]And they only went by recorded subdivisions. And the
[3]recorded subdivisions were only on the north side of
[4]the road, which potentially define the width on north.
[5]But there is no recorded subdivision in the Casero
[6]property area. Even though it says 50 foot in some
[7]instances throughout the chain, there is no recorded
[8]subdivision with a dedication of right-of-way on the
[9]south.
[10]Q Okay. So did you mark on your report the
[11]width of the right-of-way?
[12]A No.
[13]Q Do you normally, when you put a road down
[14]on your surveys, mark the width of a right-of-way?
[15]A When we can verify it.
[16]Q Okay. So isn't it true that even what you
[17]call this .1 of an acre, isn't all of that land subject
[18]to a right-of-way? Public right-of-way?
[19]A I have no records that go beyond the
[20]cartway, which is -- PennDOT holds in township roads
[21]for the south, to say that it goes beyond the travel
  88
[1]cartway. On the north I have recorded subdivisions
[2]that mention a dedicated right-of-way. And they are
[3]recorded. And the Fawn township people go by that.
[4]But I have no -- nothing to verify that to the south.
[5]Q Okay. For the north, how wide was it?
[6]A There was a dedication of 50 foot. But
[7]PennDOT and other municipalities and most case law say
[8]that unless it's accepted by the municipality, it's not
[9]official. There has to be an offer of dedication of
[10]right-of-way and an acceptance. And many times in our
[11]PennDOT work, even though it shows 50 foot on a
[12]right-of-way, PennDOT doesn't accept it until it's --
[13]the plan is -- there is a note on their plan to say
[14]hereby -- by this recording of this plan, we hereby
[15]accept this dedicated right-of-way. So dedicated
[16]right-of-way is often in limbo. That's why it's not
[17]shown. There is no record of acceptance.
[18]Q Isn't there a law in Pennsylvania that
[19]establishes the minimum right-of-way for a road?
[20]A There is a law on 33 feet based on the type
[21]and municipality, but there is also cases where it's
[89]
[1]only the cartway width. And sometimes it's the
[2]supporting slopes. There is no supporting slopes in
[3]this area per se. Right-of-way records in this area
[4]are very ambiguous.
[5]Q Assuming that there is a 50-foot
[6]right-of-way on both sides of -- for both sides of the
[7]road, does any of your disputed property as reflected
[8]in your Exhibit 2 fall outside of the 50-foot
[9]right-of-way?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[11]speculation.
[12]Q You can answer.
[13]MR. CHANG: Outside of the scope of his
[14]report.
[15]A I could not make the assumption that width
[16]is south.
[17]Q I didn't ask you to assume it. Well,
[18]actually, I am asking you to assume it just for
[19]purposes of this hypothetical question. Assuming for
[20]purposes of this hypothetical question that there is a
[21]50-foot right-of-way because of Salt Lake Road, would
  90
[1]any of this disputed property that you identified in
[2]Exhibit Number 2 of your report be outside of the
[3]50-foot right-of-way?
[4]MR. CHANG: Objection. Outside the scope
[5]of the report.
[6]Q You can answer.
[7]A If it -- if there is record of the 50 foot
[8]on both sides, yes.
[9]Q There is land -- the McNulty land does go
[10]outside of the right-of-way? I asked if the McNulty
[11]land goes beyond the right-of-way?
[12]MR. CHANG: Objection. Objection.
[13]Relevance.
[14]A Rephrase that, please.
[15]Q Assuming for purposes of this hypothetical
[16]question that there is a 50-foot right-of-way related
[17]to Salt Lake Road, do you have an opinion regarding
[18]whether or not the McNultys' property falls outside of
[19]that right-of-way on the south side of Salt Lake Road?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[21]Objection. Goes outside the scope of the report.
[91]
[1]A It's if 50 foot centered on the cartway, it
[2]would not go outside of it.
[3]Q Okay. Now, ask -- I'm going to ask the
[4]same question. Assuming that it is a 33-foot
[5]right-of-way --
[6]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[7]Q -- do have an opinion regarding whether or
[8]not any of the McNulty property lies outside of the
[9]right-of-way?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[11]speculation. Objection. Outside the scope of the
[12]report.
[13]Q You can answer.
[14]A If it's 33 centered on the cartway, I'm not
[15]sure because Harford County claimed no maintenance.
[16]And they would have to have right-of-way to claim
[17]maintenance.
[18]Q I'm just talking about physically. When
[19]you go 33 feet from the center of the road -- from the
[20]center of Salt Lake Road, is any of your disputed
[21]property, as depicted in Exhibit 2 to your report,
[92]
[1]outside of that 33-foot right-of-way?
[2]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[3]Objection. Calls for speculation. It's outside the
[4]report. And you're beginning to badger the witness.
[5]Q You can answer.
[6]A I think it's the same answer. If it's 33
[7]feet from center, it would be within that.
[8]Q The McNultys' property would be within the
[9]right-of-way?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Okay. From what you understand about the
[12]fence that was supposedly taken -- that was supposedly
[13]trespassed upon, do you know whether the fence lay
[14]wholly within either a 33 or a 50-foot right-of-way,
[15]assuming such right-of-ways existed.
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[17]Outside the scope of his capacity as an expert.
[18]Instruct you not to answer.
[19]Q Do you have a general idea of where the
[20]fence was?
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection. Same objection for
  93
[1]the same reasons. I instruct you not to answer.
[2]MR. COLLINS: So he's not going to be
[3]answering any questions regarding -- at trial -- I'm
[4]going to be objecting to him asking -- answering any
[5]questions regarding whether or not the fence was in the
[6]right-of-way or not within the right-of-way. He cannot
[7]answer any questions related to that then unless you
[8]let him answer that.
[9]MR. CHANG: Same objection. I instruct you
[10]not to answer.
[11]Q All right. Now, you were talking with me
[12]about rights of way and how wide they would be. Have
[13]you looked at whether or not Harford County has a
[14]minimum width of a right-of-way for a road?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. Outside the scope
[16]of the report. I instruct you not to answer.
[17]MR. COLLINS: Just for the record, by the
[18]way, outside of the scope of the report is an invalid
[19]objection. You need to read the rules about objecting
[20]at depositions and stop violating them. It's outside
[21]of what your role is sitting here today. And I'm going
  94
[1]to ask for sanctions for you doing it repeatedly. The
[2]fact that it's outside -- outside of his report doesn't
[3]mean I can't ask about it.
[4]Q So my question is, again, do you know
[5]whether the fence lay within -- assuming for purposes
[6]of this question that there was a 33-foot right-of-way,
[7]was the fence within the 33-foot right-of-way?
[8]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[9]Outside the scope. And I instruct you not to answer.
[10]Q You were referring to rights of way, and
[11]you didn't know what Harford County did as to rights of
[12]way. Is that because the south side of Salt Lake Road
[13]is in Harford County?
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[15]Instruct you not to answer.
[16]Q Did you look at other surveys before
[17]reaching your opinions?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Which other surveys did you review?
[20]A There was a Bay State survey.
[21](The reporter asked for clarification.)
  95
[1]THE WITNESS: Bay State.
[2]A There were several Shaw surveys. And there
[3]were several Highland surveys. And there was a partial
[4]survey by Dudley Campbell.
[5]Q When was that done?
[6]A Dudley Campbell was involved with a dispute
[7]on the western boundary line of the Casero property. I
[8]forget the time.
[9]Q What was that about?
[10]A Apparently there was a dispute over the
[11]north-southwestern line with the Casero property and
[12]the Arch -- former Archer farm.
[13]Q Okay.
[14]A And I looked at a partial survey of that.
[15]MR. COLLINS: I'm gonna have this marked as
[16]Exhibit Number 3.
[17](Farcht Exhibit 3 was marked for purposes
[18]of identification.)
[19]Q You have in front of you Exhibit Number 3,
[20]which is the Maryland geological survey from 1908. Is
[21]this the document that Maryland and Pennsylvania agreed
  96
[1]to was the Maryland-Pennsylvania line?
[2]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[3]Q Not including the actual pages. I'll give
[4]that -- the one that relates to this. I didn't think
[5]it was -- there you go.
[6]A It appears to be.
[7]Q Okay. Did you review this before your
[8]deposition today?
[9]A Sometime ago I reviewed the actual field
[10]notes through that Mason-Dixon Society, which should
[11]have been part of this, I believe, but I don't see
[12]them.
[13](Farcht Exhibit 4 was marked for purposes
[14]of identification.)
[15]Q So I'm looking at what's been marked as
[16]Exhibit Number 4. I believe this is the plat out of
[17]Maryland Geological Survey related to the McNulty
[18]property, right?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q Can you make a mark in pen where the Casero
[21]property is and where the McNulty property is?
  97
[1]MR. CHANG: Objection. I'm going to object
[2]to this again. I think it's going to liability rather
[3]than damages. Unless you can explain otherwise, I
[4]would instruct you not to answer.
[5]MR. COLLINS: You are not going to mark it?
[6]MR. CHANG: I'm going to instruct him not
[7]to answer.
[8]MR. COLLINS: So you -- also, you are going
[9]to tell him not to mark it?
[10]MR. CHANG: Well, at the request for him to
[11]mark it, then yeah. Instruct him not to mark it.
[12]MR. COLLINS: So you are not going to let
[13]him answer any questions regarding this?
[14]MR. CHANG: I mean, if it goes to
[15]liability, then yeah. I mean, if you could explain to
[16]me how this goes to damages, then of course. But it
[17]seems to me this goes to liability.
[18]MR. COLLINS: Well, he talks about a
[19]historically surveyed Mason-Dixon line.
[20]MR. CHANG: Uh-huh. Which again.
[21]MR. COLLINS: This was in 1908.
  98
[1]Q Is this the historically surveyed
[2]Mason-Dixon line from 1908?
[3]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[4]I'm going to instruct you not to answer. Instruct you
[5]not to answer.
[6]MR. COLLINS: It also goes -- just so you
[7]know, it also goes to the question of whether or not my
[8]clients acted reasonably or with malice under your
[9]slander of title count -- okay -- your slander of title
[10]of count, you have to show that they intentionally
[11]misrepresented something. If there is documents out
[12]there that justify their position, then that's relevant
[13]to it. And I'm trying to find out whether or not
[14]that's relevant. And if you are not going to go
[15]forward on slander of title, that's just fine with me.
[16]But if you are not planning on putting on any evidence
[17]of malice, that's fine. But you are not going to get
[18]slander of title. So I need to address this malice
[19]issue.
[20]MR. CHANG: I disagree with your legal
[21]conclusions. The objection remains the same, as is
  99
[1]instruction not to answer the question.
[2]MR. COLLINS: Okay. That's fine. You are
[3]not going to be able to put on any evidence of malice.
[4]That's fine.
[5]Q Okay. All right. Now, the -- in the
[6]Pennsylvania lawsuit, the -- that was filed by the
[7]McNultys against the Caseros alleged that there was a
[8]10-foot wide swath of land that they -- excuse me.
[9]There they alleged it was a 6-foot strip south of Salt
[10]Lake Road. Was that incorrect?
[11]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry. What are you
[12]referring to?
[13]MR. COLLINS: The -- the lawsuit that the
[14]McNultys filed against the Caseros in Pennsylvania
[15]Federal Court.
[16]MR. CHANG: Can you point to a paragraph?
[17]MR. COLLINS: Sure. Paragraph 9.
[18]MR. CHANG: Do you have that in front of
[19]you? Is this an exhibit?
[20]MR. COLLINS: Not yet. I may make it an
[21]exhibit. We'll decide.
  100
[1]MR. CHANG: Well, I'm just curious.
[2]Q I'm asking you, is that accurate or not?
[3]They allege in Paragraph 9 of their complaint that
[4]there was a 6-foot -- approximate 6-foot strip lies
[5]south of the paved cartway.
[6]MR. CHANG: FJ, this is a complaint. There
[7]is an emended complaint. This is no longer operative.
[8]MR. COLLINS: I understand, but they
[9]alleged something.
[10]MR. CHANG: Okay. Well --
[11]MR. COLLINS: I want to ask.
[12]Q Is that accurate?
[13]MR. CHANG: Just for the record, FJ is
[14]asking a question about a complaint that's been filed
[15]in this lawsuit and not the amended complaint.
[16]MR. COLLINS: No, this was not filed in
[17]this lawsuit. This was filed in Pennsylvania. I'm
[18]referring to a Pennsylvania complaint in Federal Court
[19]that the McNultys filed against the Caseros in which
[20]they alleged that there was a 6-foot strip of land.
[21]Q Was it 6 feet and later changed to 10 feet,
  101
[1]or were they -- were they just wrong in what they
[2]alleged?
[3]MR. CHANG: Objection. Form. Can you
[4]rephrase the question?
[5]Q Well, Paragraph 9 of the complaint in
[6]Pennsylvania alleges that there was an approximate
[7]6-foot strip of land that lies to the south of the
[8]paved cartway that they own.
[9]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[10]Instruct you not to answer.
[11]Q Is it 6 feet, 10 feet, or something else?
[12]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[13]I instruct you not to answer.
[14]MR. COLLINS: Doesn't go to liability.
[15]Goes to damages. Clearly the amount of land that they
[16]are claiming is relevant to the damages.
[17]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[18]Same objection.
[19]Q All right. In another paragraph, they
[20]alleged in Pennsylvania that they owned land in the
[21]State of Maryland. Do you agree with them?
  102
[1]MR. CHANG: Can you --
[2]Q Sure. Paragraph -- Page 4.
[3]MR. CHANG: If you are referencing certain
[4]allegations, I think you need to give the witness an
[5]opportunity to read it. You said Page 4?
[6]MR. COLLINS: Yes.
[7]MR. CHANG: What paragraph, please?
[8]MR. COLLINS: It's in the wherefor clause.
[9]Q Do you agree with the McNultys that they
[10]own land in Maryland?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[12]Instruct you not to answer. Objection stands. So does
[13]the instruction.
[14]MR. COLLINS: All right. Then I think I
[15]will have this marked as an exhibit then.
[16](Farcht Exhibit 5 and 6 were marked for
[17]purposes of identification.)
[18]Q Exhibit 6. Do those markings on that page,
[19]taken from the Maryland Geological Survey, which is
[20]Exhibit Number 3, do those markings accurately reflect
[21]the property of the parties?
  103
[1]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[2]I instruct you not to answer. Also, what is this
[3]document?
[4]MR. COLLINS: This is out of that book.
[5]Out of the Maryland Geological Survey. It's the --
[6]it's the plate that specifically refers to the land
[7]which is now owned by the Caseros and the McNultys.
[8]MR. CHANG: But all the writing was done
[9]obviously by --
[10]MR. COLLINS: Us.
[11]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Instruct you
[12]not to answer.
[13]MR. COLLINS: He's instructing you not to
[14]answer. So you don't need to take any time looking
[15]through that book, obviously. We'll have this marked
[16]as next document.
[17](Farcht Exhibit 7 was marked for purposes
[18]of identification.)
[19]Q Farcht Exhibit Number 7, is this the survey
[20]that you were referring to in your -- in your Exhibit
[21]Number 2 to your -- your report that establishes where
  104
[1]the surveyed Mason-Dixon line is?
[2]A Please clarify that question.
[3]Q In your report, in your -- in your Exhibit
[4]A to the amended complaint, and in your report, you
[5]refer to something that we have been calling the
[6]surveyed Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q Is this the plat from which you derived
[9]that?
[10]A This is one of the documents.
[11]Q Okay. Now, I will notice [sic] that this
[12]plat does not refer -- it refers to York County and
[13]Harford County. It refers to State of Maryland and
[14]Penn -- and the State of Pennsylvania, correct?
[15]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object again. I
[16]think this is going toward liability. I instruct you
[17]not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: I think you -- okay. You are
[19]going to tell him that he cannot say whether or not
[20]this document refers to that? Really?
[21]MR. CHANG: What are you getting at?
  105
[1]MR. COLLINS: He said he just relied upon
[2]this in reaching his conclusions. How can he not
[3]answer questions about it?
[4]MR. CHANG: For a number of reasons. But
[5]go ahead and ask.
[6]MR. COLLINS: Why, because they hurt your
[7]case?
[8]A Please repeat the question.
[9]Q This document, Exhibit Number 7, refers to
[10]York County and Harford County on the left, and the
[11]State of Maryland and State of Pennsylvania on the
[12]right, correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q It also refers to the Mason-Dixon line,
[15]right?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q And that's all the same line it's referring
[18]to, correct?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q And this is the Shaw survey, correct?
[21]A Yes.
  106
[1]Q Did you consider this survey in reaching
[2]your conclusions?
[3]A That was part of the review.
[4]Q Okay. Did you consider the fact that Shaw
[5]Surveying wrote a statement that this was inaccurate?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q Okay. And that didn't influence your
[8]decision, or your opinions?
[9]A It was definitely considered, but it's the
[10]same two lines and the semantics of those.
[11]Q What do you mean the same two lines? Which
[12]two lines?
[13]A We have a monumented line that's monumented
[14]beyond what Shaw did for Archer. And another property
[15]to the east. And then we have the reestablished line
[16]from the crown or mile markers.
[17]Q I don't know what you mean. Can you
[18]explain that better?
[19]A Please repeat the first question.
[20]Q No, I need you to explain the -- the
[21]answer -- your answer better. I don't understand.
  107
[1]MR. CHANG: Do you understand what his
[2]question was that you're answering? If you don't, ask
[3]him to repeat it.
[4]A I would appreciate it if you could repeat
[5]it to restate my answer.
[6]Q I'm not sure I can, but I certainly didn't
[7]understand your question.
[8]MR. CHANG: It's probably on the record.
[9]MR. COLLINS: Go ahead, Dawn, if you don't
[10]mind.
[11](The reporter read back as requested.)
[12]A Okay. Based on my surveys, there is the
[13]clearly defined line between the two Mason-Dixon
[14]stones. And there is the clearly defined line from
[15]boundary evidence in the field that has been claimed as
[16]a Mason-Dixon line also.
[17]Q Okay. This one refers to the one that you
[18]identified in the field, correct?
[19]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object again.
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q The one that you also referred to as the
  108
[1]surveyed Mason-Dixon line rather than the actual
[2]Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[3]MR. CHANG: Objection. Again, goes to
[4]liability. I instruct you not to answer.
[5]Q Did you consider this survey --
[6]MR. COLLINS: He already testified that he
[7]considered this survey in reaching his opinions. You
[8]can't stop him from answering questions about it.
[9]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[10]instruction. In the meantime, can you remind me what
[11]Exhibit 2 -- 1 and 2 were?
[12](Farcht Exhibit 8 was marked for purposes
[13]of identification.)
[14]Q I'm going to show you what has been marked
[15]as Exhibit Number 8, which is a Shaw survey by John P.
[16]Myers dated in 2014 for the land directly to the east
[17]of the -- of the McNultys. Do you follow that?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Okay. You see the stream there?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q Okay. All right. Now, in this survey
  109
[1]Shaw -- John Myers refers to a Mason-Dixon line stone
[2]on either side of the properties, correct?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q And so when he writes the Mason-Dixon line
[5]stone there -- you know, line there, he uses the
[6]monuments, correct?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. I'm going to object
[8]because, again, this is speculation. He didn't
[9]establish that he did this survey. So -- and, also, I
[10]think this is going to liability. Instruct the
[11]client -- instruct the witness not to answer.
[12]MR. COLLINS: It goes to damages because it
[13]has to do with how much land is being trespassed upon,
[14]and whether or not it was reasonable of this witness to
[15]consider one document versus the other. The Shaw
[16]survey from before did not refer to the Mason-Dixon
[17]stones, but this one does.
[18]Q Is it normal to refer to the Mason-Dixon
[19]line stones when you are trying to find the -- the --
[20]the Mason-Dixon line?
[21]A Yes.
  110
[1]Q Okay. He did it in this -- John Myers did
[2]it in this survey, correct?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q Okay. In Exhibit Number 7, he doesn't do
[5]it, correct?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q Is there some reason you would think that
[8]Exhibit Number 7 would be accurate then if he hasn't
[9]referred to the Mason-Dixon line stone monuments?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[11]MR. COLLINS: Goes to credibility as well.
[12]MR. CHANG: Whose credibility?
[13]MR. COLLINS: His credibility.
[14]MR. CHANG: Who is "his"?
[15]MR. COLLINS: The witness. I'm entitled to
[16]ask about things that go to credibility.
[17]MR. CHANG: Can you repeat the question?
[18]Q Is there some reason you -- you -- you
[19]included in your reports and your analysis a survey
[20]that doesn't even refer to the monuments when the same
[21]surveyor does refer to it in other places?
  111
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q What is that reason?
[3]A There is no dispute within my findings that
[4]there are two recognized lines that were called the
[5]Mason-Dixon line.
[6]Q Say that again. I didn't follow that.
[7]A There is no doubt in my findings that there
[8]have been two lines recognized as the Mason-Dixon line
[9]through history in this area.
[10]Q How about in any other area? Have you ever
[11]heard of that, any other area?
[12]A Yes, I have.
[13]Q Where?
[14]A If you read some of the Mason-Dixon
[15]reports, it's 900 foot off in Gettysburg, and it varies
[16]down to Cumberland I think 300 feet from the true line.
[17]Q Hasn't it been established in that 1908
[18]survey?
[19]A It's been established where the stones are,
[20]but they are not -- even the stones aren't correctly
[21]positioned on the -- what would have been the real
  112
[1]longitudinal line. So there is -- there is recognized
[2]discrepancies even in the stones when the Mason-Dixon
[3]survey proceeded west.
[4]Q Yeah. But in 1908 they resurveyed it,
[5]right?
[6]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. I'm going
[7]to object. This is all going to liability.
[8]Q Well, you are referring to stuff going back
[9]to 1600s, right?
[10]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[11]Q Are you referring to things going back to
[12]1600s?
[13]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[14]MR. COLLINS: He just referred to
[15]something. I need to understand what he was saying.
[16]And it goes to his credibility.
[17]MR. CHANG: I was trying to determine where
[18]this line of questioning was going. It's clearly going
[19]to liability. I'm instructing you not to answer.
[20]MR. COLLINS: Also goes to his credibility
[21]and damages. You are not going to let him answer it
  113
[1]again? The answer is no?
[2]MR. CHANG: The answer is no.
[3]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[4]Q I was going to show you this, but I don't
[5]have enough copies of it. Do you recognize that
[6]document?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q And is that document, Mr. Shaw saying he
[9]made a mistake, or Shaw Surveying saying -- saying he
[10]made a mistake?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. If you are going to
[12]--
[13]MR. COLLINS: You have a copy of it. We
[14]can make it an exhibit if you want, but --
[15]MR. CHANG: If you could. I don't -- I
[16]don't have a copy with me. Can you make this an
[17]exhibit --
[18]MR. COLLINS: Sure.
[19]MR. CHANG: -- if you are going to ask him
[20]questions about it?
[21]MR. COLLINS: Yeah.
  114
[1]MR. CHANG: And I still reserve my right to
[2]object depending on what your question is.
[3]MR. COLLINS: I understand.
[4](Farcht Exhibit 9 was marked for purposes
[5]of identification.)
[6]Q The question is did you consider that in
[7]reaching your opinions?
[8]MR. CHANG: Again, I'm going to object
[9]because this goes to liability. And I'm going to
[10]instruct the client not to answer, or the witness.
[11]MR. COLLINS: Whether or not he considered
[12]it in making his opinions is relevant to his testimony
[13]today. If he can say that he didn't consider it, then
[14]that's fine. But it's certainly relevant.
[15]MR. CHANG: You are asking -- sorry. Can
[16]you repeat the question then?
[17]Q Did you consider this document when
[18]reaching your conclusions in writing your report?
[19]MR. CHANG: You can answer.
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q Okay. And in what way did you consider it?
  115
[1]A Are you asking how I considered it?
[2]Q Yes.
[3]A Okay. I believe that they had not located
[4]those stones in the past. I think I wrote somewhere.
[5]But they did this time. And they are now revising the
[6]location based on the stones, but I did not believe it
[7]revised the boundary between the parcels.
[8]Q I think implicit in that answer is your
[9]belief that the boundary between the parcels is that
[10]there is no gap between the two parcels?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Form.
[12]Mischaracterization.
[13]MR. COLLINS: I'm going to rephrase it just
[14]because it was -- did come out badly.
[15]Q But implicit in your answer, or in your
[16]complete testimony today, is the belief that there is
[17]no gap between the McNultys' southern border and the
[18]Caseros' northern border?
[19]A There is a slight line on this exhibit to
[20]that pipe, which is Exhibit 2, I believe, of Exhibit 1.
[21]MR. CHANG: It is Exhibit 2 of his report,
  116
[1]just to clarify.
[2]A There is the potential for a slight gap
[3]from the monumented line in the past, excluding the
[4]survey markers of the Mason-Dixon. But all the other
[5]surveyors --
[6]When the parcel is positioned on these
[7]markers in the field, they are not precise between pipe
[8]to pipe. There is a -- there is a few inches here and
[9]there. So you have flexibility in reestablishing this
[10]boundary. It can't fit perfectly.
[11]So there -- there is potential of a slight
[12]gap, as shown on here, between the conveyance of title
[13]to Casero and what has historically been accepted as
[14]the southern boundary of McNulty.
[15]Q Where is that gap?
[16]A It's shown on this Exhibit 2 of -- I
[17]mean --
[18]Q Explain where you mean on your -- please
[19]explain what you mean in terms of the -- how it's shown
[20]on your Exhibit Number 2?
[21]A You see the bracketed bearing and distance?
  117
[1]Q Hang on. Let me get it.
[2]A Sorry.
[3]Q All right. I got it.
[4]A You see the bracketed bearing and distance
[5]with 8.05 feet?
[6]Q Yeah.
[7]A Above that there is lighter line right
[8]above 434.72.
[9]Q Point it -- point to it if you wouldn't
[10]mind.
[11]A Right there.
[12]Q Okay. It's upside down.
[13]A That's correct. If that's the gap you are
[14]referring to, there is the potential of a gap there.
[15]Q Okay. Any other gaps?
[16]A No. Not that I'm recalling. Just an
[17]overlap.
[18]Q Okay. Do you know of any -- how do you
[19]explain your opinion regarding the amount of land being
[20]trespassed upon in light of the statement in the
[21]McNulty deed that their southern border runs in and
  118
[1]through Salt Lake Road?
[2]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[3]Instruct you not to answer.
[4]Q Well, if their border runs in and through
[5]Salt Lake Road, how much land do they own south of Salt
[6]Lake Road?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. Objection. Goes to
[8]liability. I instruct you not to answer.
[9]MR. COLLINS: Do you know the answer and
[10]you are just not going to let him answer it?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[12]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't go to liability.
[13]It goes to credibility, and it also goes to damages.
[14]MR. CHANG: I instruct you not to answer.
[15]Q Okay. I mean, just to be clear, the term
[16]"in and through Salt Lake Road" was in the chain back
[17]that you looked back -- looked at, right?
[18]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object to the
[19]entire line of questioning as going to liability. And
[20]instruct you not to answer.
[21]MR. COLLINS: But it's part of what he
  119
[1]referred to in his report.
[2]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[3]instruction.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Just to be clear on the
[5]record, this witness has written in his report that he
[6]looked at the chain back documents related to the
[7]McNulty title and the Casero title. The McNulty title
[8]specifically refers to their southern boundary as
[9]running in and through Salt Lake Road. And I'm trying
[10]to find out from this witness how much land he believes
[11]the McNultys own south of the line that runs in and
[12]through Salt Lake Road.
[13]MR. CHANG: I'm objecting to the question
[14]because it goes to liability. And I'm instructing the
[15]witness not to answer.
[16]MR. COLLINS: I'm only asking about how
[17]much. I'm not asking --
[18]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[19]instruction.
[20]MR. COLLINS: And you don't think that how
[21]much land is relevant to damages?
  120
[1]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[2]instruction. We can talk about it later.
[3]Q Let me show you --
[4]MR. COLLINS: We'll have this marked.
[5](Farcht Exhibit 10 was marked for purposes
[6]of identification.)
[7]MR. CHANG: FJ, just to be sure, it's
[8]11:20. You noticed Bill Harvey for 11 a.m.
[9]MR. COLLINS: He'll have to wait.
[10]MR. CHANG: I would like to take a break to
[11]let him know that we are running long.
[12]MR. COLLINS: Okay. Is he out there?
[13]MR. CHANG: Yes, he is.
[14](A recess was taken.)
[15]Q Asking you about Exhibit Number 10.
[16]MR. CHANG: Do you have copies?
[17]MR. COLLINS: Yeah.
[18]MR. CHANG: Thank you.
[19]Q The -- just to be clear, the -- this is the
[20]survey, apparently, of a second lot that the McNultys
[21]purchased marked in red. Do you see it?
  121
[1]A I see it, but it's not in red.
[2]Q Mine is. All right. But you see which one
[3]I'm talking about?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q Okay. And for that they paid $ 800. Okay.
[6]My question to you is do you know whether the fence lay
[7]directly south of that lot or the first lot?
[8]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[9]MR. COLLINS: No, it doesn't.
[10]MR. CHANG: Instruct the expert not to
[11]answer the question.
[12]MR. COLLINS: It goes to -- it goes to
[13]damages because it goes to how long they were being
[14]trespassed upon and whether they even owned the -- the
[15]fence, according to you, at the time that the Caseros
[16]sprayed it. You alleged that they sprayed it. They
[17]didn't own it until 2013, if they ever owned it at all.
[18]But they didn't own it until 2013. The spraying took
[19]place before that. So it goes to that. I'm trying to
[20]find out whether or not the fence lay south or within
[21]this plat.
  122
[1]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[2]instruction. Don't answer the question.
[3]MR. COLLINS: Don't answer the question.
[4]Good. Okay. That means you are not going to be
[5]claiming any damages related to the spraying.
[6]Q All right. Did you see a survey by Holley
[7]& Associates?
[8]A Part of it, I believe.
[9]Q Did you see any markers set by Holley &
[10]Associates?
[11]A Yes. There were some to the east.
[12]Q Okay. Isn't it true that Holley &
[13]Associates, when they set their -- what they thought to
[14]be the line, they did it by reference to Markers 36 and
[15]38?
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[17]I instruct you not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: No, this doesn't go just to
[19]liability. It goes to his credibility, and it goes to
[20]my client's good faith.
[21]Q And it's going to be relevant because what
  123
[1]I'm going to ask you next is that you referred to 37,
[2]correct? Marker 36 and 37, right? Or 37 and 38?
[3]A Correct.
[4]Q Right? Holley & Associates was able to
[5]find exactly the same line by referring to different
[6]monuments, correct?
[7]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object again. It
[8]goes to liability. I instruct you not to answer.
[9]MR. COLLINS: Goes to good faith.
[10]Q Did you find that to be the case?
[11]MR. CHANG: I'm objecting on the same
[12]grounds with the same instruction.
[13]MR. COLLINS: Okay. And my question will
[14]be -- I believe his answer to that will be, yes, it was
[15]the same line that they found. And it's referred to as
[16]the actual Mason-Dixon line on his report.
[17]Q Is that true?
[18]MR. CHANG: You are badgering the witness
[19]at this point.
[20]MR. COLLINS: No, I'm trying to get on the
[21]record what I'm going to be asking and what you're
  124
[1]objecting to.
[2]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[3]instruction.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Okay. And my -- I believe
[5]the answer to that would be correct, that, in fact,
[6]it's the same line. And then I'm going to also show
[7]that, in fact, this witness --
[8]Q That modern surveying techniques were not
[9]required to find that line, are they?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Same objection.
[11]Same instruction.
[12]Q Is it necessary to use modern surveying
[13]techniques to properly find the straight line between
[14]the Mason-Dixon line monuments?
[15]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[16]instruction.
[17]Q Do you believe that there is a difference
[18]between modern surveying techniques and historical
[19]surveying -- survey techniques that would result in a
[20]difference in this case?
[21]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
  125
[1]instruction.
[2]Q Okay. What does IBC set mean?
[3](The reporter asked for clarification.)
[4]MR. COLLINS: B as in boy.
[5]A Iron bar and cap.
[6]Q Oh, okay. What is IB, just iron bar?
[7]A Generally speaking.
[8]Q Okay. In your professional opinion, when
[9]reaching the conclusions you did here regarding the .1
[10]acre that you believe is being trespassed upon, did the
[11]bar and cap and railroad spikes placed by Holley &
[12]Associates between the plaintiffs' and defendants'
[13]properties in December of 2014 confirm that the
[14]Mason-Dixon line was where you contend it to be as the
[15]actual Mason-Dixon line?
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[17]Instruct you not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: Take a break for a second.
[19](A recess was taken.)
[20]Q Did you review Holley & Associates' surveys
[21]in reaching your conclusions?
  126
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Did those surveys confirm that the McNulty
[3]property line is south of the edge of the Salt Lake
[4]Road?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[6]Instruct the witness not to answer.
[7]MR. COLLINS: He just said he reviewed it
[8]and it was part of his report.
[9]MR. CHANG: You are asking it as a
[10]liability and not as a damages. You are trying to do
[11]an end run around basically.
[12]MR. COLLINS: No, I'm not.
[13]MR. CHANG: It's the same objection. Same
[14]instruction.
[15]MR. COLLINS: You are going tell him again
[16]not to answer that question?
[17]MR. CHANG: Well, it depends what the
[18]question is.
[19]MR. COLLINS: I just asked it.
[20]MR. CHANG: Can you repeat it?
[21]MR. COLLINS: No, I can't.
  127
[1]MR. CHANG: Then I --
[2]MR. COLLINS: You are going to instruct him
[3]not to answer again.
[4]MR. CHANG: There was a -- whatever the
[5]last question was, the objection was that it goes to
[6]liability. And the instruction was not to answer.
[7]MR. COLLINS: Goes to how much land is
[8]being trespassed upon, and whether or not my clients
[9]had malice. You know that.
[10]Q If Holley & Associates informed them --
[11]MR. COLLINS: Let me just be clear about
[12]this because it's really clear already, but I'll do it
[13]again. If Holley & Associates and Highland informed
[14]them of where the line is and they took action based
[15]upon that, that shows their good faith. You have to
[16]prove lack of good faith for purposes of your slander
[17]of title count. If you don't prove lack of good faith,
[18]then you are not going to get slander of title damages.
[19]And I'm trying to address this lack of good faith or
[20]good faith issue. He has information about it, and he
[21]needs to testify about it. Are you going to refuse to
  128
[1]let him testify about it?
[2]MR. CHANG: Depends what the question is.
[3]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[4]Q The question is did you look at Holley &
[5]Associates' surveys?
[6]MR. CHANG: Asked and answered. Objection.
[7]MR. COLLINS: Okay. He answered yes. I'll
[8]move on.
[9]Q My next question is does that show that
[10]your client's, Mr. -- let me -- does that show that the
[11]McNulty southern boundary lies in and through Salt Lake
[12]Road?
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[14]Instruct the witness not to answer.
[15]MR. COLLINS: That's still not a reason to
[16]do that. I'm going to be asking for sanctions all over
[17]the place. This is ridiculous.
[18]Q Does Holley & Associates agree with you
[19]that the McNulty property line is south of Salt Lake
[20]Road?
[21]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
  129
[1]I instruct the witness not to answer.
[2]Q Is there any doc -- any -- any other
[3]surveyor that you've seen that agrees with you that
[4]there is one-tenth of an acre south of the actual
[5]Mason-Dixon line that is owned by the McNultys?
[6]MR. CHANG: Objection. Form.
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q Who?
[9]A The original Highland survey. The original
[10]Shaw surveys. The Dudley Campbell survey, I believe.
[11]And the Bay State survey.
[12]Q So let's go through those again. Which
[13]one, the -- the Duncan [sic]? Highland. What else?
[14]Bay State?
[15]A Original.
[16]Q Any others?
[17]A The Shaw older surveys.
[18]Q Okay. Now, Duncan, does that --
[19]A It's Dudley.
[20]Q Dudley. Excuse me. Dudley. Does that
[21]address the Casero property lines or the McNulty
  130
[1]property lines?
[2]A It was just a partial survey on the west.
[3]Q Somebody else's property lines?
[4]A No. It was a common line between Casero
[5]and Archer.
[6]Q Okay. And that places what? That puts --
[7]puts the -- that also includes the McNulty line?
[8]A It agrees with the -- it agrees with the
[9]line that I have reestablished that has been acquiesced
[10]to, which in all the legal seminars I have gone to,
[11]most cases end up that you cannot redistribute the
[12]property boundary just because now there is a newer
[13]more accurate survey.
[14]So all these other people -- first -- the
[15]first two Highland and Shaw changed their mind, but, in
[16]essence, it did not say "mistake" on that letter. It
[17]just didn't say the word "error" or "mistake" that I
[18]saw. They just adjusted to this new line between two
[19]monuments. But in my opinion, there is no
[20]contradiction that there has been an acquiesced to line
[21]from 1934 survey documented in court records, and
  131
[1]that's what I reestablished.
[2]Q Okay. What I'm asking, though, is does
[3]it -- does it establish -- does it include in that
[4]Dudley survey the -- the actual McNulty line?
[5]A It includes what I believe to be the common
[6]line between McNulty and Casero.
[7]Q You've already testified that there could
[8]be a gap between the two, right?
[9]A Minimal, yes.
[10]Q Okay. So it doesn't include reference to
[11]the McNulty deed, does it?
[12]A No.
[13]Q Okay. So the Highland survey, does that
[14]include reference to the McNulty deed?
[15]A No.
[16]Q Okay. Does the Bay State survey include
[17]reference to the McNulty deed?
[18]A No.
[19]Q The Shaw survey clearly does refer to the
[20]McNulty deed, correct?
[21]A Yes.
  132
[1]Q Okay. So that's the only one that actually
[2]references the McNulty deed. The others all refer to
[3]the Casero deeds, correct?
[4]A Or Archer.
[5]Q Okay.
[6]MR. COLLINS: Let me have this marked as
[7]the next exhibit.
[8](Farcht Exhibit 11 was marked for purposes
[9]of identification.)
[10]Q Exhibit Number 11 is the McNulty deed,
[11]original deed?
[12]A It's one of the McNulty deeds.
[13]Q It's the original deed that they had for
[14]their -- first part of their property, right?
[15]A Yes. First part.
[16]Q And it says in there that the --
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry, FJ. Can I get a
[18]copy?
[19]MR. COLLINS: I thought I just gave it to
[20]you.
[21]MR. CHANG: You did?
  133
[1]MR. COLLINS: I'll give you another.
[2]Sorry. Here you go.
[3]MR. CHANG: Thank you.
[4]Q So did you look at this document in forming
[5]your opinions?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q Okay. It says that their southern border
[8]runs in and through Salt Lake Road. Did you look at
[9]that when you formed your opinions?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Okay. And how do you -- how does this
[12]language comport with your opinions?
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[14]Instruct the witness not to answer.
[15]Q But you looked at it as part of your chain
[16]back on this, right?
[17]MR. CHANG: Asked and answered. Objection.
[18]Q And you considered it, right?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q Okay.
[21]MR. COLLINS: So he's got to be able to
  134
[1]testify about that. If he considered it for his
[2]report, he has to be able to testify about this. How
[3]can you tell him not to answer that?
[4]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[5]instruction.
[6]MR. COLLINS: So you are not going to
[7]answer questions about what he looked at to prepare his
[8]report? Okay.
[9]MR. CHANG: If you have other questions
[10]that go to damages and not liability, he's happy to
[11]answer them.
[12]MR. COLLINS: Sir -- sir, you are digging
[13]your own grave on this one.
[14]Q Did you look at the Bates deed from 2007?
[15]A Yes, at some point.
[16]Q Did you consider it in forming your
[17]opinions?
[18]A Yes.
[19](Farcht Exhibit 12 was marked for purposes
[20]of identification.)
[21]Q Looking at Exhibit Number 12, it's the
  135
[1]Bates deed. Do you remember this deed?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q All right. And in that there, they refer
[4]to "point of beginning also being along the Mason-Dixon
[5]line, thence along the southernmost dedicated
[6]right-of-way line of Salt Lake Road." What does that
[7]mean? Do you know?
[8]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. It goes
[9]to liability. And I'm going to instruct the witness
[10]not to answer.
[11]MR. COLLINS: The dedicated right-of-way
[12]line affects the amount of damages here, because if the
[13]land that we are talking about is within a dedicated
[14]right-of-way, that's important. It also goes to the
[15]witness' credibility regarding whether or not this
[16]right-of-way was dedicated.
[17]Q Did you see that?
[18]A Yes, I saw that.
[19]Q Did that impact in any way your opinions in
[20]this case?
[21]A It was considered.
  136
[1]Q And so how did -- in what way was it
[2]considered, and how did it impact your opinion in any
[3]way?
[4]A First, there is no offer of acceptance that
[5]we could find. So this dedicated right-of-way is out
[6]there in limbo.
[7]Second, the township has very vague
[8]right-of-way records. Twice we queried them.
[9]Third, Harford County claims no maintenance
[10]of this road, indicating no right-of-way within Harford
[11]County.
[12]Fourth, in the majority, there are no
[13]recorded subdivision plans in this area to the south of
[14]the road.
[15]Q Okay. This says "the southernmost
[16]dedicated right-of-way line." What did you think that
[17]meant?
[18]A If you look at the plan you can see, LL185.
[19]I forget which one that was. These aren't final plans.
[20]They are not signed.
[21]MR. CHANG: What exhibit are you referring
  137
[1]to? Just for the record, he's referring to Exhibit
[2]Number 7.
[3]Q So what are you saying?
[4]A I'm saying we had copies from the
[5]courthouse with signatures that -- from the recorder's
[6]office.
[7]Q That you didn't bring with you as
[8]instructed by counsel?
[9]MR. CHANG: That's correct. He didn't
[10]bring them.
[11]A There is no recording reference on here to
[12]cross reference.
[13]Q So what? Use it anyway. Assume it to be
[14]true. For purposes of this answer, if there is a
[15]difference --
[16]A To me, it's the southern dedicated
[17]right-of-way of the northern parcels, which is still
[18]north of the road. Even though they refer to it. We
[19]routinely do PennDOT and turnpike work. I worked for
[20]the turnpike for six years. Right-of-way is very
[21]ambiguous. Unless it's accepted, it's not official.
  138
[1]There is no record of acceptance of this dedicated
[2]right-of-way. So, in my opinion, it's not valid.
[3]Q But it's referring to a line.
[4]A It can refer --
[5]Q "Along the southernmost dedicated
[6]right-of-way line." What did that mean when these
[7]people wrote that? What did they think it meant?
[8]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[9]speculation.
[10]Q What do you think it meant?
[11]A Working for the turnpike for six years,
[12]many surveyors assume right-of-way causing
[13]encroachments, the whole corridor of the turnpike. So
[14]I am very cautious to accept deed descriptions that
[15]refer to right-of-ways because they are often not
[16]researched.
[17]Q So you just discounted this and you didn't
[18]consider it?
[19]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[20]Mischaracterization.
[21]Q Go ahead. You can -- if I
  139
[1]mischaracterized --
[2]A I considered it, but I did not believe it
[3]to be verified.
[4]Q So what -- it talks about -- this is --
[5]this is a -- forget whether or not it's a -- whether or
[6]not it was or not. What did the -- what did the
[7]surveyor mean by that expression in your opinion as
[8]a --
[9]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[10]Q -- as a surveyor?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[12]Q You can answer it.
[13]A The surveyors, I believe in many cases, do
[14]not research the right-of-way adequately. So I have to
[15]take them based on my research. And, again, based on
[16]my research, whatever his intent was, I don't think he
[17]verified, or this was verified as to the right-of-way.
[18]Q So you don't know what it means? You
[19]don't -- are you going to answer that?
[20]MR. CHANG: What was the question?
[21]Q I think it was so you don't believe that,
  140
[1]right?
[2]A Please clarify the question.
[3]Q You don't believe -- you simply don't
[4]accept what this deed says?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[6]Mischaracterization. Asked and answered.
[7]A I accept the deed. I question the
[8]verification of the right-of-way reference.
[9]Q Did you locate where the original driveway
[10]was from the house before this?
[11]A No.
[12]Q Do you know whether or not that driveway
[13]had proper access to Salt Lake Road?
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[15]MR. COLLINS: No, it doesn't.
[16]MR. CHANG: I instruct the witness not to
[17]answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: You are claiming adverse
[19]possession. You've got testimony about this. You've
[20]got statements in your answers to interrogatories about
[21]this. And you are instructing the witness not to
  141
[1]answer?
[2]MR. CHANG: Well, you just -- you just
[3]conceded that you are asking about liability.
[4]Liability has already been decided.
[5]MR. COLLINS: No.
[6]MR. CHANG: You moved to reconsideration.
[7]It was denied. You moved to strike the orders. It was
[8]denied. I don't know why we are talking about
[9]liability.
[10]MR. COLLINS: We are not. You put it in
[11]your answers to interrogatories, which you specifically
[12]said only related to damages.
[13]Q Do you know whether prior owners before the
[14]Caseros, the people that used to live there before the
[15]house burned down, whether they had proper access to
[16]Salt Lake Road?
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm objecting. Same objection.
[18]Same instruction.
[19]MR. COLLINS: Goes to whether there is a
[20]prescriptive easement or not.
[21]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
  142
[1]instruction.
[2]MR. COLLINS: Okay. If you refuse to
[3]answer that, then you can't talk about prescriptive
[4]easements and whether or not you are opposed to it.
[5]That's your problem.
[6]Q Do you have any opinion regarding whether
[7]or not the fence that was allegedly torn down was used
[8]by the McNultys in any way?
[9]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[10]MR. COLLINS: No, it doesn't. It goes to
[11]damages.
[12]MR. CHANG: Outside the scope. This is a
[13]surveyor. He's here -- this is an expert deposition.
[14]MR. COLLINS: All he has to say is he has
[15]no opinion.
[16]MR. CHANG: You know, goes to liability
[17]also. I'm instructing the witness not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: You are suing my client for
[19]having torn down a fence, and I'm asking does he know
[20]whether or not they used the fence for anything. If he
[21]doesn't know, he can just say I don't know.
  143
[1]MR. CHANG: Yeah. No. I'm sticking with
[2]the objection.
[3]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[4]Q All right. Do you know whether or not --
[5]have you seen -- let me strike that.
[6]Do you know whether or not the -- keep
[7]saying the same thing. Start over again.
[8]Have you seen the deed filed by the Caseros
[9]to quiet title? The confirmatory deed?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Do you have an opinion regarding whether or
[12]not that creates a cloud on the McNultys' title?
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. Objection. Goes to
[14]liability. And -- I'm sorry. Instructing the witness
[15]not to answer. It's also outside the scope of his
[16]expertise. He's here as a surveyor.
[17]MR. COLLINS: Has to do with damages. How
[18]much of a cloud on title does it create is relevant.
[19]Q Do you have an opinion?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. If you have an
[21]opinion, I guess.
  144
[1]A I do not have an opinion.
[2]Q Okay. Do you ever deal with clouds on
[3]title in your work?
[4]A Occasionally.
[5]Q Okay. Despite that occasional expert work
[6]regarding clouds on title, do you ever try to -- let me
[7]start over again.
[8]Do you ever work in an effort to remove a
[9]cloud on title?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Have you ever done that -- have you ever
[12]taken any action in this case, or given any opinions
[13]regarding what it would take to remove the cloud on
[14]title in this case?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. Can you rephrase
[16]that?
[17]MR. COLLINS: No.
[18]MR. CHANG: Can you repeat the question,
[19]please?
[20](The reporter read back as requested.)
[21]MR. CHANG: Again, I'm going to object.
  145
[1]Q Do you have an opinion about what it would
[2]take to remove the cloud on title in this case?
[3]MR. CHANG: Yeah. I'm going to object.
[4]Attorney-client privilege. I instruct you not to
[5]answer.
[6]MR. COLLINS: There is no attorney-client
[7]privilege between the two of you.
[8]MR. CHANG: I'm instructing you not to
[9]answer the question.
[10]MR. COLLINS: You know that's true, but you
[11]are still doing it.
[12]Q Are you his client? Do you have an
[13]attorney-client relationship with Mr. Chang?
[14]MR. CHANG: I am instructing -- there is an
[15]attorney-client privilege in place. That's our
[16]position. If you want to argue otherwise, then you can
[17]argue otherwise, but don't badger the witness about it.
[18]Q I just denote. Do you have an
[19]attorney-client relationship with Mr. Change?
[20]MR. CHANG: That's a legal conclusion.
[21]MR. COLLINS: Does he?
  146
[1]MR. CHANG: That's a legal conclusion.
[2]Q Have you ever hired Mr. Chang as a lawyer
[3]for you?
[4]A No.
[5]Q So he's not your lawyer, right? You are
[6]working for him, right?
[7]A Yes.
[8]MR. COLLINS: You are going to withdraw
[9]your objection?
[10]MR. CHANG: Nope.
[11]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[12]Q Have you done any work of any kind to try
[13]to determine whether the fence in question in this case
[14]pertained to the Caseros' land or the McNultys' land?
[15]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. Goes to
[16]liability.
[17]MR. COLLINS: Are you going to instruct him
[18]not to answer?
[19]MR. CHANG: That's right.
[20]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[21]Q Have you done any -- have you -- let me
  147
[1]just put it right out there. I've looked at aerial
[2]photographs that clearly show that the fence in
[3]question was part of an enclosure for the Casero
[4]property's predecessors in title. Clearly demonstrates
[5]this. Do you have any evidence to contradict that?
[6]A Not offhand.
[7]Q Did you find any remnants of a -- of a
[8]fence on the north side of Salt Lake Road that hooked
[9]up with the fence on the south side of north -- of Salt
[10]Lake Road?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Yeah, I'm going to
[12]object. Goes to liability. Instruct you not to
[13]answer. Witness is not a fact witness.
[14]MR. COLLINS: He's been out to the
[15]property. And he's done all sorts of surveying. He's
[16]found all sorts of different things, including iron
[17]bars and caps and railroad spikes and -- and cotton gin
[18]spikes and all sorts of different things. And I'm
[19]asking him did he see any remnants of any fence that
[20]would indicate that the fence in question was connected
[21]to a fence on the north side of the road, and you are
  148
[1]telling him not to answer that?
[2]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[3]instruction.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[5](Farcht Exhibit 13 was marked for purposes
[6]of identification.)
[7]Q This is a photograph of Caseros' front
[8]property near their --
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q -- near their driveway, right?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q Do you see the brown part?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q Does that correspond to your surveyed
[15]Mason-Dixon line or not?
[16]A I don't know.
[17]Q How would anybody know?
[18]A They would have to locate the edge of that
[19]brown spot and compare it to the line.
[20]Q Do you have any reason to believe that this
[21]does correspond?
  149
[1]A I would have to locate it and compare it.
[2]Q Well, you've got your survey right there.
[3]Can you do that?
[4]A All the evidence of this survey has been
[5]field located by angle and distance. And this has not
[6]been.
[7]Q So you -- you, nor the Caseros, nor the
[8]McNultys would be able to know that, in fact, that dirt
[9]line corresponds to your surveyed Mason-Dixon line,
[10]correct?
[11]MR. CHANG: Objection. Mischaracterization
[12]of testimony.
[13]Q Is that true or not?
[14]A Repeat the question, please.
[15]MR. COLLINS: Can you repeat it?
[16](The reporter read back as requested.)
[17]A I don't know when this photo was taken. I
[18]don't know if they graded more or planted more. So
[19]compared to my field survey, I have no idea how this
[20]equates.
[21]Q Okay.
  150
[1](Farcht Exhibit 14 was marked for purposes
[2]of identification.)
[3]Q Exhibit Number 14 is a similar photograph.
[4]But it looks west instead of east, right?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q Is your answer the same as it relates to
[7]the surveyed Mason-Dixon line?
[8]A Yes.
[9]Q You cannot say whether or not that brown
[10]line corresponds directly with the -- your surveyed
[11]Mason-Dixon line, correct?
[12]A That's correct.
[13]Q What was the earliest corner marker that
[14]you found to establish the line you've been talking
[15]about as the surveyed Mason-Dixon line?
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[17]Instruct you not to answer.
[18]MR. COLLINS: It goes to how much land is
[19]being trespassed upon.
[20]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[21]instruction.
  151
[1]MR. COLLINS: It also goes to my client's
[2]good faith. It goes to his credibility. It goes to
[3]all sorts of things that are relevant to it. And it
[4]also goes to his report. It's specifically referred to
[5]in his report. And his plats. I'm just trying to find
[6]out.
[7]Q On your plat that you put as Exhibit Number
[8]2 to your report, and on your plat that you have
[9]marked -- you know, that is Exhibit A to the amended
[10]complaint, can you please tell me what was the earliest
[11]marker that you found for the corners, the east and
[12]west corners of the Shaw -- excuse me, of the McNulty
[13]and the Casero properties?
[14]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object because it
[15]goes to liability. And I'm going to instruct the
[16]client not to answer. I'm sorry. The witness.
[17]MR. COLLINS: Take a short break. Wait a
[18]minute. Hang on.
[19](A discussion was held off the record.)
[20]Q Using Exhibit A to the amended complaint,
[21]isn't it true that the amount of land that is allegedly
  152
[1]being trespassed upon is all within the bed of Salt
[2]Lake Road?
[3]A No.
[4]Q How much is not?
[5]A If you look at Exhibit 2 of Exhibit 1,
[6]typically the roadway is the traveled cartway. There
[7]is an area on the north end that's white, not in the
[8]hatched area.
[9](The reporter asked for clarification.)
[10]THE WITNESS: Not in the hatched area.
[11]Sorry.
[12]A Pointing to here.
[13]Q So that's not the north, but that's on the
[14]west?
[15]A Well, it's the north of Casero.
[16]Q Okay. So what are you saying?
[17]A The grayed area was made gray to better
[18]define the traveled cartway, which is generally the
[19]travel area of the road. So from there down it's
[20]outside of the traveled cartway.
[21]Q All right. So let me just have it for a
  153
[1]second. So I think -- I'll restate what you just said
[2]and make sure I have it understood. The way I'm
[3]interpreting your Exhibit Number 2 is that the grayed
[4]area is the cartway --
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q -- or the road, Salt Lake Road, right?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q And that goes to the edge of the asphalt,
[9]correct?
[10]A Within.
[11]Q Couple of inches?
[12]A Correct.
[13]Q And so most of the disputed property is
[14]within the -- within the bed of Salt Lake Road,
[15]correct? A vast majority?
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. Characterization.
[17]You can answer.
[18]A Well, looking at it, it appears a quarter
[19]of it graphically is not.
[20]Q Okay. I said the vast majority.
[21]A Okay.
  154
[1]Q 75 percent of the land you call area of
[2]dispute is in the bed of Salt Lake Road? In the
[3]asphalt, correct?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q And about 25 percent is south of Salt Lake
[6]Road, correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q So if we take 25 percent, then we are
[9]talking about -- about 1,000 square feet? Something
[10]like that? Maybe 1,200 -- 1,100 square feet?
[11]A 1,150.
[12]Q 1,150 square feet. How many acres is that?
[13]A It would be the same. It would be a
[14]quarter of a tenth of an acre. .2 -- 0. -- .025 acres.
[15]Q .025 acres is not in the bed of Salt Lake
[16]Road?
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry. Mr. Collins, can
[18]you sit down and not loom over my client, or the --
[19]MR. COLLINS: I'm just trying to see the
[20]documents. They are hard to see.
[21]MR. CHANG: It's right in front of you.
  155
[1]MR. COLLINS: I'm happy to sit down. Do I
[2]intimidate you or something? I'm sorry if I did. I
[3]didn't mean to.
[4]MR. CHANG: The posture, yes.
[5]MR. COLLINS: I think you are playing
[6]games, but okay.
[7]Q What I'm asking is -- so we are talking
[8]about .25 -- .025 of an acre, or about 1,200 square
[9]feet, or 1,100 square feet is not in the bed of Salt
[10]Lake Road, right?
[11]A Approximately.
[12]Q Okay. But you haven't actually done the
[13]math on that, have you?
[14]A No.
[15]Q You haven't actually measured the part
[16]that's not in the asphalt, right?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q And as far as you know, does York County or
[19]Harford County have the right to put asphalt on the
[20]entire amount, including the part that is not currently
[21]asphalted?
  156
[1]MR. CHANG: Objection. It's outside the
[2]scope.
[3]Q You can answer.
[4]A Based on experience with PennDOT and the
[5]turnpike, if the right-of-way is only a cartway in this
[6]area, they would have to buy easement to extend the
[7]widening of the pavement.
[8]Q What if it's thirty -- 33 feet --
[9]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[10]speculation.
[11]Q -- wide?
[12]MR. COLLINS: No, it doesn't.
[13]Q Go ahead. You can answer.
[14]A If it's 33, they still may need a temporary
[15]construction easement.
[16]Q Anything else?
[17]A I don't think so.
[18]MR. COLLINS: Take a short break. I think
[19]we are almost done.
[20](A recess was taken.)
[21]Q Are you comfortable with the fact that
  157
[1]based upon your report, the court has decided to move
[2]the Maryland -- the Mason-Dixon line?
[3]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[4]Mischaracterization. The court didn't move the
[5]Mason-Dixon line. I'm going to -- objection.
[6]Mischaracterization of the court's order. It speaks
[7]for itself.
[8]Q You can answer.
[9]A I see this as two lines again. There is an
[10]acquiesced to line, which I believe the court agreed
[11]to, and there is a monumented line that everybody has
[12]now suddenly tied to after years of not doing so.
[13]Q Okay. Just to be clear which ones you are
[14]talking about, the acquiesced line is the one further
[15]south, and the monumented line is the one that you
[16]called the actual Mason-Dixon line, right?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q Okay. All right. So here's one last --
[19]well, hopefully last, but we'll see.
[20]The -- was the McNulty southern boundary
[21]clearly marked on both ends before you got involved?
  158
[1]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. It goes
[2]to liability. Instruct you not to answer.
[3]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't just go to
[4]liability. It also goes to their intent.
[5]MR. CHANG: Same instruction. Same
[6]objection.
[7]Q Was the southeast boundary of the McNulty
[8]property ever marked?
[9]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[10]Instruct the witness not to answer.
[11]MR. COLLINS: You -- just to be clear here,
[12]you have alleged in the complaint and asked for damages
[13]based upon the fact that the southern boundary of the
[14]McNulty property was clearly marked. I need to know
[15]whether it was clearly marked or not because that goes
[16]to my client's liability for damages.
[17]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[18]instruction.
[19]MR. COLLINS: You are telling him not to
[20]answer whether or not the boundary was clearly marked?
[21]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
  159
[1]instruction. I believe your question goes to
[2]liability.
[3]MR. COLLINS: It doesn't. It goes to
[4]damages.
[5]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[6]instruction.
[7]MR. COLLINS: It can go to both at the same
[8]time, by the way. Just to be really clear, all of
[9]these things can go to both issues. There is not that
[10]clear of a delineation here. You are still going to
[11]stand by that?
[12]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[13]instruction.
[14]Q In your -- in your Exhibit A to the amended
[15]complaint, you have referenced on the southeast corner
[16]what markings?
[17]A We reference the Holley rebar, rebar and
[18]cap that we set, which is based on the recovered corner
[19]marker and the point that was online by the previous
[20]survey. And by that distance we were able to
[21]reestablish the southeast corner.
  160
[1]Q So re-- make -- make that clear what you
[2]meant by that. There is -- there is a marker set by
[3]Holley & Associates, correct?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q Where is that? In the bed of Salt Lake
[6]Road?
[7]MR. CHANG: Again, I'm going to object.
[8]This goes to liability.
[9]MR. COLLINS: It's on his report.
[10]MR. CHANG: Liability. Instruct you not to
[11]answer.
[12]MR. COLLINS: It's on his document. You
[13]can't do that.
[14]MR. CHANG: If you are asking about -- if
[15]you mean it's on a document the fact that you are
[16]asking about in the context of liability makes it
[17]proper because there is a protective order with respect
[18]to the limit of liability -- limit of discovery, which
[19]is limited to damages and relief.
[20]This question goes to liability. I'm
[21]instructing the witness for that reason not to answer.
  161
[1]And I'm objecting -- objecting because it goes outside
[2]the bounds and the scope of permissible discovery as
[3]ordered by the court.
[4]MR. COLLINS: Just for the record, every
[5]time I said it goes to damages, I wanted to make it
[6]clear, I was referring to damages being also other
[7]forms of relief that you've requested. I apologize if
[8]I only used -- if I used a more narrow term. What I
[9]really meant all throughout this deposition, when I
[10]refer to damages, I meant damages and other forms of
[11]relief. Okay. Does that change your position on any
[12]of these answers?
[13]MR. CHANG: Going back to the beginning
[14]three hours ago?
[15]MR. COLLINS: Yeah.
[16]MR. CHANG: I have no idea. I have to read
[17]the transcript.
[18]MR. COLLINS: Well, you -- you know as a
[19]lawyer that this case involves other relief as well.
[20]So I believe all of my questions included other relief.
[21]And your refusal to allow him to answer questions has
  162
[1]interfered with my ability to get any information from
[2]this witness that relates to damages and other relief.
[3]I'm going to continue with this question right now.
[4]Q As it relates to your report that you
[5]provided in Exhibits 2 and 3 to your report, and in
[6]Exhibit A to the amended complaint, it mentions a rebar
[7]to be set. What does that refer to?
[8]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[9]instruction.
[10]Q Did you set it?
[11]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[12]instruction.
[13]Q Does that mean that the rebar to be set had
[14]not yet been set by that date?
[15]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[16]instruction.
[17]Q Is there anything that you know of that
[18]would have put Mr. Casero on notice of a clearly marked
[19]southern boundary of the McNulty property?
[20]MR. CHANG: Same objection. Same
[21]instruction.
  163
[1]MR. COLLINS: No further questions.
[2]MR. CHANG: Also calls for speculation.
