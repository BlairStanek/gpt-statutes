[1]right?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. Have you reviewed his records?
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. And based on the records and examination, are you prepared
[6]to talk about his conditions?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. Okay. So let me talk to you a little bit about your
[9]background and training. I have your CV, which is
[10]Exhibit 2075. And I note -- well, let me get my copy. I note
[11]that you have been licensed as a physician for 50 years, right?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. And are you at the point that you are ready to retire?
[14]A. I'm retired from clinical practice as of May 1 of this
[15]year.
[16]Q. And are you continuing, though, to do research?
[17]A. Yes, I'm continuing to see research patients and see a
[18]clinic that I run by telemedicine.
[19]Q. And have you -- as a neuro -- you are a neuropediatric
[20]neurologist?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. What's a pediatric neurologist, because you don't look like
[23]you are a kid?
[24]A. I guess it depends how you act. A pediatric neurologist [*5]  is
[25]a pediatrician who has had special training in neurology, like
Pg. 607
[1]a pediatrician who has had training in cardiology. It is just
[2]in the field of neurology.
[3]Q. Okay. And if I can, just a little bit about your CV.
[4]Where do you live, by the way?
[5]A. I live in Mission Viejo, California.
[6]Q. And same state that Stevie lives in, California.
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. And you were born, I noticed, on tax day, right?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. What a wonderful day to have a birthday.
[11]THE COURT: That happens to also be my birthday.
[12]THE WITNESS: I arranged it that way.
[13]THE COURT: Thanks for the comment.
[14]MR. WILLIAMS: It is a great day.
[15]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Okay. You have been -- you went to --
[16]you got your medical training where?
[17]A. Ohio State University College of Medicine.
[18]Q. Are you board-certified in areas of specialty?
[19]A. Yes, I'm board-certified in pediatrics and neurology, with
[20]special competence in child neurology.
[21]Q. Okay. And you have been postdoctoral training.
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. In research fellowships.
[24]A. Yes. [*6] 
[25]Q. And you've had -- do you teach? Have you taught during
Pg. 608
[1]your career?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. Tell us about that.
[4]A. So I -- at the University of California, Irvine, I was
[5]division chief in pediatric neurology for about 30 years, chair
[6]of pediatrics for 10 years, and associate dean for clinical
[7]neuroscience for 7 years.
[8]Q. Okay. Do you enjoy teaching?
[9]A. Yes, very much.
[10]Q. Are you a research scientist too?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. And you were sharing with me you just -- tell the jury, you
[13]just got a pretty big grant for the government to research some
[14]things, didn't you?
[15]A. So my research is regarding Down's syndrome and its
[16]relationship to Alzheimer's disease, so we got a grant to look
[17]at predictors of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down's
[18]syndrome.
[19]Q. And you want to -- you have been in that grant for how many
[20]years?
[21]A. Well, the current grant, this is the second year. It is a
[22]five-year grant.
[23]Q. Okay. And you intend to see it through?
[24]A. It is my objective.
[25]Q. Okay. You have written articles, scholarly articles, [*7]  sir?
Pg. 609
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And I'm not going to go into your awards and honors
[3]necessarily, except that you have received some awards for your
[4]research with regards to Down's syndrome, right?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. And what's the spotlight award for new --
[7]A. It's an award given to someone in the state of California
[8]who has contributed to people with developmental disabilities.
[9]Q. Okay. And I think we talked -- you were the chairman of
[10]the department of pediatrics and associate dean for clinical
[11]neurosciences, right?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. Listed Best Doctors in America for the last 30-plus years.
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Okay. And you have been asked to review articles for
[16]prestigious journals?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Including The Lancet, which has come up in this case.
[19]They've asked you to review and be a peer reviewer?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. And one of the other of the many things you have been asked
[22]to consult on is the New England Journal of Medicine, correct?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. Okay. I think I've trapped you here. You have the New
[25]England Journal of Medicine listed [*8]  twice?
Pg. 610
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. Are you trying to pad your resumé, sir?
[3]A. No, I just didn't read it carefully.
[4]Q. Okay. We will let you off.
[5]And on scholarly articles that have been published, over
[6]100, right?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. So let's go back to Stevie for a moment.
[9]By the way, we've asked you to do this, and we're paying
[10]you, we're compensating you for your time in doing this, right?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. And how much is that rate, sir?
[13]A. $ 500 an hour.
[14]Q. And how much has it been so far that -- the time you've
[15]spent, how much have you billed so far?
[16]A. I guess independent of this testimony, 20 hours, 24 hours.
[17]I'd have to go back and look.
[18]Q. Okay.
[19]I had $ 14,006, which would be 28 hours but -- if you --
[20]does that sound right?
[21]A. Well, if I billed it, it was correct because I keep careful
[22]track of the hours.
[23]Q. Gotcha. Okay. Did you prepare an expert report in this
[24]case?
[25]A. Yes.
Pg. 611
[1]Q. And how does one go about preparing an expert report? Did
[2]you look at Stevie's medical records? [*9] 
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And do you have the medical records there?
[5]Let me show you --
[6]MR. WILLIAMS: May I approach -- do I need to ask you?
[7]THE COURT: You do not. Yes.
[8]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Exhibit 2470, are those the medical
[9]records that you have reviewed with regard to Stevie?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. In addition to that, did you meet with Stevie in person?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. Along with his mom?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Did you examine him?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. Where did this examination take place?
[18]A. It was in Sacramento, at one of the airport hotels.
[19]Q. How much time did you spend examining Stevie?
[20]A. The history and the examination took about an hour and a
[21]half altogether.
[22]Q. Okay. And have you had an opportunity to review the
[23]day-in-the-life video that we had taken of what it looks --
[24]events in Stevie's life?
[25]A. Yes.
Pg. 612
[1]Q. Is this the normal process one would go by to try and
[2]evaluate somebody in Stevie's condition?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And do you have -- in your experience, have you dealt with
[5]children with [*10]  spina bifida over your career?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Would you elaborate, please.
[8]A. I'm a general pediatric neurologist when it comes to
[9]private practice or university practice. So when I was in
[10]full-time practice, I would have about 20, 25 patients with
[11]spina bifida. Since I became emeritus in 2012, it's half of
[12]that or less.
[13]Q. And your examination, I believe, of Stevie was
[14]November 29th of 2015, is that --
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. Okay. And have we asked you to coordinate with a Valeri
[17]Parisi, who will come and testify next week, who is a life care
[18]planner?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Why do you coordinate with the life care planner?
[21]A. Well, for one thing, I'm asked to do it. I guess the
[22]method here is to try to figure out what the child needs going
[23]forward, what kind of services, interventions.
[24]Q. Is it -- Ms. Parisi, I will tell you, does not have a
[25]medical license, so she needs a physician's input, right?
Pg. 613
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And you are -- and as far as going out and finding the --
[3]you recommend the services; is that right?
[4]A. Yes. We talk about what [*11]  services a patient would need and
[5]equipment and that type of thing.
[6]Q. And like most doctors, you don't know what any of that
[7]costs, do you?
[8]A. I do not.
[9]Q. Okay. That's Ms. Parisi's job, is to put a cost with the
[10]services, right?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. Okay. Now, the life care plan that you and Mrs. Parisi
[13]have coordinated on, do you think it is a reasonable life care
[14]plan?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. And do you think the things that have been put in there
[17]that you have recommended and she's priced are necessary for
[18]Stevie's care?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Do you -- Dr. Lott, the opinions you are going to give
[21]about Stevie today, are they based on reasonable medical
[22]probability?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. Okay. Now, going back to the medical records, this isn't
[25]all of his medical records, these are the selected ones that
Pg. 614
[1]are of some significance, correct?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. And have you and I looked at some other -- where are my
[4]overlays? Here they are.
[5]Well, let's first talk about Stevie's injuries.
[6](Conferring)
[7]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Okay. [*12]  So let's try to list for the
[8]jury what Stevie's injuries are and then talk about them
[9]independently, okay, sir?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. Spina bifida -- Dr. Oakley has spoken about spina bifida,
[12]but that's something that -- you treat children with spina
[13]bifida, right?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And we'll go back to that. Hydrocephalus -- can you
[16]explain to us what hydrocephalus is?
[17]A. So the brain floats in fluid inside the skull. One of the
[18]advantages evolutionary of that is if you put a grapefruit in a
[19]bucket and you kick the bucket, the grapefruit bounces back and
[20]forth. But if you put the grapefruit in water and you kick the
[21]bucket, the movement is buffered. So the brain is surrounded
[22]with this fluid, and the fluid flows around the outside of the
[23]brain, through the inside of the brain, and then out through
[24]the brain stem.
[25]Q. So what is hydrocephalus?
Pg. 615
[1]A. So hydrocephalus means that the flow of spinal fluid is
[2]blocked, and it starts to back up. And when it starts to back
[3]up, it can press on the brain and have some fairly dire
[4]consequences. So hydrocephalus is something that [*13]  has to be
[5]diagnosed and treated.
[6]Q. And does Stevie have hydrocephalus?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. Now, a Chiari brain malformation, is that sometimes
[9]referred to as an Arnold-Chiari brain malformation?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. I want to see if you know this. Who was Arnold and who was
[12]Chiari?
[13]A. Well, one, I believe, was German, but I don't have any -- I
[14]don't remember as I sit here.
[15]Q. Okay. I think Chiari was an Italian pathologist and
[16]Arnold, I think, is right, was a German. But anyway, they put
[17]their names, and sometimes it's referred to as "Chiari" and
[18]sometimes Arnold-Chiari brain malformation.
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. It's named after the doctors that first identified it,
[21]right?
[22]A. Right.
[23]Q. But -- and are there more than one -- is there more than
[24]one type of Arnold-Chiari brain malformation?
[25]A. Yes. There are four types, but the most is Arnold-Chiari I
Pg. 616
[1]or Arnold-Chiari II.
[2]Q. Which one does he have?
[3]A. He has Arnold-Chiari II.
[4]Q. And if you can explain for us a little bit what
[5]Arnold-Chiari II brain malformation is.
[6] [*14]  A. In Arnold-Chiari, the back part of the brain, the
[7]cerebellum, is pushed down through the opening in the spinal
[8]column, and the degree to which it is pushed down determines
[9]whether its an Arnold-Chiari I or an Arnold-Chiari II.
[10]Patients who are born with spina bifida or myelomeningocele
[11]will invariably have Arnold-Chiari Type II, which is what
[12]Stevie has. So that means the cerebellar tonsils are pushed
[13]down into the upper part of the spine.
[14]Q. We will go over that in a little more detail a little
[15]later.
[16]You have listed neurogenic bowel and bladder. Would you
[17]tell us what that means?
[18]A. So when you have myelomeningocele, or spina bifida, because
[19]the spine didn't close completely, you have got a mass of
[20]nerves down there like spaghetti. Instead of being neat and
[21]orderly, they're just chopped and jammed together. As a result
[22]of that, you do not have innervation or the nerves don't work
[23]for the bowel and bladder. So almost all the time you have got
[24]incontinence of stool, leakage of stool, and incontinence of
[25]urine. And those are big problems with spina bifida.
Pg. 617
[1]Q. Okay. And [*15]  clubbed feet?
[2]A. Clubbed feet are feet that are positioned internally and
[3]they're -- it probably comes about because the baby inside the
[4]womb didn't have a lot of movement. One reason you might not
[5]have a lot of movement is you don't have the nerves to move the
[6]feet. And so more often than not, babies with spina bifida are
[7]born with clubbed feet.
[8]Q. Tethered spinal cord, what does that mean?
[9]A. That means the spinal cord is abnormally attached at the
[10]base. So as the spine begins to grow, the cord starts to get
[11]stretched, and it can make a neurological deficit worse.
[12]So, for example, in spina bifida, if you have got partial
[13]movement of the legs and you have got a tethered cord -- you
[14]may end up with no movements of the legs. So it is one of the
[15]findings in spina bifida that has to be approached.
[16]Q. The PFO -- patent foramen -- I can't pronounce it -- ovale.
[17]Would you tell us --
[18]A. Yes. That's a congenital malformation between the chambers
[19]of the heart, and it's not one of the more serious ones, but it
[20]has to be considered and was in Stevie. His patent foramen
[21]ovale also [*16]  has some kind of attachment to the mitral valve, so
[22]it is a little bit complex, but, I mean, he is doing fine with
[23]it.
[24]Q. And okay. Polydactyly?
[25]A. Polydactyly is an extra digit; in Stevie's case, an extra
Pg. 618
[1]thumb.
[2]Q. We are going to talk about some of these in more detail,
[3]and I put spina bifida up there, but I want to talk about
[4]paralysis. Does Stevie have some paralysis?
[5]A. He has weakness, yes.
[6]Q. Okay. And explain that.
[7]A. Paralysis means you can't move at all. Stevie does have
[8]movement, although it's limited, and it's not strong enough to
[9]support normal walking and that type of thing.
[10]Q. And that's as a result of the open spinal cord.
[11]A. That's the result of this knot of nerves that occur in
[12]spina bifida or myelomeningocele.
[13]Q. Okay. I'd like to talk next about Stevie's surgeries, if
[14]we could. And have you put together a list of his surgeries
[15]and the date?
[16]A. Yes, you want me -- I'm sorry. What was the question?
[17]Q. Have you put together a list of his surgeries and the dates
[18]of the surgeries?
[19]A. Oh, yes.
[20] [*17]  Q. Okay. So when he was first born, was there a surgery --
[21]the neural tube closure to close the exposed spinal cord in his
[22]back?
[23]A. Yes. That becomes an urgent matter because if you leave
[24]that open too long, it gets infected, and the infection goes up
[25]the spinal cord to the brain. So I believe it was the day
Pg. 619
[1]after birth.
[2]Q. And the second surgery, on February 9, '07, is a shunt
[3]placement. Why would Stevie need a shunt placement?
[4]A. Because patients with myelomeningocele and Arnold-Chiari
[5]Type II invariably have hydrocephalus, and it have to be
[6]shunted pretty quickly.
[7]Q. I'm going to ask you to translate that into English.
[8]A. Oh, dear, I thought I was. Okay. The patients with
[9]myelomeningocele have hydrocephalus, which is a block in the
[10]spinal fluid. The spinal fluid gets through the brain, and it
[11]gets hung up down in the lower part of the neck. So a shunt
[12]has to be put in there to the pressure so it doesn't keep
[13]pressing on the brain. And these days, the shunt goes from the
[14]water cavity called the ventricle down into the lining of the
[15]peritoneum, which is over the [*18]  abdominal cavity, and so the
[16]spinal fluid goes from the brain down into the peritoneal
[17]cavity, and that's called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
[18]Q. Is that a drain from -- a brain drain that goes down into
[19]the stomach?
[20]A. Yes. It is a drain that goes through the brain to the
[21]water cavity of the brain called the ventricle, and then it
[22]comes out and goes under the skin, down to the peritoneal
[23]region.
[24]Q. And he had that placed February 9th of '07.
[25]A. Yes.
Pg. 620
[1]Q. Now, tenotomies, on July 2nd, '07, what is that?
[2]A. Tenotomies are operations to relieve contractures. One of
[3]the problems in myelomeningocele is that you get contractures
[4]at the level of the hip, the level of the knee, the level of
[5]the heel, and so tenotomies relieve those contractures, those
[6]scars that impair movement.
[7]Q. Stevie's tendons were where, that they had to surgically
[8]relieve these?
[9]A. I'd have to look back at the record. I believe they were
[10]below the hip, and certainly in the next were down in the
[11]heels.
[12]Q. So the next surgery, November 16th of '07, Achilles
[13]release, [*19]  and they did polydactyl repair. So let's take the
[14]November '07 surgery first, the Achilles release.
[15]A. So the Achilles tendon --
[16]Q. Doctor, let me interrupt, I apologize.
[17]You don't do these surgeries yourself, but you are familiar
[18]with how they're done, right?
[19]A. No. These surgeries are done by an orthopedic surgeon,
[20]generally a pediatric or orthopedic surgeon.
[21]Q. And when you see the need for this, you bring in a
[22]pediatric orthopedic surgeon to do these types of things,
[23]right?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Okay. So, if you would, if you would explain it --
Pg. 621
[1]A. So now we are trying to make the heel a little more fluid
[2]in the movement, so they did a release of the Achilles tendon,
[3]which is at the base of the foot.
[4]Q. And the polydactyly repair, what is that?
[5]A. He had an extra thumb as part of his birth defect, and it's
[6]classified on the basis of how much is duplicated. So his
[7]thumb was duplicated down to about the midpoint, and so he had
[8]a hand surgeon relieve that problem, that polydactyly problem.
[9]Q. Okay. They actually removed his extra digit, [*20]  his extra
[10]thumb.
[11]A. Yeah. It was more complicated than that, but that included
[12]removing it, yes.
[13]Q. Okay. And then on July 15, 2011, clubbed feet repair, if
[14]you will give us a little bit about that.
[15]A. So as previously mentioned, the club feet, the feet are
[16]turned inward, and they don't provide a basis for any type of
[17]movement. So one way to treat it is to put them in a splint,
[18]put the legs in a splint, and, in this case, it was called the
[19]Craig splint. But he actually did require surgery to try to
[20]straighten those feet out.
[21]Q. And he's worn splints since birth essentially?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. And has them now?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. And in spite of having the splints, they had to go in and
Pg. 622
[1]try and surgically help him out?
[2]A. Yeah. The splints help, but not enough.
[3]Q. Okay. So let's fast-forward to May 14, 2012. The Malone
[4]antegrade continence enema procedure. Is that sometimes
[5]referred to as the MACE procedure?
[6]A. Yes. You just take the MACE from the name, and it's
[7]called MACE.
[8]Q. And that was for what purpose? We will get into it [*21]  in more
[9]detail, but just tell me for what purpose.
[10]A. Well, that's to help him have normal bowel movements, and
[11]it's to prevent leakage of feces into the diaper. And it's a
[12]procedure that gives the patient some control over the movement
[13]of the bowels.
[14]Q. And the seventh procedure -- October 5, 2012 -- a tethered
[15]cord release. Can you tell us what that is?
[16]A. The tethered cord is a cord that is abnormally fastened at
[17]the base of the spine, and the neurosurgeons taking care of
[18]Stevie felt that that was impairing his function, so they
[19]released the scar down there that was tethering the spinal
[20]cord.
[21]Q. Okay. So now let me -- the eighth surgery, on January 24th
[22]of '13, the clubbed feet repair. Now, it looks like about a
[23]year and a half or two years earlier, on July 15th of '11, they
[24]did a clubbed feet repair, but they came back and did another
[25]one. Can you explain that?
Pg. 623
[1]A. Yes, they did another one. It was kind of a second stage.
[2]The first stage had worked but not completely, so they went
[3]back in to try to relax those feet.
[4]Q. Okay. November 8th of 2013, a bowel [*22]  tube placement. What
[5]would that be, sir?
[6]A. So in the MACE, there is an opening to the skin. And
[7]sometimes that opening gets too small for the catheter to go
[8]in. And it's called a stenosis when it is too small. So they
[9]have to go in and put another bowel tube in.
[10]Q. Is that a complication of the Malone antegrade continence
[11]enema procedure?
[12]A. Well, it's one of the side effects, yes, that can happen.
[13]Q. And then on November 11th of 2013, they did a MACE
[14]revision. And what was that?
[15]A. I think that was all part -- I think 9 and 10 were done at
[16]about the same time. They had to work on that stoma, that
[17]opening, because it was closing off.
[18]Q. And December 11th of 2015, bladder injections. What is
[19]that?
[20]A. So one of the things that happens with myelomeningocele, or
[21]spina bifida, is the bladder doesn't have normal motility, so
[22]we are trying to get the bladder to relax so that his
[23]catheterizations can work better. So one way to do that is to
[24]inject a muscle relaxant into the bladder. It is simply Botox
[25]to relax the muscles of the bladder.
Pg. 624
[1]Q. I want [*23]  to talk to you a little bit about the -- you
[2]mentioned, brought up the subject of catheterization. Explain
[3]catheterization into the bladder, please.
[4]A. I guess the technical term for that is clean, intermittent
[5]catheterization. So because of the lack of urinary control,
[6]the bladder has to be emptied, and that's emptied by putting a
[7]tube through the opening in the penis up into the bladder, and
[8]that has to be done a couple of times a day to try to get the
[9]bladder water or the urine out. You don't want the urine
[10]sitting there for long periods of time. And that's a procedure
[11]that Stevie does himself now.
[12]Q. Is that a procedure -- Stevie can do it, right? He can
[13]self-cath?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Is that enough? -- to be able to just do that procedure?
[16]A. Well, here's how I look at it. To do it is good. But it's
[17]really got to be perfect because if you are going to be
[18]sticking a catheter into the bladder, you do not want any
[19]bacteria getting up there. Because if bacteria get up there,
[20]they can go up to the kidneys. He can't feel things very well
[21]there, and then they can get into the bloodstream, [*24]  and that can
[22]be a disaster. It's called Gram-negative sepsis, and it comes
[23]from problems in the urethra and the bladder and the kidney,
[24]and then getting -- so the catheterization has to be done
[25]really perfectly or very close to perfectly. So I noticed in
Pg. 625
[1]the day of the life that mom needs to guide Stevie in doing
[2]this. But he does a good job, I would say.
[3]Q. Perfection is important why?
[4]A. I think if your technique is not pretty close to perfect,
[5]you run this risk of inducing infection. And he's had a number
[6]of urine tract infections.
[7]Q. Okay. Now, going -- December 16th of 2006, tethered cord
[8]release. I thought he had a tethered cord release, No. 7 up
[9]there, on October 5th of 2012.
[10]A. Well, like some of the other procedures, he needed a second
[11]stage. He needed another one.
[12]Q. Okay. And as a pediatrician, do these things change as
[13]people grow?
[14]A. Well, the whole anatomy changes down there because the
[15]spine is getting bigger, and there are other changes going on.
[16]So, yes, it's a moving target that way.
[17]Q. So let's go back and -- have you helped me [*25]  put together
[18]some videos and some overlays to show more about these
[19]conditions?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. Okay. Let's start with the spina bifida again. I think
[22]the jury has seen this several times. This is a child in the
[23]womb with the myelomeningocele protruding from the back, right?
[24]A. Yes. It's called a myelomeningocele when the nerves are
[25]actually protruding into the sack.
Pg. 626
[1]Q. Okay. And we've got a video about that.
[2]MR. WILLIAMS: So if we can play that now, Ron.
[3](Exhibit No. 2469 played to the jury.)
[4]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Okay. So if you can walk us through
[5]this and explain it to us, Doctor.
[6]A. So this is just showing that the first stage occurs very
[7]early in the pregnancy, and it's a failure of the spinal cord
[8]to close, so you've got the nerves exposed to the elements.
[9]And myelomeningocele is when you actually have the nerves
[10]coming out through the skin.
[11]Q. And this is the -- what did you -- how did you describe it,
[12]spaghetti or…
[13]A. Well, yeah, this is just a cartoon of nerves coming out
[14]from the sack.
[15]Q. And why is it so important, [*26]  then, to surgically repair
[16]that?
[17]MR. WILLIAMS: Let's stop that. Stop, Ron, for just a
[18]second.
[19]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Why is it so important to surgically
[20]repair the myelomeningocele?
[21]A. Well, you have to repair it pretty quickly because the
[22]nerves are out there and they can get infected, and the
[23]infection can go up to the brain. And that's the worry about
[24]how these spina bifida problems present in a newborn.
[25]Q. And that's the surgery that was done on February 3rd of
Pg. 627
[1]'07.
[2]A. Yes. He had the enclosure, I believe, a day after birth.
[3]Q. Okay. So now we are looking up at the brain, and if you
[4]can give us a little bit of an insight as to what is going on
[5]here.
[6]A. Okay. Well, this is not my favorite picture. It is a
[7]little bit hard to understand here, but, basically, it is
[8]trying to show how the spinal fluid is moving around the brain
[9]and down into the spinal cord. So when there's a block of
[10]fluid starts to accumulate and the baby head expands -- because
[11]the bones of the baby are very soft. So if you have a blockage
[12]and the fluid accumulating and you [*27]  don't shunt it, the head can
[13]get very big.
[14]Q. Okay. Thank you.
[15]MR. WILLIAMS: Ron, is that the end of the -- I think
[16]that's the end of it. Okay.
[17]Can I have the ELMO back, please.
[18]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Let's talk a little bit more, a diagram
[19]about the Chiari brain malformation, and it's a Chiari II brain
[20]malformation. Some would say an Arnold-Chiari II brain
[21]malformation.
[22]A. So this is a cartoon, really, of the back part of the
[23]brain, which is called the cerebellum, and normally you see
[24]that the cerebellum is right there at the level of the opening.
[25]That opening is called the foramen magnum. But in
Pg. 628
[1]Arnold-Chiari, associated with myelomeningocele, the brain
[2]comes down into the spinal area. So these are what is called
[3]the tonsils of the cerebellum, and this is what happened with
[4]Stevie, that these tonsils were displaced downward.
[5]Q. Okay. So see this area here, where the brain -- is that
[6]where the -- it normally will drain -- the fluid?
[7]A. Well, they'll put the drain up in the ventricular cavities,
[8]the water cavities.
[9]Q. No. I'm talking about [*28]  where is it that this blocks? I see
[10]that it comes down.
[11]A. The block is at the outlet of what's called the fourth
[12]ventricle because everything is compressed there because of the
[13]downward traction. And so the spinal fluid really cannot get
[14]out of the holes in the fourth ventricle, which are designed to
[15]do that. And that's -- the technical term for that is a
[16]noncommunicating hydrocephalus.
[17]Q. Okay. And in order to drain the -- after this brain
[18]malformation, in order to drain the fluid, that's the VP shunt,
[19]right?
[20]A. Right. You have to shunt around it, so you put the -- this
[21]is called the proximal of the upper end of the shunt go through
[22]the brain into the water cavity, then run the tube down into
[23]the peritoneal cavity, so you are bypassing the block.
[24]Q. Okay. And we have got a video of that, if we can go to
[25]the…
Pg. 629
[1]MR. WILLIAMS: The same exhibit number as the last
[2]one.
[3](Video played)
[4]AUDIENCE MEMBER: Which one.
[5]MR. WILLIAMS: Nope, the wrong one. The hydrocephalus
[6]VP shunt.
[7]A. So you make an incision in the scalp and an incision in the
[8] [*29]  stomach. This is where the tube has to go. And then this tube
[9]is buried up in the skin up toward this head area, and then you
[10]have to drill in the skull -- the neurosurgeons do this -- a
[11]small hole. And then this shunt is inserted into the internal
[12]water cavity of the brain called the ventricle. Catheters are
[13]connected and the incision is closed.
[14]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) And this is the shunt placement that he
[15]had done February 9th of '07?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. Okay.
[18]A. So you are left with a scar where they went in. It is
[19]usually a small scar.
[20]Q. And, Doctor, do these shunts last forever?
[21]A. Well, one hopes that they last forever. But they can get
[22]clogged. They can get broken. So one of the potential
[23]complications of spina bifida is you get a plugged shunt.
[24]Q. Okay.
[25]A. And I think Stevie has been spared that so far. I don't
Pg. 630
[1]think, if I recall correctly, he has had a shunt revision.
[2]Q. But shunt revisions, are they common in people that have
[3]these types of shunts?
[4]A. It depends on what you mean by "common." If you mean do
[5]they occur more than 51 [*30]  percent of the time, no. But they're
[6]common enough that they have to be looked for. In other words,
[7]the people who follow Stevie are very aware that this shunt
[8]could block up. And there are certain symptoms associated with
[9]that blockage. If he started developing very bad headaches or
[10]his balance got worse or he was having unexplained vomiting,
[11]these are some of the symptoms that, when they occur in a child
[12]like this, you don't sort of sit back and watch, you've got to
[13]get them worked up immediately.
[14]Q. Okay. Let me -- the polydactyl procedure, I think we've
[15]talked about that. That's the removal of the -- and you have
[16]gone through the records where they removed the extra thumb,
[17]right?
[18]A. Yeah. This is quite a complication hand procedure. This
[19]deformity that he was born with was called a Wassel deformity,
[20]a Type IV, and it took a lot of skill on the part of the hand
[21]surgeon, and I think it came out pretty well.
[22]Q. Thank you.
[23]And let's talk about the clubbed feet so that we will know
[24]what we are looking at here. This is an artist's rendition of
[25]a normal foot and a clubfoot, right?
Pg.  [*31]  631
[1]A. So this is what I was referring to, that the feet are
[2]turned in and they are kind of fixated there and contracted
[3]there. So they try to release this to get the foot position to
[4]be a little more normal.
[5]Q. And he had -- with regard to that, they've done the
[6]Achilles tenotomies and Achilles tendon release, the right foot
[7]clubfoot repair, and the surgical repair of the bilateral
[8]clubfoot, plus the braces that he's had?
[9]A. Right. So these are all the attempts to try to correct
[10]these clubbed feet without surgery and with surgery.
[11]Q. And these braces, do they wear out?
[12]A. I don't know that they wear out, but they need to be
[13]changed because the foot changes its conformation as he grows.
[14]I guess sometimes they wear out.
[15]Q. Okay. And as he grows, he will have to have newer braces
[16]that fit him, right?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Okay. So I want to switch gears now to the -- back to his
[19]bowel problems.
[20]Why is Stevie not able to have a normal bowel movement?
[21]A. So his spina bifida has damaged the nerves to his bowel, as
[22]well as his bladder, so his bowel doesn't [*32]  work right. And
[23]patients with this can get very severe constipation. It can be
[24]like a rock mass in the colon. And it also results in fecal
[25]leakage, which is socially a big problem for patients with
Pg. 632
[1]spina bifida.
[2]So a number of years ago, a Dr. Malone came up with a way
[3]to try to establish normal bowel function.
[4]Q. So without a Malone antegrade -- or before he got the
[5]Malone antegrade continence enema procedure, let's talk about
[6]what happened before then -- and I'm going to get the date.
[7]So he had the procedure May 5th of 2012. Apparently, he
[8]was -- if I am right -- about five years old, right?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. So for the first five years of your life, how does one
[11]remove the feces from their bowels before the Malone antegrade
[12]continence enema procedure?
[13]A. Well, you can try a standard enema or sometimes you have to
[14]actually reach into the bowel with a gloved hand and extract
[15]the feces if they're very hard. It's not a good long-term
[16]solution.
[17]Q. And does that require putting somebody on a plastic, a
[18]piece of plastic, and having digital stimulation of the [*33]  bowel
[19]to try and get it to --
[20]A. Well, that's one of the approaches, but if your sensation
[21]is reduced down there, I'm not sure that's terribly effective.
[22]Q. So as a result of this, the Malone antegrade -- the MACE
[23]procedure improves the bowel situation, right?
[24]A. That's the idea.
[25]MR. WILLIAMS: Okay. I think we have a video on that,
Pg. 633
[1]please. Same exhibit number as the last one.
[2](Video played)
[3]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Okay. Can you?
[4]A. So the surgeon would do the following things here.
[5]MR. WILLIAMS: Can we stop that? Stop that for just a
[6]second, please, Ron. Thank you.
[7]A. So he takes the appendix, which is this tiny part of the
[8]intestine, which really doesn't have much use in humans, and he
[9]mobilizes it, meaning he gets it away for the rest of the
[10]bowel.
[11]So here you are seeing the colon, the small intestines, and
[12]the pelvic bone. This is what the surgeon would see.
[13]MR. WILLIAMS: Okay. Go ahead, Ron.
[14]A. So this is basically a bag of saline or water. And what
[15]happens is, he takes the appendix and moves it out to the skin.
[16] [*34]  And that's called a stoma. So rather than leaving the appendix
[17]in the intestine, he's brought it out to the skin, and it
[18]attaches to the water bag through this hole. It's called the
[19]stoma.
[20]Q. Okay. So let's orient ourselves a little bit on this.
[21]This was done when he was five years old, May 14th of 2012.
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. And then there was a revision November 11th of 2013, and a
[24]bowel tube placement November 8th of 2013, a year and a half or
[25]so later, right?
Pg. 634
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. So have there been complications, I guess, arising from the
[3]first surgery?
[4]A. Well, the complications have been this hole, which is
[5]called the stoma, and sometimes it gets stenotic, meaning it is
[6]no longer the right size, and it's difficult to get the
[7]catheter in. I don't know what you are going to show here.
[8]But what happens is that this water bag --
[9]Can we go back?
[10]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Sorry about that.
[11]A. So about once day Stevie has to have that water bag filled
[12]up, and then it runs through the stoma into his large colon.
[13]And it takes maybe an hour, and he's got to sit [*35]  on the toilet
[14]during that time because what happens is the water goes into
[15]the bowel and then moves the bowel, and then the feces go into
[16]the toilet. So the idea of this is to give someone a
[17]relatively normal sense of being able to go to the bathroom and
[18]evacuate the bowel and to prevent fetal -- sorry -- to prevent
[19]fecal leakage into the diaper.
[20]Q. And Stevie wears diapers.
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And as a result of him being incontinent and having the
[23]Malone procedure and not having the normal -- well, will that
[24]continue, his need to wear diapers?
[25]A. Yes, because the fecal leakage can still occur, and, you
Pg. 635
[1]know, that's socially a bad problem. This water or saline goes
[2]in then. If it goes in too fast, you get bad cramps so you
[3]have got to kind of sit there for an hour while this goes in
[4]and then evacuates into the toilet.
[5]Q. Does a person in Stevie's condition have the feeling of
[6]when he needs to urinate or have a bowel movement, or are those
[7]feelings pretty much gone?
[8]A. I don't think he has got natural feelings because of the
[9]nerve damage to evacuate the bowel or [*36]  the bladder. That has to
[10]be done for him or by him.
[11]Q. And because of the lack of, I guess, nerves there, do
[12]you -- is there a chance of leakage, both urinary leakage and
[13]fecal leakage?
[14]A. There still is a chance, although the Malone procedure
[15]really reduces the chance and the catheterization reduces the
[16]chance, but anatomically the cause is still there.
[17]Q. Okay. Does he have the muscles to hold his bowels tight or
[18]do you know?
[19]A. Well, he may have the muscles, but he doesn't have the
[20]nerves to the muscles. So after a while the muscles kind of
[21]disappear because they don't have any nerve input to them.
[22]Q. And Stevie's 10 years old. But while we are talking about
[23]this area, do you know whether or not Stevie will have a normal
[24]sexual life?
[25]A. I think it's too soon to really tell about that. He's not
Pg. 636
[1]into puberty. On the positive side, he has got some movement
[2]in the legs. So maybe there would be that capacity.
[3]Q. But --
[4]A. But I couldn't say with certainty that he'll be able to
[5]have that capacity for intimate relationships.
[6]Q. Is it too early [*37]  to know, or do you know whether or not he
[7]will be able to have either an erection or ejaculation of the
[8]sperm in order to have children?
[9]A. Well, that's what I'm saying. I don't think we are going
[10]to really know about that until he's into puberty. If he had
[11]no movement of the legs, I would say it was impossible. But he
[12]does have some movement of the legs, and so maybe something can
[13]be done for that.
[14]Q. Okay. Let's shift gears to the tethered cord surgeries, if
[15]we can. And I've got a drawing here. And so that you can help
[16]us understand, if you would, with the aid of this anatomical
[17]drawing.
[18]A. So where it says "tethered," it shows the scar tissue that
[19]fixates the spinal cord to the bone in an abnormal way.
[20]Q. Where are we looking? I know we have --
[21]A. Can I -- you can't see me point, right?
[22]Q. No. No, I'm trying to orient us.
[23]This is what part of the body?
[24]A. So this is the base of the spine. These are the vertebral
[25]bodies and the spinal cord going down into the tailbone.
Pg. 637
[1]Q. Okay. Tailbone area, that's what I wanted to get out.
[2]And the spinal [*38]  cord inside there, as a result of the spina
[3]bifida -- what does "tethered" mean? What are we talking
[4]about?
[5]A. Tethered means abnormally attached. Usually the spine, the
[6]spinal cord is not fixated and attached at the base, but in
[7]spina bifida, because of all the scarring, it becomes attached.
[8]Q. And so what if it becomes attached. Why do you have to
[9]surgically unattach it.
[10]A. Because if it is not treated, and the child's spine
[11]continues to grow, the nerves that more and more stretched, and
[12]that could weaken what power he has in the legs.
[13]Q. And he's has that release on October 5 of 2012, and then
[14]again December 16th of 2016, right?
[15]A. Right.
[16]Q. And if you have there the notes -- let's look at the 2016
[17]surgery for just a moment. Do you have a copy of the records
[18]there?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Can you find the 2016 surgery?
[21]A. There are a lot of records here, I'm not…
[22]Q. It's going to be at the very bottom, Doctor. I think
[23]they're in chronological order.
[24]A. I'm sorry.
[25]Q. Okay. Let me just -- let me -- can I show you?
Pg. 638
[1]A. [*39]  Sure.
[2]Q. Could you find it?
[3]So this is Stevie Gonzalez, sometimes referred to as
[4]Esteban Gonzales.
[5]A. Right.
[6]Q. December 16th, some five or six months ago, right?
[7]A. Right.
[8]Q. And they redid his lumbar laminectomy for release of
[9]retethered spinal cord, right?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. Was this a complication then -- why does it retether?
[12]A. Well, they had released it once, but it got tethered again.
[13]Q. Okay. So --
[14]A. So they had to go in and redo the release.
[15]Q. Why does it become retethered? That's what I'm -- what I
[16]want to find out.
[17]A. Well, I mean, that's a good question. I think one reason
[18]is you've got a lot of scar tissue there. The vertebral column
[19]starts to grow, and some of the tethering reattaches itself.
[20]Q. Okay.
[21]And it talks about the skin incision. These are the
[22]surgeons notes?
[23]A. Yes, neurosurgeon's.
[24]Q. Okay. And they brought in a microscope to do this surgery,
[25]right?
Pg. 639
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And meticulously with sharp microdissection, and the cord
[3]was completely freed, right? [*40] 
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. Okay. And fortunately Stevie had no complications on this
[6]procedure, right?
[7]A. Right.
[8]Q. Okay. Thank you.
[9]A. So this surgery is done now through a microscope, so it is
[10]very precise.
[11]Q. Okay. Moving along, the Botox bladder injections, we saw
[12]that he had those.
[13]And why would you -- I think of Botox as something that is
[14]to get rid of wrinkles, but I guess it has other purposes. So
[15]can you explain why he would --
[16]A. Well, it works on the bladder like it does with the
[17]wrinkles. It relaxes the muscles, and the problem is the
[18]bladder gets very tight, so Botox is a way to relax the
[19]bladder.
[20]Q. And do they have to do that under general anesthesia?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And how many times -- why did they have to relax his
[23]bladder?
[24]A. He's catheterizing himself a number of times a day, and if
[25]that bladder is very tight, it is going to be very difficult to
Pg. 640
[1]get the urine to flow. So they want to try to make the
[2]physiology of the bladder as normal as they can.
[3]Q. Okay. Was it successful do they think?
[4]A. [*41]  I believe so.
[5]Q. Now, you and I have put together a chart showing the total
[6]number of hospitalizations and hospital stays -- days he's had
[7]up until now, right?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. So in the first 10 years of his life, he spent 42 days in
[10]the hospital --
[11]A. Right.
[12]Q. -- for the various surgeries.
[13]Some of them, fortunately, were as short as -- well, there
[14]was one day for the surgical revision of the MACE procedure?
[15]A. Right.
[16]Q. But like the Botox was four days, and there was some other
[17]stuff done with the Botox right then, right?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. Oh. The first chance of trying to do the Botox, he had to
[20]be scuttled because of complications?
[21]A. Right. He had a nosebleed that got into his lungs, and he
[22]had to go into the intensive care unit.
[23]Q. Okay. I would like to get to the real world about Stevie's
[24]condition, and I would like to show you, the jury a few seconds
[25]of his day-in-the-life and have you then comment on it.
Pg. 641
[1]MR. WILLIAMS: If we can have the first one?
[2]THE COURT: What exhibit number is this, Mr. Williams?
[3] [*42]  MR. WILLIAMS: Can we use the same exhibit number I've
[4]been using for all this, or do we need to break it down, your
[5]Honor?
[6]THE COURT: Okay. 2469. These are all --
[7]MR. WILLIAMS: If we can. Thank you.
[8](Video played)
[9]A. So here are the braces, which are called AFOs.
[10]Okay. Let's -- can you run that back? I know it's real --
[11]I wanted to keep them short.
[12]MR. SMITH: Could we approach for just a second.
[13]THE COURT: You may.
[14](Following proceedings held at sidebar:)
[15]MR. SMITH: Does this have Ms. Raquel speaking?
[16]MR. WILLIAMS: No.
[17]MR. SMITH: No portion of it?
[18]MR. WILLIAMS: Right.
[19]MR. SMITH: Okay. Thank you.
[20](Following proceedings held in open court:)
[21](Portion of day-in-the-life played)
[22]MR. WILLIAMS: Yes. Play it just a second and stop
[23]it, if you would. Yeah.
[24]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) So why -- what's an AFO? I know what a
[25]UFO is.
Pg. 642
[1]A. It's a splint. So it's trying to keep the foot in the most
[2]normal position possible.
[3]MR. WILLIAMS: Okay. Go ahead, Ron.
[4](Portion of day-in-the-life played)
[5] [*43]  A. You can see that he scoots around pretty well. He's
[6]manipulating his splints.
[7]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Okay.
[8]A. So you can see the upper body strength is really pretty
[9]good. He is able to get himself up.
[10]Q. But he has limited lower body strength.
[11]A. Very limited.
[12]Q. Now, he can walk with crutches, correct?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. How far?
[15]A. Some short distance.
[16]Q. Okay.
[17]Most the time he is in a wheelchair or a significant part
[18]of the time?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Will he ever get more strength in his legs or more mobility
[21]in his legs?
[22]A. He may be able to use his legs better. I don't look for
[23]the strength changing. And there is some concern that when you
[24]get into adolescence, there might about a weakening a little
[25]bit in the strength of the legs.
Pg. 643
[1]Q. And why does that occur?
[2]A. I don't know that anyone knows for certain, but, you know,
[3]with the growing of the body and the hormonal changes, it has
[4]been the observation of some of the rehab doctors that the
[5]strength goes down a little bit.
[6]Q. And what is the use, [*44]  continuous use -- or the use of
[7]crutches, what does that do to one's shoulders over a lifetime
[8]and all?
[9]A. What does it do to the shoulders?
[10]Q. Yes, sir.
[11]A. Well, if they're not properly used and the upper body isn't
[12]strengthened, it can cause problems in the shoulder,
[13]dislocations and things like that.
[14]Q. Okay.
[15]MR. WILLIAMS: Let's go to the next video of -- if you
[16]would, Ron, please.
[17]Okay. We will skip it and we'll go to the next one,
[18]and hopefully it will play.
[19]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) What I want to talk to you about is his
[20]wheelchair. I noticed he has got handles on the wheelchair.
[21]What kind of a wheelchair is that?
[22]A. That's called a Wijit wheelchair, and rather than trying to
[23]push the wheels on the chair, you get a little more leverage if
[24]you work these handles back and forth, and you can see he's
[25]pretty good at that.
Pg. 644
[1]Q. Right.
[2](Video playing.)
[3]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) And these handles are brakes too, I
[4]guess?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. Do you think he will need the use of a wheelchair the
[7]remainder of his life? [*45] 
[8]A. Yes, I do.
[9]MR. WILLIAMS: Let's go to the next video, Ron.
[10](Video playing.)
[11]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) So there is a mechanism inside of those
[12]handles. Does it have gears, do you know, like a bike you can
[13]go to first gear or second gear or something?
[14]A. I'm not aware it has gears. You know, he is working pretty
[15]hard to get up a small grade here.
[16]Q. Okay.
[17]MR. WILLIAMS: And, Ron, let's go to the final video,
[18]please.
[19](Video playing.)
[20]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) This is not the final video, I'm sorry.
[21]This is the next-to-final.
[22]And so there's adaptive things you need in order to get a
[23]wheelchair into a bus or a car, right?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. But he can --
Pg. 645
[1]A. He transfers pretty well.
[2]Q. Yep.
[3]What do you do with the wheelchair then?
[4]A. Well, someone has got to get it into the back of the van.
[5]Q. Okay.
[6]A. It is pretty heavy.
[7]Q. Now, Doctor, can you predict -- do you think Stevie will
[8]have complications from his condition in the future?
[9]A. I do think he will have complications.
[10] [*46]  Q. Any question about that?
[11]A. No.
[12]Q. Can you predict with any probability which of the various
[13]complications will pop up first or will pop up?
[14]A. I really can't predict it. When I looked over my
[15]deposition last night, I saw that defense counsel had asked me
[16]a number of times, Can you say with medical certainty that this
[17]will occur or that will occur? And my answer was, No, I can't
[18]say with medical certainty that he'll need -- that the shunt
[19]will be blocked or so forth. But if you take all of these
[20]disabilities together and all of the complications he's had so
[21]far in his life, I think within medical probability, which
[22]means 51 percent or more, that, yes, he will require care for
[23]future contingencies.
[24]Q. And by that -- and if you had been asked -- for instance,
[25]since your deposition was taken, he's had a couple of
Pg. 646
[1]complications, right?
[2]A. Right. I mean, if they were to ask me, and I think maybe
[3]they did, is it within medical probability that he'll have
[4]another tethered cord release, well, the chance of that is
[5]probably below 51 percent, and yet he's had to have it. So [*47]  not
[6]everything is 51 percent of more.
[7]Q. But when you look at it in its totality?
[8]A. Yeah, when you look at it together. Plus, good medical
[9]practice means that you take care of things in advance. I
[10]mean, you know, if we go to the doctor and there's a spot on
[11]the chest x-ray and the doctor says it's a 12 percent chance of
[12]cancer, well, no one sits around and waits until it gets to
[13]51 percent chance. You've got to move on it. And a lot of
[14]that is true with Stevie.
[15]Q. Okay. Someone who sits in a wheelchair a lot, do they have
[16]the potential for skin issues?
[17]A. The skin issues are because he doesn't really have
[18]sensation. So as we sit here, if we're resting too hard on
[19]part of our backside, we shift our position. But Stevie
[20]doesn't have that feedback.
[21]Q. And so how does that affect him?
[22]A. Well, it just means that his skin can be broken down
[23]because he's not sensing to change his posture, and you don't
[24]want skin breakdown when you have something this complicated.
[25]That just introduces a whole new layer of medical concern.
Pg. 647
[1]Q. When you say "skin breakdown," you [*48]  mean ulcers, right,
[2]or…
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. Red spots that become decubitus ulcers?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. Okay. In taking care in -- looking at his future, do you
[7]believe that he is going to need some future care help, even
[8]when he is an adult, to help him with his life, doing what he
[9]needs to do on a daily basis?
[10]A. Are you asking about daily activities?
[11]Q. Yes, sir.
[12]A. I think that Stevie, on the cognitive side, is doing pretty
[13]well. I don't think it is perfect, but he's doing pretty well.
[14]But he's got a very complicated regimen, and he is taking care
[15]of it. But as I say, it's got to be meticulous. Someone has
[16]to be around if he starts getting sick. I mean, one of the
[17]problems I have seen with spina bifida is people -- and spinal
[18]cord injury -- that they don't have sensation, so, you know,
[19]they start to get this infection from the kidneys, and they
[20]think, well, I'm just getting a flu or something like that, and
[21]then all of a sudden, you have got a disaster.
[22]So, I think, there needs to be someone to assist him with
[23]the daily activities and to make sure that his proper [*49]  health
[24]maintenance is going on, and that he is getting around to all
[25]of his doctors' appointments. I think that level of care.
Pg. 648
[1]Q. And you have discussed this with the life care planner,
[2]Ms. Parisi about the requirements of what he is going to need
[3]in the future, right?
[4]A. Yes.
[5](Conferring)
[6]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Doctor, let me show you Exhibit 2471.
[7]MR. WILLIAMS: And if I can have the ELMO, please.
[8]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) I did not put on here the -- I did not
[9]put on here -- this was prepared by Ms. Parisi, right?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. And Ms. Parisi did not put the columns where she has put
[12]the dollar amounts on there, but you and Ms. Parisi have gone
[13]through this life care plan, right?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And so I'm showing the jury Exhibit 2471, Appendix 1
[16]through Appendix 11, correct?
[17]Appendix 1 through 11?
[18]A. I'm sorry.
[19]Q. I'm asking you. Just so we can confirm for the record that
[20]there are 11 appendixes -- appendices, in here?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And each and every one of these you have gone through
[23]with --
[24] [*50]  A. Yes.
[25]Q. -- Ms. Parisi?
Pg. 649
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. The need for physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech
[3]therapy, psychological evaluations, and neuropsych, or
[4]neuropsychological evaluations, right?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. And y'all have gone through this with regard to a case
[7]management person and counseling, right?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And the frequency of all of these things, right?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. And the need to go to the spina bifida clinic and have
[12]follow-ups with various doctors, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. And you have gone through additional diagnostic testing,
[15]specialty care, and primary care, right?
[16]A. Right.
[17]Q. By the way, I have got up here life expectancy, 67 years.
[18]That comes from a government table, if you know. Do you know
[19]if that comes for the government tables on life expectancy?
[20]A. I'd have to look it up. I mean, life expectancy for
[21]conditions like this are directly related to his care, his
[22]success in preventing complications, things that would shorten
[23]his life.
[24]Q. So if he gets good care do you anticipate he will [*51]  have a
[25]normal life expectancy?
Pg. 650
[1]A. No, I don't think he will have -- 67 is not a normal life
[2]expectancy.
[3]Q. Well, wait a minute. That's at age 10. So 67, plus 10
[4]years -- he's already at 10.
[5]A. Okay. Well, I mean, I think it's worth striving for. But,
[6]you know, there's a lot that needs to be done to ensure that
[7]people with spina bifida reach their full life span.
[8]Q. Okay. And that's what you have tried to achieve with this
[9]life care plan, is give him what he needs?
[10]A. What's necessary and reasonable care.
[11]Q. Yes, ma'am -- yes, sir.
[12]And you have got in here some drugs, Zantac and
[13]antibiotics?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Why does he need that?
[16]A. Antibiotics, because of the history of urinary tract
[17]infections primarily.
[18]Q. And then you have looked at supplies. There is various
[19]supplies that go along with having the catheter and supplies
[20]that go along with having the MACE procedure?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. Okay. And Ms. Parisi will put -- you have looked at the --
[23]you have made the list and looked at the frequency, and she
[24]will put in [*52]  the numbers, right?
[25]A. Yes.
Pg. 651
[1]Q. Okay. And then medical equipment, you have talked about
[2]the bilateral AFOs. Those are the braces?
[3]A. Right.
[4]Q. Crutches?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. The Wijit wheelchair?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. The cushion maintaining the wheelchair and roll-in shower
[9]chair that he will need to have?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. Hand-held shower head and adapted hand bike. You have
[12]looked into that, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. And a van that will have wheelchair modifications where
[15]he -- I guess he could drive with hand modifications?
[16]A. I think that's potential, yes.
[17]Q. And a wheelchair -- a van that will get him and his
[18]wheelchair into the van.
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Okay.
[21]Home modifications? He will need some type of home care
[22]modifications?
[23]A. Well, with the wheelchair and the other requirements, the
[24]home has to be situated to be able to provide that.
[25]Q. And you have provided in here for some oversight, perhaps,
Pg. 652
[1]a visiting nurse occasionally, a home health aide and et cetera
[2]to oversee his health condition, [*53]  right?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And the frequency you have put in there.
[5]Okay. I'm going to try to go through these appendices.
[6]And you can -- do you believe that he will able to live by
[7]himself, or would he be better off in a group home, or in a
[8]home where he has some supervision to help him with his health
[9]problems?
[10]A. Well, the group home is an alternative to home care, but
[11]it's maybe not the preferable alternative. I mean, Stevie is
[12]very cognizant of his condition, and he really needs to be in
[13]the least restrictive environment, and, you know, mom is
[14]looking after this right now. And I don't know we could always
[15]assume that's the case.
[16]Q. And three hospital days a year, is that the frequency that
[17]you believe is reasonable?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. He may not have three every year, but he may have a week or
[20]10 days every third year, right?
[21]A. Right. Well, he's already had, since my depo, two
[22]admissions.
[23]Q. You mentioned Stevie is highly conscious of his disability.
[24]What do you mean?
[25]A. I think that he knows what's going on. He sees himself
Pg. 653
[1]compared [*54]  to other children. And I think this is frustration
[2]for him, and sometimes he lashes out at home. Understandable.
[3]I guess I would say the difference with the Down's syndrome
[4]that I see with people, they have a diminished intellectual
[5]capacity, so they are pretty happy with their state and see the
[6]world through their own eyes. But, you know, Stevie has got
[7]more awareness than that.
[8]Q. And will he benefit from some psychiatric and psychological
[9]help to deal with this situation?
[10]A. Well, this is one of these things as -- does he need it
[11]now? I would say no. Will he need it in the future to make
[12]adjustment to the world? You know, I would say it needs to be
[13]available.
[14]Q. Doctor, have your opinions been based on reasonable medical
[15]probability?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. Anything I've forgotten to go over with you about Stevie's
[18]condition? Anything I've missed?
[19]A. Nothing I can think of at the moment.
[20]Q. He's a pretty good kid, isn't he?
[21]A. What's that?
[22]Q. He's a pretty good kid, isn't he?
[23]A. Stevie is a great kid. I really enjoyed meeting him and
[24]interacting. [*55]  I saw him outside the courtroom today, and I
[25]asked did he remember me, and he said no. So I think he had
Pg. 654
[1]more of an impression on me than I had on him. But, you know,
[2]he sees a lot of doctors. So, yeah, he's a very engaging
[3]child.
[4]MR. WILLIAMS: Okay. Thank you, Doctor, for coming, I
[5]appreciate it.
[6]We will pass the witness, your Honor.
[7]THE COURT: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, you need
[8]a short break? Okay. I don't think lunches are here. Do you
[9]want to go a little bit? Are we okay? All right.
[10]Cross examination.
[11]MR. SMITH: Thank you, your Honor.
[12]CROSS EXAMINATION
[13]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) Hi, Dr. Lott. I'm Joel Smith.
[14]A. Good morning.
[15]Q. Nice to see you. I don't have a lot to ask you, but I
[16]wanted to just cover a few things. First of all, you are not
[17]Stevie Gonzalez's doctor, right?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. You were retained by counsel for the plaintiffs --
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. -- to provide some damages testimony, which is what you
[22]have just done?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. Okay. And you are not -- let me just -- you have not
[25]spoken [*56]  to Stevie's doctors, true?
Pg. 655
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. And you didn't speak to any of Stevie's school teachers or
[3]folks who have evaluated him at school?
[4]A. That's correct.
[5]Q. But you have seen their reports.
[6]A. I have.
[7]Q. Okay. The only family member that you have talked to was
[8]Ms. Raquel, his mother.
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. And you did that when you did this evaluation.
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. At an airport hotel in…
[13]A. Sacramento.
[14]Q. Sacramento.
[15]And the kinds of evaluations that are done in the
[16]litigation sessions are clearly done this way, right?
[17]A. Well, they're done a variety of ways, but often they can be
[18]done in a conference room.
[19]Q. Okay. And so it's nothing unusual about being asked as a
[20]medical professional to do litigation analysis and seeing a
[21]patient in a conference room in a hotel?
[22]A. I guess not, right.
[23]Q. Okay.
[24]But you had the chance to interact with Ms. Raquel a bit,
[25]right?
Pg. 656
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. Was she the only one there? Did she bring him to you?
[3]A. She brought him to [*57]  me at the hotel. I can't recall. I
[4]believe there's a younger sister. I just can't recall whether
[5]that child was there or not.
[6]Q. Was she the only one supervising Stevie and his sister, if
[7]she's there?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And did she bring him to the facility, to the hotel on her
[10]own.
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. Okay. And was she able to carry on a conversation with you
[13]and interact and tell you about herself and about Stevie?
[14]A. Yes, mainly about Stevie, right.
[15]Q. You didn't notice any difficulty with her communicating and
[16]answering questions about the things that were important to you
[17]in your testimony in this lawsuit?
[18]A. I think that's correct.
[19]Q. Okay.
[20]Now, Doctor, we saw your CV, which is -- "CV" stands for
[21]curriculum vitae, right?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. That's really like a resume.
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Right. And it lists all of the articles and all of the
Pg. 657
[1]terrific research you have done on Down's syndrome and
[2]Alzheimer's and on aging, right?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And of all the 104 publications there, none of them are
[5]about spina [*58]  bifida.
[6]A. That is correct.
[7]Q. I looked really hard in your CV to see if I could find the
[8]words "spina bifida" there. They're not there, are they?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. Okay. And I don't mean to disparage that. You have done
[11]some wonderful things and written some very important articles,
[12]particularly on Alzheimer's and Down's syndrome. But you don't
[13]consider yourself a specialist on spina bifida, right?
[14]A. Not a specialist, a general neurologist who has seen spina
[15]bifida in the course of his practice.
[16]Q. Okay. But you haven't ever examined an adult spina bifida
[17]patient, correct?
[18]A. I have seen adults with spina bifida in my telemedicine
[19]practice.
[20]Q. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "Telemedicine," meaning you do
[21]this over sort of like Skype; is that right?
[22]A. The telemedicine practice is to provide services for remote
[23]centers, and it is a big screen interaction but not hands-on.
[24]Q. All right. So maybe I should state that differently. You
[25]have never examined or treated an adult spina bifida patient in
Pg. 658
[1]person?
[2]A. That would be correct.
[3] [*59]  Q. Okay. And as a pediatric neurologist, you wouldn't see
[4]patients past age 21?
[5]A. Twenty-one is generally the cutoff.
[6]Q. Okay. You -- let's -- I want to make sure we're clear
[7]about something. We can agree on the fact that Stevie Gonzalez
[8]has a significant array of disabilities from his spina bifida,
[9]correct?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. Okay. And your role was to look at his current medicals --
[12]medical records.
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. Interview him, interview his mother, and look at some
[15]school records and other social records, and make some
[16]predictions about the future; is that right?
[17]A. Yes. I would just say I also examined him.
[18]Q. I meant to include that; if I didn't, I'm sorry.
[19]A. Yeah.
[20]Q. And then you developed some opinions about his future.
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And those opinions are supposed to be based on evidence
[23]and, of course, your experience?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Okay. And those opinions that you have should fairly
Pg. 659
[1]represent the evidence that you have reviewed?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. And not lean one way or the other, but fairly represent
[4] [*60]  him, right?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. And you understand that if I asked you questions about the
[7]evidence supporting your opinions, I'm not suggesting that
[8]Stevie doesn't have this array of disabilities caused by spina
[9]bifida, I'm just asking about the evidence supporting your
[10]opinions?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. Okay.
[13]You found, as you said, Stevie to be engaging and social?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And you felt that he -- he had age appropriate social
[16]interactions and a good sense of humor?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Okay. You testified about a list of things here --
[19]MR. SMITH: Could we have the ELMO, please --
[20]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) And the first -- this is the list that we
[21]were looking at that Mr. Williams put up. And it has a list of
[22]what -- it says Stevie's physical injuries, correct? Do you
[23]see that?
[24]A. Yes, his medical injuries, yes.
[25]Q. I was just reading the top.
Pg. 660
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And the first thing it says is spina bifida?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And then the second thing it says is hydrocephalus?
[5]A. Right.
[6]Q. But hydrocephalus is a symptom [*61]  of spina bifida, correct?
[7]A. Hydrocephalus is associated with spina bifida, at least
[8]with myelomeningocele.
[9]Q. All right. It's a part of the neural tube defect.
[10]A. It's the result of the neural tube defect.
[11]Q. Okay. And this Chiari brain malfunction is a result of the
[12]neural tube defect?
[13]A. As a malformation. Yes, same answer.
[14]Q. Right. So when we are looking at spina bifida, which is a
[15]particular type of neural tube defect, that causes an array of
[16]issues?
[17]A. Yes. "Spina bifida" is the general term and it has various
[18]presentations. The most severe is the myelomeningocele.
[19]Q. All right. And the myelomeningocele includes frequently
[20]hydrocephalus, Chiari brain malformations, neurogenic bowel and
[21]bladder issues that he has, the clubbed feet, and the tethered
[22]spinal cord. Those are all part of that array?
[23]A. Highly associated, yes.
[24]Q. And they are a result of the neural tube issue.
[25]A. They're a sequelae of the neural tube problem, yes.
Pg. 661
[1]Q. We've heard that referred to as "NTDs," neural tube
[2]defects, right?
[3]A. Yes.
[4] [*62]  Q. So all of these things here are a part of the sequelae of
[5]neural tube defects, right?
[6]A. Yes, very highly associated.
[7]Q. The other thing that is not highly associated with that is
[8]the polydactyly, right?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. The thumb?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. These are Stevie's surgeries. This is the same slide that
[13]you were just referring to?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And the polydactyly repair is right here?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. All these surgeries and procedures, 1 through 12, with the
[18]exception of polydactyly would be the types of surgeries that
[19]you would expect for a child with this type of neural tube
[20]defect?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And the skin care issue you mentioned, that would also fall
[23]within the same category.
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. You mentioned that the polydactyly had been surgically
Pg. 662
[1]corrected.
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. And you have talked about how complicated this surgery was.
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. But it was quite successful, wasn't it?
[6]A. I think so, yes.
[7]Q. Your report says he has a well-healed scar over the medial
[8]aspect [*63]  of his right thumb?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. And your report doesn't mention any complications from
[11]that.
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. Or any disability from that.
[14]A. Right.
[15]Q. You mention in your report that he has decreased mobility
[16]due to spina bifida, and that's clear from the video we've
[17]seen, right?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. You said in your report that he can walk on crutches,
[20]perhaps, one block before becoming fatigued?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. All right. And that's information that you got from
[23]Ms. Raquel, right?
[24]A. I got it from the mother, and I also had him walk for me in
[25]the conference room.
Pg. 663
[1]Q. In the conference room?
[2]A. Yeah.
[3]Q. Have you reviewed Stevie's school records in forming your
[4]opinions?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]MR. SMITH: Could we see Defendant's Exhibit 2373, at
[7]Page 43, first.
[8]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) I'm going to have this put on your screen.
[9]MR. SMITH: Thank you, Deana. Let's look at the first
[10]page of that first.
[11]I'm sorry, Page 43. It's 3273.43.
[12]Is that right?
[13]MR. WILLIAMS: I think it is 32, Mr. Smith. [*64] 
[14]MR. SMITH: I'm sorry. It is 3273.
[15]MR. WILLIAMS: Dyslexic.
[16]MR. SMITH: I am. I am. I'm sorry. It is the truth.
[17]3273.
[18](Conferring)
[19]MR. SMITH: All right, let's try 3459. Ah, that's it.
[20]Okay.
[21]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) What is that document?
[22]A. This is a -- what's called an "IEP." It is an
[23]individualized education program.
[24]Q. Do you see that up right there at the top?
[25]And this is a report -- is this report generated by the
Pg. 664
[1]folks at his school?
[2]A. I'm sorry. What was the question?
[3]Q. Who generates this report?
[4]A. I did read the report. Is that what you asked me?
[5]Q. No. Who generates it?
[6]A. Oh, it is generated generally by a committee in the school
[7]consisting of teachers and other people who may be relevant to
[8]the problem.
[9]Q. Okay. Let's go to the third page here, which is 4359.3.
[10]Okay. And can we look at the paragraph gross/fine motor skills
[11]there at the first paragraph?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. All right. This says, "Gross motor: Stevie primarily uses
[14]his crutches when walking around campus and in the classroom. [*65] 
[15]At times he prefers to scoot around, but he is encouraged to
[16]use his crutches."
[17]I assume "scoot around" means use his wheelchair.
[18]"On the bus to and from school Stevie is transported in his
[19]wheelchair."
[20]And then it says, "Stevie does well using crutches. He is
[21]able to walk the entire school day from one end of campus to
[22]the other, uses his crutches without observable fatigue, and he
[23]enjoys demonstrating how well he can dance and walk around and
[24]walk backwards when using his crutches."
[25]Right?
Pg. 665
[1]A. Yes, that's what it says.
[2]Q. Is that inconsistent with the testimony or the statement
[3]from Ms. Raquel that he could walk a block without getting
[4]fatigued?
[5]A. It's inconsistent with that. It's also inconsistent with
[6]what I observed about him. I had him walk around the
[7]conference room, which was maybe the size of this inner circle
[8]here, and he did it a couple of times, but then he got
[9]fatigued.
[10]Q. Okay.
[11]A. So I'm going to have to say my observations are a bit
[12]different.
[13]Q. Okay. Let's -- you mentioned that this examination was
[14]when [*66]  Stevie was eight and a half?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. And he's now 10.
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. And have you seen -- other than the hallway conversation
[19]you described earlier, have you seen him since that?
[20]A. No, I have not.
[21]Q. Okay. One of the elements of the life care plan is the
[22]assistance with bowel and bladder?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. And you believe that Stevie has the intelligence to do that
[25]into the future, right?
Pg. 666
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And he also has the fine motor skills to do that, doesn't
[3]he?
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. Okay. And, in fact, he's doing it now.
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Okay. It's really pretty impressive, isn't it, that he is
[8]able to do that himself?
[9]A. Yes, it is impressive.
[10]Q. It is even more impressive that he was able to do it at
[11]eight and a half.
[12]A. I think its a reflexion of his abilities, yes.
[13]Q. Okay. But it's your impression that he will need help to
[14]do that perfectly in the future?
[15]A. That's my concern. It's not enough just to do these
[16]things. You really need to do it with almost perfect
[17]performance.
[18] [*67]  Q. Mmm hmm. The life care plan that you were shown.
[19]MR. WILLIAMS: I don't --
[20]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) We know what we are talking about here.
[21]You were shown a life care plan --
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. -- without the numerical values on it, right?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Okay. And one of the things it says here is, Dr. Lott
Pg. 667
[1]states 2470 -- is that a seven or a one?
[2]MR. WILLIAMS: 2471.
[3]MR. SMITH: 2471, okay.
[4]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) It says on here Dr. Lott states that
[5]Esteban will not live independently, right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. And that has in there, because of that, 8 to 12 hours per
[8]day or live-in care; is that right?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. And it says this is for after age 21?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. So at age 21 until the end of his life expectancy, you
[13]believe he will need 8 to 12 hours per day of live-in care?
[14]A. I think he is going to need some live-in care. The
[15]current -- what mom is currently doing is around 10 hours a
[16]day. Now, after age 21, I'm trying to make the best
[17]prediction, and I feel that that level still needs to be
[18]available to him if he [*68]  needs it.
[19]Q. You did read -- his doctor is Dr. McDonald, right?
[20]A. One of his doctors, yes.
[21]Q. And you read Dr. McDonald's deposition?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. And Dr. McDonald was asked whether he thought he could live
[24]independently. Do you remember that?
[25]A. Probably.
Pg. 668
[1]MR. SMITH: Okay. And why don't we pull up
[2]Dr. McDonald's deposition. Do we have that?
[3]MR. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, if I may object. Asking
[4]this witness about another witness's testimony is, No. 1,
[5]improper, and Dr. McDonald will be here.
[6]MR. SMITH: Your Honor, it --
[7]MR. WILLIAMS: Maybe you should save it for that.
[8]MR. SMITH: Your Honor, he reviewed this as part of
[9]the basis for his opinion, and I just wanted to -- I'm doing
[10]nothing but covering information he's relied upon.
[11]THE COURT: Well, the objection is overruled. You can
[12]ask him.
[13]Is this on the computer?
[14]MR. SMITH: Have you got it? It's coming up.
[15]Q. (BY MR. SMITH:) And let's go to Page 118, Line 7, through
[16]21, okay. It's -- this is what I was reading. "Based on your
[17]experience in treating patients [*69]  like Esteban, will he require
[18]some sort of special living accommodations for the rest of his
[19]life?"
[20]And what Dr. McDonald said is, "I think that's difficult to
[21]predict, and largely it depends on his cognitive function and
[22]cognitive skills. Many of our patients with spina bifida will
[23]live independently, but if patients do have cognitive
[24]impairments or significant learning disabilities or
[25]differences, they may require some supervision for their
Pg. 669
[1]living."
[2]And then he says, "But I think without seeing more
[3]formalized cognitive assessment of Esteban, it would be
[4]difficult to speculate on that."
[5]Right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. And that's his doctor.
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And didn't you say pretty much the same things in your
[10]report?
[11]A. I didn't think exactly the same thing. I'm willing to say
[12]that his cognitive skills, except for maybe his math abilities,
[13]are pretty good. So this concern that was raised by
[14]Dr. McDonald, I mean, it would be nice to have more testing,
[15]but I think his cognitive skills are going to be adequate.
[16]Q. You said many aspects of his cognitive [*70]  status are normal --
[17]A. Yeah.
[18]Q. -- but more detailed testing is required, right?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. So you agree with Dr. McDonald that it would be speculative
[21]to consider whether or not he could live independently?
[22]A. Well, Dr. McDonald is basing that concern on not knowing
[23]his true cognitive status.
[24]Q. Right.
[25]A. My concern about living independently is, in part that, but
Pg. 670
[1]is in part what is really required to keep him healthy. And
[2]that just, in my view, would be not really possible to do on
[3]his own.
[4]Q. Do you agree with him that many spina bifida patients live
[5]independently?
[6]A. Some do, some don't.
[7]Q. I mean, he says many. Do you agree with that?
[8]A. I would have to see what he is referring to as many. I
[9]mean, we are talking about an individual child here, not a
[10]group or a statistic.
[11]Q. Right.
[12]A. So I'd need to see, but, yes, some do live independently.
[13]Q. Okay. And do you agree with him that that depends on his
[14]cognitive ability?
[15]A. Well, it depends on what other complications the other
[16]patients have. [*71]  In other words, do they have Malone, do they
[17]have a requirement for CIC. Do they have this history of all
[18]these complications? I think that's what went into my
[19]determination more than group statistics.
[20]Q. Right. You said you thought he would need psychiatric
[21]help?
[22]A. At the moment, I don't think he needs psychiatric help. I
[23]am concerned, however, about a couple things. One is he is
[24]cognitively aware of his deficit, and he gets very frustrated.
[25]And as he gets into adolescence, that's a problem. And then
Pg. 671
[1]the mother told me during my history taking, and I asked her
[2]several different ways. Yes, he's social in school, but does
[3]he have a best friend and she said no. That worries me a
[4]little bit. I mean, you know, he's very different from other
[5]children, and we would like to think that children would be
[6]accepting of this, but there's no guarantee.
[7]Q. You mentioned math difficulties. That's a problem with
[8]focus and distractibility.
[9]A. Well, if you look at his report cards, math is usually in
[10]the "needs improvement" category. I think it's not helped by
[11]the fact he's distractible. [*72] 
[12]Q. Let's look at that IEP again, if we could. Hold on one
[13]second. Let me give you the right exhibit number. So have you
[14]reviewed his May 4, 2017, IEP?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. You have?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Okay. I think that's 4125. Let's look at -- so this is a
[19]different document than we were looking at before, but this
[20]same group from his school would have gotten together and this
[21]is a -- periodically they do these reports, correct?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Let's look at 4125-3, which is the third page. Current
[24]academic levels, do you see that, right at the top?
[25]And do you see where it says Stevie decodes and comprehends
Pg. 672
[1]well? He scores at a 5th grade level on accelerated reader and
[2]STAR. I guess that's a standard testing assessment; is that
[3]correct?
[4]A. Right.
[5]Q. And then it talks about having difficulty remaining on
[6]task, right?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. He doesn't finish his tasks?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. Those are distractibility issues, right?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. Okay. And then let's go down to the next paragraph.
[13]That's math. And it says -- it, [*73]  again, talks about good
[14]thinking skills, comes up with good math strategies, his
[15]ability appears limited. For example, he will correctly answer
[16]the first couple of steps to a problem, but then he either
[17]becomes confused by steps or becomes off task, right?
[18]A. Right.
[19]Q. So he's not able to maintain focus enough to complete all
[20]his assignments?
[21]A. Well, that's hard to say. I mean, if he has a learning
[22]problem in getting math concepts, the attention deficit can be
[23]secondary to that, not the cause of it.
[24]Q. But this is talking about not being able to stay on task.
[25]He starts well but doesn't stay on task?
Pg. 673
[1]A. I understand. But if you have a child who is really
[2]struggling with concepts, very often they appear distracted.
[3]Q. Are you aware of any other diagnosis that Stevie has that
[4]are unrelated to spina bifida and unrelated to his birth
[5]defects that cause distractibility?
[6]A. Well, he has not been formally diagnosed as ADHD, but it
[7]keeps coming up. I don't recall any other entities.
[8]Q. Have you been told that he's been diagnosed with bipolar
[9]disorder? [*74] 
[10]A. I have not heard that.
[11]Q. Is that something that in children does cause
[12]distractibility?
[13]MR. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, may we approach?
[14]THE COURT: Well, Mr. Smith, do you have much more
[15]cross examination?
[16]MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I can finish with this shortly
[17]but I --
[18]THE COURT: Okay. Okay.
[19]MR. SMITH: Or we can stop.
[20]THE COURT: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, stand up
[21]and stretch. We are almost ready for lunch.
[22](Following proceedings held at sidebar:)
[23]THE COURT: I'm taking it this is news to you?
[24]MR. WILLIAMS: Is there a basis for it?
[25]MR. SMITH: Oh, yeah. It's in his medical -- it is in
Pg. 674
[1]her medical. You produced it to us.
[2]MR. BOUNDAS: You are saying that Stevie has been
[3]diagnosed with bipolar disorder?
[4]MR. SMITH: His mother said it.
[5]MR. BOUNDAS: You have no record of it.
[6]MR. SMITH: I'm getting ready to show it to him.
[7]MR. WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. The mother says it?
[8]MR. SMITH: The mother says it, the grandmother -- he
[9]is on Lamictal.
[10]MR. WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. The mother [*75]  has an MD
[11]from where?
[12]MR. SMITH: In her medical records that you
[13]produced -- no, no, no, no. In his medical records that you
[14]produced, it says grandmother says he has bipolar disorder. It
[15]is reported in the medical records. He is getting Lamictal. I
[16]have got three records that prove it.
[17]MR. BOUNDAS: Well, your Honor, let's cut through
[18]this. It's irrelevant, it's prejudicial. It has nothing to do
[19]with his injuries. So what. Let's assume it is true. What's
[20]the relevance?
[21]MR. SMITH: The relevance is easy, your Honor. If
[22]somebody is going to testify that he can't hold a job because
[23]of his cognitive issues, that the diagnostic and statistical
[24]manual that this doctor will admit that distractibility, which
[25]is what he is dealing with on cognitive issues, is related to
Pg. 675
[1]the -- is a diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. If you
[2]guys want to do this, I will give you those medical records.
[3]We can stop now. I'll give you the medical records.
[4]MR. BOUNDAS: It's totally irrelevant and prejudicial
[5]to inject the fact that he may or may not have bipolar
[6]disorder.
[7]MR. SMITH: [*76]  I can prove it's been diagnosed.
[8]MR. BOUNDAS: It is irrelevant.
[9]THE COURT: Is there a diagnosis of it or just the
[10]mother saying in the medical record or the grandmother saying
[11]it, telling a doctor that he has it?
[12]MR. SMITH: There is documented evidence of both of
[13]those things, plus he's taking Lamictal, and that's his medical
[14]record.
[15]MR. WILLIAMS: I think the answer to your question is,
[16]no, there is not any medical diagnosis.
[17]MR. SMITH: I think there's evidence that he has
[18]bipolar in the medical records that have been produced. It is
[19]clear and it's -- well, I'll tell you what. Show me he doesn't
[20]have it and I'll --
[21]MR. BOUNDAS: What is the -- the prejudicial impact of
[22]the -- of suggesting that this little boy has bipolar disorder
[23]has -- greatly outweighs any mental --
[24]THE COURT: Well, I agree. It greatly outweighs --
[25]you have in that he can't stay on task, whatever that is, but
Pg. 676
[1]to now go into -- in the medical records -- the grandmother
[2]says he has -- I mean, she may just be basing this on her own
[3]guesstimation, based on his mother. So…
[4]MR. [*77]  SMITH: Your Honor, how about we do this, if it
[5]suits you? I don't want you to make a decision that is not
[6]based on your view of the records. Why don't I get those
[7]records, show them to you, you can look at them over the lunch
[8]break. We can take a pause here, and then we can decide
[9]whether -- I think it is there is clear evidence in medical
[10]records that he is taking a mood stabilizer. It actually talks
[11]about why he is having the bipolar disorder, which I wasn't
[12]going to bring up, but it is the very thing that he just talked
[13]about, which is the aggressivity that he is having at home. He
[14]has already talked about it on direct examination.
[15]THE COURT: He's -- aggressivity.
[16]MR. SMITH: He did. He did.
[17]MR. BOUNDAS: Your Honor, the bottom line is, if this
[18]is so -- if you are balancing relevance and prejudice, this is
[19]not -- it so greatly outweighs it to suggest that he has
[20]psychiatric issues. That ties into the mother, all kinds of
[21]stuff.
[22]MR. SMITH: If you drop any claim that he has any
[23]cognitive deficit, if you don't raise any cognitive deficit at
[24]all.
[25]MR. BOUNDAS: Well, we haven't [*78]  --
Pg. 677
[1]MR. SMITH: Well, it is in his report, and your other
[2]folks are going to rely on that for is he going to be
[3]employable?
[4]MR. WILLIAMS: Employability is a different issue. We
[5]are not making any claims for cognitive deficit. That's on the
[6]record.
[7]MR. SMITH: Are you going to make a claim that he is
[8]employable -- or not employable?
[9]MR. WILLIAMS: We are making a claim that he has
[10]limited employment options because of his physical
[11]disabilities. We are not making any issues on cognitive.
[12]MR. BOUNDAS: Yes. We are not claiming that.
[13]THE COURT: And I didn't understand him to say
[14]anything about cognitive. I mean, even the psychiatric he was
[15]saying more because of his condition.
[16]MR. SMITH: His report says it's a cognitive issue.
[17]Other people -- it is not just what his testimony is here
[18]because other people, like the life care planner, are going to
[19]rely on that report. They don't have to be limited to what he
[20]said in the courtroom, so that's why I needed to explore that
[21]with him.
[22]MR. BOUNDAS: I think we --
[23]MR. WILLIAMS: I think he's cleared [*79]  it up.
[24]THE COURT: Right. No. So the objection is
[25]sustained. So we move on. Can you wrap this up?
Pg. 678
[1]MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I think I'm done. Let me
[2]just -- if you don't mind, I'll check.
[3]MR. WILLIAMS: I'll be very brief, your Honor.
[4]THE COURT: Okay.
[5](Following proceedings held in open court:)
[6]MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I am no longer going to stand
[7]in the way of the jury and their lunch. I have no questions.
[8]THE COURT: Okay. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
[9]Ladies and gentlemen, I just ask you to disregard
[10]those last statements from Dr. Lott on the questioning.
[11]Mr. Williams, do you have brief redirect?
[12]MR. WILLIAMS: Brief is the word.
[13]THE COURT: Because now you are standing between all
[14]of us and lunch.
[15]MR. WILLIAMS: And I am and I will -- you know, I like
[16]lunch too, Judge, you can tell.
[17]THE COURT: Okay. All right. Go ahead.
[18]REDIRECT EXAMINATION
[19]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) Quickly. Doctor, remember you were
[20]shown a list of physical injuries.
[21]MR. WILLIAMS: May I have the ELMO?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS: [*80]  ) And did -- the Abbott lawyer showed you
[24]a list. The one I used in direct with you had something that
[25]wasn't on his list that he showed, the patent foramen ovale,
Pg. 679
[1]correct?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. That was not on the list. Okay.
[4]Abbott's lawyers asked you about Exhibit 3459.3. Do you
[5]remember the area where they were talking about him getting
[6]around the campus on his crutches?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. And that's not in agreement with your observation, right?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. You have looked at the -- it's Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2472,
[11]Defense 4125. This is the individualized education program
[12]from May 4th -- some three weeks ago -- 2017, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. And as of about three weeks ago, to bring us up-to-date --
[15](Conferring)
[16]Q. (BY MR. WILLIAMS:) If we look at how he's doing as of
[17]three weeks ago, he wears bilateral AFOs. That's what you
[18]described, right?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. He uses both crutches and a manual wheelchair for mobility,
[21]correct?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. His manual wheelchair is equipped with the Wijits that you
[24]spoke about that multiply [*81]  the torque of his wheels, which make
[25]self-propulsion both faster and easier. He uses the crutches
Pg. 680
[1]for other modes of mobility while indoors, and his wheelchair
[2]for distance and outdoors, right?
[3]That's what their observation was?
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. And he's able to transfer from his wheelchair to a
[6]classroom chair -- or to the floor. Due to his propensity for
[7]skin openings on his lower extremities, he is not currently
[8]sitting on the floor?
[9]A. Right.
[10]Q. And from the floor or the chair back to his wheelchair. He
[11]uses his wheelchair in the cafeteria for functional seating
[12]while eating since transfer to the bench style seating is
[13]difficult. He must also use his wheelchair and not his
[14]crutches if he is not wearing his AFOs. He uses his wheelchair
[15]while in transit to the school bus, right?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. Consistent with what you observed?
[18]A. It is consistent with my review, yes.
[19]Q. And I don't know -- so this is May 4, 2017?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. Okay.
[22]MR. WILLIAMS: Thank you, your Honor. I'll pass the
[23]witness.
[24]THE COURT: All right. [*82]  Thank you.
