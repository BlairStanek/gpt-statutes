[1]where the sample comprised an agent that inhibits
[2]lysis. So the presence of an agent, if it does
[3]not inhibit lysis, doesn't meet the claims of the
[4]patent.
[5]VIDEOGRAPHER: Excuse me. We've got
[6]about ten minutes left on this media. Just
[7]letting you know.
[8]MS. MAJOR: Okay. If you can let me
[9]know when we have about two minutes left. Thank
[10]you.
[11]Q. (By Ms. Major, continuing)
[12]Doctor Van Ness, just to -- to follow up on your
[13]answer. I'm talking about an agent that does, in
[14]fact, inhibit lysis.
[15]If it is present in the sample, is kind of
[16]naturally occurring, does that meet the
[17]limitation?
[18]A. And my answer, I think, is the same. Is
[19]that -- no, because the agent has to be at a
[20]sufficient quantity to inhibit lysis.
[21]So there's a -- two requirements. Has to
[22]be an agent selected from one of those categories
[23]and it has to inhibit lysis. It has to inhibit
[24]the cellular lysis.
[25]Q. Why -- it seems like built into your
  Page 139
[1]answer to my question is the assumption that
[2]anything that naturally occurs in that sample
[3]will not be present in sufficient quantity to
[4]inhibit lysis.
[5]Is that the distinction you're making?
[6]A. I'm -- I'm not sure I -- I'm -- you're --
[7]you're -- put the global term "anything."
[8]Q. Okay.
[9]A. So I, you know -- you just opened up --
[10]universe here.
[11]So, I think within the understanding,
[12]again, of the patent and how this claim is
[13]described, that -- the -- the -- the patent --
[14]like, Claim 81 says that the "sample comprising
[15]agent that inhibits cell lysis and where the
[16]agent is selected from one of those groups."
[17]So to -- to meet that claim, both of those
[18]elements need to be met. If you have an agent in
[19]the blood, but you're not getting any cell lysis,
[20]you have not met the claim of the patent.
[21]Q. But if you have an agent in the blood that
[22]is inhibiting cell lysis, but is -- strike that.
[23]You're familiar with the exemplary
[24]reagents that are listed in the patent
[25]specification.
  Page 140
[1]Correct?
[2]For instance, of membrane stabilizers?
[3]A. I'm not -- I'm -- I'm familiar that those
[4]reagents have been listed as -- as exemplary. I
[5]am not familiar with the mechanism, structure of
[6]every one of those reagents.
[7]Q. Okay. If you could turn to the '720
[8]patent, which is Exhibit 5.
[9]A. Okay.
[10]Q. I'm looking at PDF page 45, if you're in
[11]that electronic version.
[12]A. Would you give me a column?
[13]Q. Yes. Column 6, lines 49 to 65.
[14]A. All right. I lost my pen. Okay.
[15]Column 6, 49 to 65. Okay.
[16]Q. Yes. Do you see the list there of
[17]exemplary membrane stabilizers?
[18]A. Oops, I'm on the wrong patent. Sorry.
[19]Just a minute.
[20]Q. No, that's no problem. '720.
[21]A. Yeah, '720. Make sure I've got the right
[22]one.
[23]Yeah, I was in the wrong -- I was in the
[24]wrong patent. My apologies.
[25]Okay. Column 6 -- yes, I do see the list
  Page 141
[1]of the cell lysis inhibitor. And it indicates,
[2]"is added to the sample and includes but not
[3]limited to" -- and then there's a list.
[4]Q. And if you look at the paragraph beginning
[5]at column 6, line 49, there are a number of what
[6]the patent refers to as agents that stabilize the
[7]cell membrane.
[8]Do you see, among the list of examples,
[9]there are naturally occurring compounds, such as
[10]cholesterol?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. So is the claim limitation in Claim 1 of
[13]the '720 patent, claim 81 of the '277 patent
[14]satisfied if the agent present is cholesterol,
[15]naturally occurring in the sample, and it is --
[16]there is, in fact, inhibition of cell lysis in
[17]the sample? So it meets the one criteria you
[18]keep pointing to.
[19]My question is, if the cholesterol is just
[20]naturally present in the sample at a sufficient
[21]level to inhibit cell lysis, is limitation met?
[22]A. I don't think so, because, based on the
[23]description, it indicates, as in the first
[24]sentence of 49, line 49, an agent that stabilizes
[25]cell main -- membranes may be added to the
  Page 142
[1]maternal.
[2]So the -- the -- the -- again, reading the
[3]claim in light of the specification, the
[4]specification indicates that an agent is added to
[5]the sample to prevent cell lysis. It's not the
[6]endogenous agent that -- that they are adding.
[7]And, in fact, the consequence of that is
[8]basically the invention that you have reduced
[9]maternal cell lysis by adding agents even -- if
[10]they are naturally occurring agents, you've
[11]satisfied the patent by adding a -- a -- an agent
[12]that inhibits cell lysis and reduces the
[13]contamination of the fetal percentage in the
[14]blood.
[15]Q. You would agree with me that that claim
[16]language itself does not use the word "added" or
[17]"addition."
[18]Correct?
[19]A. I would agree that the claim language
[20]doesn't use that term. It uses "comprises."
[21]But, again, reading the claim language in
[22]light of the specification, and particularly the
[23]examples given, in all of those examples, the
[24]agent is added.
[25]So one skilled in the art, reading this,
  Page 143
[1]with the entire patent in front of them, would
[2]clearly understand that the agent is added to
[3]inhibit cell lysis.
[4]VIDEOGRAPHER: Excuse me. We've got
[5]about two minutes left.
[6]MS. MAJOR: Okay. Let's go off the
[7]record.
[8]VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the
[9]record. The time now is 2:10.
[10](Recess from 2:10 p.m. to 2:23 p.m.)
[11]VIDEOGRAPHER: One moment.
[12]We are back on the record. This is the
[13]start to Media No. 4. The time is 2:23.
[14]Q. (By Ms. Major, continuing) So,
[15]Doctor Van Ness, shortly before the break we were
[16]talking about whether an agent or reagent that
[17]naturally occurs in the sample could meet the
[18]limitation.
[19]And you indicated that your view is that
[20]it could not.
[21]Do I have that right?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. And you acknowledge --
[24]A. Wait. Now -- now, can I clarify -- let me
[25]clarify that.
  Page 144
[1]Q. Yes, of course.
[2]A. Yeah.
[3]An agent that's naturally occurring
[4]certainly could meet the requirement. But in
[5]order to meet the requirement, it has to be added
[6]and it has to prevent cell lysis.
[7]So a naturally occurring agent is not
[8]eliminated from the list. It's -- it makes the
[9]list for the patent only if it is added and it
[10]prevents cell lysis.
[11]Q. But you agree with me that Claim 1 of the
[12]'720 patent and Claim 81 of the '277 patent --
[13]neither includes the word "added" to the sample.
[14]Correct?
[15]A. To one skilled in the art that's reviewing
[16]the patent and the specifications and examples,
[17]it's very obvious that this -- the reagent is
[18]added to the sample.
[19]Q. And that's your view, even though Claim 12
[20]of the '277 patent, which is again, Exhibit 4 --
[21]A. Let me -- let me get to Claim 12.
[22]Q. Sorry, one -- 112. Claim 112.
[23]A. Claim 112. Okay.
[24]Q. Let me know when you're there.
[25]A. I'm there. Okay.
  Page 145
[1]Q. So Claim 112 specifically requires the
[2]method of Claim 97 or 108, wherein an agent that
[3]inhibits cell lysis is added to the sample to
[4]inhibit the lysis of cells, and so on and so
[5]forth, consistent with the other language in the
[6]remainder of the "agent" term that we've been
[7]discussing.
[8]Do you see that?
[9]A. I do see that.
[10]Q. So it's your view that even though
[11]Claim 112 specifically says the agent "is added
[12]to," that where claims do not include that
[13]specific language, "is added to," there is still
[14]a requirement that the agent be added in order to
[15]meet the claims?
[16]A. So my view is that the claim is
[17]sufficiently clear when read in the light of the
[18]specifications of the examples, where -- where to
[19]meet Claim 1 or 81, that the sample is added,
[20]because everything points to that process, which
[21]supports the claim.
[22]Q. Okay. Looking again at Claim 1 of the
[23]'720 patent, for example.
[24]Who is required to do the selecting from
[25]the group consisting of membrane stabilizer,
  Page 146
[1]cross-linker and cell lysis inhibitor?
[2]A. Who is required?
[3]Q. Yes.
[4]A. I -- I don't -- I've read Claim 1 enough,
[5]but I probably should -- I just want to make sure
[6]it's up here.
[7]Q. Sure.
[8]A. So who is required?
[9]I presume it's the person practicing the
[10]claims of the -- of the patent. One skilled in
[11]the art.
[12]Q. Can you -- you can agree with me that
[13]selecting an agent to inhibit lysis was known
[14]before the Ravgen patents.
[15]Correct?
[16]A. I agree that a -- agent to inhibit lysis
[17]was known, but it was not known that in doing so
[18]it would significantly increase fetal DNA in the
[19]blood.
[20]Q. Is there anything unique about the
[21]Ravgen's patents claim selection of an agent to
[22]impede lysis?
[23]A. I think the uniqueness is that they
[24]delineate specifically a membrane stabilizer,
[25]cross-linker or cell lysis inhibitor.
  Page 147
[1]So there is -- it's not anything to
[2]inhibit cell lysis. It's something -- an agent
[3]from one of those categories.
[4]Q. You would agree that your declarations in
[5]this case provide your complete expert opinions
[6]on the party's disputes regarding the "agent"
[7]term.
[8]Correct?
[9]A. I would -- I think the statement is that
[10]it is accurate to the best of my abilities, with
[11]the idea -- with the -- I acknowledge that I have
[12]the right to amend.
[13]So insofar as there may be a need to
[14]amend, I've stated that I have the right to
[15]amend.
[16]Q. What, in your view, is the definition of a
[17]cell lysis inhibitor?
[18]A. I think a cell lysis inhibitor -- again,
[19]in the context of the patent, meets the
[20]requirements of -- of stabilizing the cell,
[21]maintaining a structural component of the cell to
[22]prevent the membrane from rup -- rupturing
[23]and -- and the cell breaking apart and spilling
[24]its contents.
[25]So a cell lysis -- I -- remind me. You
  Page 148
[1]wanted the definition of cell lysis inhibitor?
[2]Q. Cell lysis inhibitor --
[3]A. It's -- the cell lysis inhibitor
[4]specifically reduces, inhibits or impedes the
[5]process of structural integrity that holds that
[6]cell together. And that does meet membrane
[7]stabilizer, cross-linker, cell lysis inhibitor.
[8]Q. Sorry.
[9]So your definition of cell lysis
[10]inhibitor -- are you saying that also is the
[11]definition of membrane stabilizer,
[12]cross-linker --
[13]A. No. I'm -- I'm --
[14]Q. Sorry.
[15]A. -- saying that the membrane stabilizer and
[16]cross-linker satisfy the requirement of a cell
[17]lysis inhibitor by increasing the structural
[18]integrity of the cell, maintaining the structural
[19]integrity of the cell.
[20]Q. Okay. So you're saying the membrane
[21]stabilizer and cross-linker -- that -- terms are
[22]referred to in Claim 1 of the '720 patent, for
[23]instance.
[24]You say "satisfy the requirement of a cell
[25]lysis inhibitor."
  Page 149
[1]What do you mean by "satisfy the
[2]requirement of" -- that third category of agents
[3]that are to be selected from?
[4]A. That there -- there are agents that
[5]maintain or preserve the structural integrity of
[6]the cell. And I refer to those as cell lysis
[7]inhibitors. They increase the structural
[8]integrity of the cell so that it does not lys
[9]when faced with stress.
[10]Q. Are you saying what you understand to be
[11]membrane stabilizers are all cell lysis
[12]inhibitors, as well?
[13]A. I wouldn't argue that every mem -- every
[14]membrane stabilizer inhibits lysis. They give
[15]exemplary -- examples of those that do it. And
[16]they specifically talked about formalin.
[17]So, again, as a person of skill in the
[18]art, I'm understanding that a membrane stabilizer
[19]preserves the structure of the cell. In order to
[20]meet the claim, it has to sufficiently maintain
[21]the structure of the cell to prevent its lysis.
[22]Q. When you say, "to meet the claim it has to
[23]sufficiently maintain the structure of the cell
[24]to prevent its lysis," do you mean it must, for
[25]all time, prevent the cell from lysing?
  Page 150
[1]A. Of course not for all time. It's for
[2]the -- for the purposes of isolating cell-free
[3]DNA, as described in the specifications and the
[4]examples.
[5]So, as the examples described, when a
[6]sample is drawn, they are over a fairly short
[7]period of time. Time is an issue. But over --
[8]over a fairly short period of time cells are
[9]under stress and the membranes start degrading.
[10]The agent is required to stabilize those
[11]cells so that they don't lys within the time
[12]period required to analyze the sample, as
[13]described in the patent.
[14]Q. You would agree with me, if you look at
[15]Claim 1 of the '720 patent, that there's no
[16]mention of a time for which cell lysis must be
[17]impeded.
[18]Correct?
[19]A. In Claim 1 there's not. And in the -- in
[20]the -- in the patent it doesn't -- it isn't
[21]claiming time.
[22]But to one skilled in the art, we would
[23]all recognize that the longer cells sit, the more
[24]they start degrading.
[25]And in terms of an application, if you're
  Page 151
[1]going to use this as a diagnostic method, you
[2]have to be able to process the sample, ship the
[3]sample, and -- and -- and be able to have it
[4]preserved in order to carry out the methods of --
[5]of the patent.
[6]So I think I'm relying on my
[7]understanding, as one skilled in the art, that
[8]there is a time component to cells lysing the
[9]longer they sit. And you -- you need to stop
[10]that with the cell lysis inhibitor.
[11]Q. So to practice Claim 1 of the '720 patent,
[12]for how long does the agent have to impede cell
[13]lysis?
[14]A. That -- that time is not defined as a
[15]requirement of the patent. It is defined, in
[16]part, because of experience and -- and
[17]understanding of people with skill in the art,
[18]that there is lysis that occurs over a period of
[19]time.
[20]And, as this patent describes, the
[21]processing time can -- you can inhibit that
[22]lysis.
[23]So I am basing my understanding and
[24]opinion, in large part, on -- on my own personal
[25]experience, which is one of the components that
  Page 152
[1]allows you to understand what is being provided
[2]in the claim.
[3]Q. So I'm asking you, as a person of ordinary
[4]skill in the art, what do you understand Claim 1
[5]to require in terms of for how long cell lysis
[6]must be impeded in order to practice that claim?
[7]A. There is nothing in that claim that has a
[8]time requirement in it.
[9]Q. So if an agent is included in a sample and
[10]it impedes cell lysis for -- strike that.
[11]If an agent is included in a sample and
[12]the agent falls into one of the three categories
[13]that we've been discussing, and cell lysis is
[14]impeded for a minute, it's your view that Claim 1
[15]of the '720 patent has been practiced?
[16]A. Within the understanding of the
[17]specification that there's a processing step that
[18]is to spin down the cells and isolate the
[19]cell-free component. If you can do that in a
[20]minute, it will meet the claims. You've added
[21]the reagent, you've inhibited the cell lysis, and
[22]you spun down the cells, you collected the -- the
[23]plasma -- in a minute, if you could do it.
[24]Now, the specifications indicate there's a
[25]certain centrifugation step. And even though
  Page 153
[1]it's not a requirement on the claim, it's clear,
[2]within the examples given, that there's a
[3]processing time that -- that takes place, in
[4]terms of drawing the sample, centrifuging the
[5]sample.
[6]So I think it's understood that cells will
[7]lys over time. If you want -- if you can do it
[8]all in a minute -- sure, it works. Works in 24
[9]hours, as well.
[10]So I -- I don't think the claim requires
[11]that you do it in a minute. Nor does it
[12]necessarily require you do it in -- in any
[13]specified time. It simply says this is a method
[14]that will inhibit lysis.
[15]Q. So the only reason I'm asking about timing
[16]is because you previously answered that to meet
[17]the claim, it has to "sufficiently maintain the
[18]structure of the cell to prevent its lysis."
[19]What does "sufficiently maintain the
[20]structure of the cell to prevent its lysis" mean,
[21]in your answer?
[22]A. It means that the structural integrity of
[23]the cell has to be maintained so that when you
[24]follow the -- the methods of the -- of the patent
[25]to isolate the cell-free component, the cells
  Page 154
[1]that you're preserving with this fixative, if you
[2]will, have not lysed.
[3]And, to one skilled in the art, I think
[4]it's obvious that that -- that process is a
[5]fairly common process of processing blood samples
[6]in terms of spinning them.
[7]What was novel was the fact that you had
[8]this lysis inhibitor so that you didn't get the
[9]lysis to contaminate the cell-free component.
[10]Q. So what is -- focusing again just on
[11]the -- the claim term "cell lysis inhibiter" --
[12]so one of the three categories.
[13]What is the well-understood definition of
[14]"cell lysis inhibitor," in your opinion, as one
[15]of skill in the art?
[16]A. In my opinion and my understanding -- my
[17]personal opinion is that a cell lysis inhibitor
[18]is an agent that preserves the structure of a
[19]cell so that it doesn't spill its contents.
[20]Q. And that's your understanding, based on
[21]your reading of the term claim -- or excuse
[22]me -- cell lysis inhibitor in the context of the
[23]claims, the specifications and the intrinsic
[24]record.
[25]Do I have that right?
  Page 155
[1]A. And my experience. So I -- I would -- I
[2]would add that.
[3]All of those components informed me
[4]what -- how the "cell lysis inhibitor" term was
[5]being used.
[6]Q. But at the time of the alleged inventions
[7]in the Ravgen patents, cell lysis inhibitor was
[8]not a term of art known to persons of ordinary
[9]skill.
[10]Correct?
[11]A. I don't think that is correct. I think
[12]cell lysis inhibitor is a -- has some plain,
[13]ordinary meaning to people in the field. So
[14]I -- I guess I would not agree that people would
[15]be confused by that term.
[16]It's a -- it's a -- pretty well
[17]descriptive, understood term. And -- and it has
[18]been used in -- in various contexts.
[19]Q. Well, the Ravgen patents don't define
[20]"cell lysis inhibitor." Correct?
[21]A. Precisely. And that is because it was
[22]well understood. It didn't -- it -- it had
[23]plain, ordinary meaning. And I didn't think that
[24]there needed to be a specific dictionary
[25]definition of the cell lysis inhibitor, because
  Page 156
[1]those skilled in the art knew exactly what it
[2]was.
[3]Q. Well, the Ravgen patents don't identify a
[4]single scientific publication that uses the term
[5]"cell lysis inhibiter."
[6]Do they?
[7]A. They do not.
[8]But, again, I would defer and say, they
[9]didn't feel and I don't feel it was necessary to
[10]quote a paper that used that term if it was well
[11]understood by those skilled in the art.
[12]Q. But if no scientific publications are
[13]using the term "cell lysis inhibiter," doesn't
[14]that call into question whether it is a term well
[15]understood in the art?
[16]A. I -- I don't think so, because it is a
[17]functional description. And -- and, as I point
[18]out, it has been used in -- in -- in -- in the
[19]art. It has been used in the art.
[20]Q. Well, it -- let -- let's talk about that.
[21]So your expert declarations don't identify
[22]any dictionary that identifies and defines the
[23]term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[24]Correct?
[25]A. I did not identify any dictionary
  Page 157
[1]definition.
[2]Q. And your expert declarations don't
[3]identify any scientific publication that used the
[4]term "cell lysis inhibiter" as of the time of the
[5]Ravgen patents.
[6]Correct?
[7]A. As of the time of the Ravgen patents there
[8]are patents that -- that do use that term.
[9]Again, they -- they may have been a little
[10]later than 2001. I mean, there --
[11]Q. So they --
[12]A. -- wasn't -- there wasn't this -- this
[13]sudden enlightenment that understanding what a
[14]cell lysis inhibitor in 2010 suddenly was -- we
[15]became aware -- and we didn't know what it was in
[16]2001.
[17]So I -- again, I would argue, it's simply
[18]based on what was asked of me for my opinion and
[19]my understanding, is that the term "cell lysis
[20]inhibiter" is well understood, even in 2001.
[21]Q. You testified earlier that you've reviewed
[22]Doctor Grody's expert declarations in the Natera
[23]and PerkinElmer cases.
[24]Correct?
[25]A. Correct.
  Page 158
[1]Q. And you also reviewed his deposition
[2]transcript. Correct?
[3]A. I did -- I -- yes, I did.
[4]Q. What are the primary differences between
[5]your qualifications and Doctor Grody's
[6]qualifications?
[7]A. I can't answer that. I -- I
[8]don't have -- I mean, I -- I don't -- I didn't
[9]memorize his qualifications and I don't have his
[10]CV in front of me. So I -- I -- I apologize. I
[11]don't -- I don't have a comparison of those
[12]qualifications.
[13]Q. There was anything in Doctor Grody's
[14]declarations or deposition testimony with which
[15]you disagreed?
[16]A. Not that I am a aware of right now, no.
[17]I -- I'm not aware of any disagreement.
[18]Q. Well, Doctor Grody didn't identify any
[19]dictionary that defines "cell lysis inhibitor."
[20]Correct?
[21]A. Correct. He -- yes. He -- he didn't.
[22]Nor did I. Correct.
[23]Q. And Doctor Grody did not identify any
[24]scientific publication using the term "cell lysis
[25]inhibiter."
  Page 159
[1]Correct?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]I don't disagree with his -- his
[4]declaration that he looked -- he did not cite to
[5]a specific publication. So yeah, I -- I -- that
[6]didn't -- that's not a disagreement with his
[7]declaration. It's simply an acknowledgment that
[8]he did not cite to a publication.
[9]Q. And setting aside the asserted patents,
[10]Doctor Grody didn't identify any patent using the
[11]term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[12]Correct?
[13]A. He did not. Nor am I entirely clear
[14]whether he was asked to redo all the patent
[15]histories to -- to find such a term. So the fact
[16]that he didn't cite it doesn't mean it doesn't
[17]exist.
[18]Q. But you're not aware of any patent at the
[19]time or prior to the alleged priority date of the
[20]Ravgen patents that used the -- the term "cell
[21]lysis inhibiter."
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I did cite to several patents. And I must
[24]admit I forget what their priority dates were.
[25]As I recall, I think the priority dates were
  Page 160
[1]after 2001, but I -- I -- I would beg to amend
[2]that date consideration until I confirm
[3]that -- that the Rabinowitz, Vigneault and Lee
[4]patents that I referred to -- I don't recall
[5]their priority dates.
[6]Q. Okay. Well, we'll get to those, but let's
[7]focus now on Ravgen's claim construction briefs
[8]in this matter.
[9]You would agree Ravgen's claim
[10]construction briefs don't identify any dictionary
[11]that defined "cell lysis inhibitor."
[12]Correct?
[13]A. It does not. But, again, they -- they
[14]claim -- in the claim construction they claim
[15]that as a plain and ordinary meaning.
[16]Q. And Ravgen's claim construction briefs
[17]don't identify any scientific publication that
[18]uses the term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[19]Correct?
[20]A. Correct. But I don't find it a -- an
[21]issue of confusion.
[22]Q. And setting aside the asserted patents,
[23]Ravgen's claim construction briefs don't identify
[24]any patent in existence as of the alleged
[25]priority date of the Ravgen patents that uses the
  Page 161
[1]term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[2]Correct?
[3]A. As far as I know. But, again, I don't
[4]find that a source of confusion.
[5]Q. But, again, no patent prior to the date of
[6]the Ravgen patents that ever used the term "cell
[7]lysis inhibiter," as far as you're aware.
[8]Correct?
[9]A. As far as I am aware. I have not done an
[10]exhaustive search. I didn't feel the need to do
[11]an exhaustive search, because I knew what "cell
[12]lysis inhibitor" was. That...
[13]Q. Well, in your declaration you cite to a
[14]technical dictionary definition of "cell lysis."
[15]Correct?
[16]And if -- if you want to take a look, it's
[17]paragraph 41 of Exhibit 1.
[18]A. Paragraph 41. Correct?
[19]Q. Yes.
[20]A. This was an agreement with Doctor Grody,
[21]that "cell lysis" means rupture of cell membrane
[22]and loss of cytoplasm.
[23]Correct.
[24]Q. Now, to be clear, "cell lysis" is a
[25]different term from "cell lysis inhibitor."
  Page 162
[1]Correct?
[2]A. It has a different meaning.
[3]Q. "Cell lysis" is the phenomenon of the
[4]rupture of cell membranes and loss of cytoplasm.
[5]Correct?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. And that's different from a cell lysis
[8]inhibitor. Right?
[9]A. Within the context of my understanding and
[10]the patent -- that they are distinct. There --
[11]there's a functional relationship, but the terms
[12]are just distinct terms.
[13]Q. And the 2002 Concise Dictionary of
[14]Biomedicine and Molecular Bio -- Biology that you
[15]cite in paragraph 41 of your opening claim
[16]construction declaration does not include a
[17]definition for "cell lysis inhibitor."
[18]Correct?
[19]A. It does not. But that doesn't -- but its
[20]absence doesn't mean that it's a term that is a
[21]source of confusion without that dictionary's
[22]definition.
[23]Again, citing to the specifications and
[24]how -- how all of this is described in the
[25]patent -- is very clear what a cell lysis
  Page 163
[1]inhibitor is in the context of the patent and the
[2]claims that use it.
[3]Q. Who first coined the term "cell lysis
[4]inhibiter"?
[5]A. I have no idea.
[6]Q. Now, in forming the opinions set forth in
[7]your declaration, you considered the prosecution
[8]histories of the asserted patents.
[9]Correct?
[10]A. There were certain sections of the
[11]prosecution history that I did consider.
[12]Correct.
[13]Q. And the prosecution histories of the
[14]Ravgen asserted patents don't identify any
[15]dictionary that defines "cell lysis inhibitor."
[16]Correct?
[17]A. I don't have access and didn't read the
[18]entire prosecution history, so, of what I
[19]reviewed, I did not see that definition. That
[20]doesn't mean it wasn't provided in other parts
[21]that I did not review.
[22]Q. But you, I believe, testified earlier that
[23]you understood counsel provided you all the
[24]relevant sections pertaining to terms in dispute
[25]in the class action.
  Page 164
[1]Is that right?
[2]A. They provide -- it is correct, they
[3]provided me with relevant sections in the
[4]prosecution history that they -- that related to
[5]claim construction.
[6]Q. And you would -- you would presume that if
[7]there were some portion of the prosecution
[8]history that offered an expressed definition for
[9]cell lysis inhibitor, that that would have been
[10]provided to you, as relevant to claim
[11]construction issues.
[12]Correct?
[13]A. I don't want to presume anything. I --
[14]there -- everybody has different motives for what
[15]they are providing and -- and that.
[16]So I don't -- I can't presume knowledge
[17]about material I didn't see.
[18]Q. But, as far as you're aware, nothing in
[19]the prosecution histories of the Ravgen patents
[20]identify any dictionary that defines "cell lysis
[21]inhibitor."
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I have not reviewed the entire history, so
[24]I can't answer that question.
[25]Q. Let me -- let me repeat it.
  Page 165
[1]As far as you're aware, the prosecution
[2]histories of the Ravgen patents don't identify
[3]any dictionary that defines "cell lysis
[4]inhibitor."
[5]Correct?
[6]A. As far as I'm aware, of the material that
[7]I reviewed, the "cell lysis inhibitor" did not
[8]have a specific definition.
[9]Q. And, as far as you're aware, the
[10]prosecution histories of the Ravgen patents don't
[11]identify any scientific publication using the
[12]term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[13]Correct?
[14]A. As far as I'm aware, based on what I
[15]reviewed, I did not see a publication cited in
[16]what I reviewed that used the term "cell lysis
[17]inhibiter."
[18]Q. And setting --
[19]A. Could I -- could I --
[20]Q. Sorry. Go ahead.
[21]A. Could I clarify that a minute?
[22]Yeah, that --
[23]Q. Yes.
[24]A. I -- I'll stay by -- I'll -- I'll stick
[25]with that -- that statement. That's fine.
  Page 166
[1]Q. Okay. And setting aside the asserted
[2]patents themselves, the prosecution histories of
[3]the Ravgen patents don't identify any patent
[4]using the term "cell lysis inhibiter" so far as
[5]you're aware.
[6]Correct?
[7]A. I did not read anything in the prosecution
[8]history that cited a patent that defines "cell
[9]lysis inhibitor."
[10]Q. Now, you state in your initial declaration
[11]that cell lysis inhibitor is a known and well-
[12]defined category of chemical substances.
[13]Correct?
[14]A. I would -- I would clarify that a little
[15]bit by saying in -- in -- within the context of
[16]the patent there is a description of cell lysis
[17]inhibitors of particular categories. And there
[18]were examples in those categories that were
[19]known.
[20]Q. When you say there -- strike that.
[21]When you say, "in the context of the
[22]patent there is a description of cell lysis
[23]inhibitors of particular categories," what do you
[24]mean by "particular categories"?
[25]A. Claim 1 says that the agent -- that is,
  Page 167
[1]the cell lysis inhibitor -- that the agent -- I'm
[2]sorry.
[3]Restate that.
[4]In Claim 1 it is stated that "An agent
[5]that impedes cell lysis is an agent that is
[6]selected from" -- three categories -- "membrane
[7]stabilizer, cross-linker, cell lysis inhibitor."
[8]Q. Right.
[9]And so in your prior answer, where you
[10]said, "in the context of the patent there is a
[11]description of cell lysis inhibitors of
[12]particular categories," were you using "cell
[13]lysis inhibitors" con -- interchangeably with
[14]"agents that impede cell lysis"?
[15]A. I think the answer would be yes, in the
[16]reading of the claim, an agent that impedes cell
[17]lysis is selected from one of the categories
[18]that -- the three categories list -- that are
[19]listed.
[20]Q. If you look at Claim 1 of the '720 patent.
[21]A. I have it. I...
[22]Q. What, in your view, is the difference
[23]between an agent that impedes cell lysis and cell
[24]lysis inhibitor?
[25]A. Cell lysis inhibitor is one of those three
  Page 168
[1]categories that needs the -- that meets the
[2]requirement of an agent that impedes cell lysis.
[3]Q. But how -- how is cell lysis inhibitor
[4]distinct from agents that impede cell lysis?
[5]A. It's the -- the cell lysis inhibitor is
[6]one of the three categories that -- that's --
[7]meet the requirement of an agent that impedes
[8]cell lysis.
[9]So I am saying that they are equivalent.
[10]An agent that impedes cell lysis, if it's
[11]selected from one of those categories -- and one
[12]of those categories is a cell lysis inhibitor --
[13]that is, an agent -- a cell lysis inhibitor is an
[14]agent that impedes cell lysis.
[15]I think the -- think the -- there's
[16]a -- there's a clear meaning from that, as I
[17]understand it.
[18]Q. All right. And I'm trying to get to that
[19]understanding, because I -- I am -- I am a little
[20]puzzled.
[21]So is there any agent that impedes cell
[22]lysis that is not a cell lysis inhibitor?
[23]A. It -- let me -- let me, actually, just
[24]rephrase your question.
[25]Is there an agent that impedes cell lysis
  Page 169
[1]that is not a cell lysis inhibitor?
[2]Yeah.
[3]Q. What --
[4]A. That -- that was a yes/no question, so I
[5]gave you -- I -- I gave you a yes answer.
[6]Q. No, that's fine. I'm happy to follow up.
[7]A. Okay.
[8]Q. What is an example of an agent that
[9]impedes cell lysis that, in your view, is not a
[10]cell lysis inhibitor?
[11]A. EDTA. We're there. EDTA impedes cell
[12]lysis, but it's not a cell lysis inhibitor.
[13]Q. Why is it not a cell lysis inhibitor?
[14]A. Because EDTA does not meet the requirement
[15]of stabilizing, fixing the structural components
[16]of the cell.
[17]EDTA is an anticoagulant that blocks the
[18]stress that causes cell lysis.
[19]So EDTA does not break -- stop the cells
[20]from breaking down membranes and rupturing. It
[21]stops coagulation that is a stress that induces
[22]cell lysis.
[23]So it's not an anti -- it is not a cell
[24]lysis inhibitor. It's an anticoagulant.
[25]In addition, I'm informed by that -- not
  Page 170
[1]only by the -- the specifications, but I'm
[2]informed by that, by the prosecution history,
[3]where the examiner and the patentee both had that
[4]discussion and both agreed and specifically
[5]pointed to the fact that EDTA is not, in this
[6]patent, to be considered a cell lysis inhibitor.
[7]So one reading the claims in the patent
[8]would understand, based on the intrinsic
[9]evidence, and the fact that EDTA is an
[10]anticoagulant to prevent stress, much like
[11]centrifugation, narrow-bore needles, it is not an
[12]inhibitor of coagulation, does not meet the
[13]definition of a cell lysis inhibitor. The patent
[14]examiner and the patentee came to that agreement.
[15]Q. Besides EDTA, are you aware of any agents
[16]that impede cell lysis that are not themselves
[17]cell lysis inhibitors?
[18]A. Oh, probably EGTA.
[19]Other agents...
[20]Off the top of my head, I -- I can't think
[21]of another one, but I think EDTA is a good
[22]example of -- impedes lysis, but is not a cell
[23]lysis inhibitor.
[24]Q. And, just to make sure I'm clear, you're
[25]saying because EDTA stops coagulation,
  Page 171
[1]coagulation being the thing that causes stress
[2]that induces cell lysis, it is not considered a
[3]cell lysis inhibitor, because it's not, itself,
[4]preventing -- well --
[5]A. I'll -- I'll fix -- if I may finish your
[6]sentence -- I agree with everything you said.
[7]Q. Yes.
[8]A. It's not preventing the struct --
[9]structural degradation of the cell itself, an
[10]issue to which I understand, as well as the
[11]patentee and the examiner understood.
[12]Q. So a cell lysis inhibitor has to, itself,
[13]prevent the structural degradation of the cell?
[14]A. That is my understanding.
[15]Q. Do I have that right?
[16]A. That is my understanding.
[17]Q. So what chemical substances fall within
[18]the category "cell lysis inhibitor"?
[19]A. They are listed in -- we -- we reviewed
[20]one of the columns. Column 6, I think it was.
[21]That provides a list of compounds that are cell
[22]lysis inhibitors.
[23]Q. Can you identify any compound not
[24]expressly listed in the specification of the
[25]Ravgen patents that is considered a cell lysis
  Page 172
[1]inhibitor?
[2]A. I wasn't asked to do that. I -- that
[3]wasn't part of what my charge was, as to identify
[4]compounds that weren't in the patent.
[5]So no, I don't -- I don't have any
[6]additional compounds to add to that list. Wasn't
[7]something I was asked to investigate.
[8]Q. Do you know if there are any additional
[9]compounds, beyond what's listed in the
[10]specification of the patent, that would be
[11]considered a cell lysis inhibitor, to your
[12]understanding?
[13]A. I don't know. I didn't investigate that.
[14]Q. What chemical substances fall outside of
[15]the category of cell lysis inhibitors, as you
[16]understand that term?
[17]A. What substances?
[18]You want me to list some things
[19]that -- well, EDTA -- and forgive me, but we can
[20]go down an entire chemical list of things that
[21]don't prevent cell lysis. I mean, sodium
[22]chloride, sodium iodide, magnesium chloride -- I
[23]mean, there's a whole list of chemicals that
[24]don't prevent cell lysis.
[25]So there's -- there's a large list that
  Page 173
[1]I -- I could choose all day long -- chemicals
[2]that -- that do not likely in -- inhibit cell
[3]lysis.
[4]So I -- I named a few, but I -- I could go
[5]down the -- the shelf of my laboratory and pick
[6]lots of chemicals that don't impede or don't stop
[7]cell lysis.
[8]Q. You would agree that substances that don't
[9]qualify as cell lysis inhibitors are never
[10]explained within the specification of the Ravgen
[11]patents.
[12]Correct?
[13]A. Could you say that again? I -- I want to
[14]make sure I'm clear on --
[15]Q. Sure.
[16]A. -- on your question.
[17]Q. You would agree that substances that don't
[18]qualify as cell lysis inhibitors are never
[19]explained in the specification of the Ravgen
[20]patents.
[21]Correct?
[22]A. I would guess that's correct, because I
[23]don't know why you would name all the things that
[24]don't meet the requirements of the patent.
[25]Q. Well, can you point to any portion of the
  Page 174
[1]specification that does explain what cell lysis
[2]inhibitor -- what that category is?
[3]A. I think, as you read it, it -- and, again,
[4]in column -- should we go to column 6?
[5]I think that was the column we -- we went
[6]to before.
[7]Q. In the '720 patent, I believe.
[8]A. I think it was -- was it? Was that not
[9]the one we went to before, where there was the
[10]list of compounds?
[11]Q. Yes, column 6, in the '720 patent.
[12]A. Okay. So now could you repeat your
[13]question one more time, now that I have the
[14]context of this in front of me?
[15]Q. Sure.
[16]Can you point to any portion of the patent
[17]specification that provides any explanation as to
[18]what a cell lysis inhibitor is?
[19]A. At line 46.
[20]"An agent that stabilizes cell membranes
[21]may be added to a maternal blood samples to
[22]reduce maternal cell lysis."
[23]So they are referring to stabilizing the
[24]cell membrane. It -- it reduces cell lysis. And
[25]they provide examples of compounds that do that.
  Page 175
[1]So I think -- to one skilled in the art, I
[2]think it's understood that -- that these are --
[3]are things that inhibit cell lysis.
[4]They also refer to formalin, which is well
[5]known as a cross-linker. The mechanism of
[6]cross-linking is well known to people in the art.
[7]Ravgen didn't discover it, but they
[8]utilized it in a novel way that -- well known in
[9]the art that formalin cross-links proteins in a
[10]membrane and fulfills the requirements of a
[11]membrane stabilizer and struct -- and maintaining
[12]the structural integrity of the cell to reduce
[13]lysis.
[14]Q. How does a cell lysis inhibitor differ, if
[15]at all, from a membrane stabilizer?
[16]A. Kind of a pickles-and-cucumbers argument
[17]again. And that is that a membrane stabilizer is
[18]one type of cell lysis inhibitor. And I think
[19]they wanted to be -- the patent wanted to be
[20]inclusive of categories that -- agents that
[21]created a structural support to stop the cell
[22]from rupturing. So a membrane stabilizer
[23]is -- or a cross-linker is one way to achieve
[24]that.
[25]Q. And -- sorry.
  Page 176
[1]You just referenced cross-linker, but my
[2]question was about the difference, if any,
[3]between membrane stabilizer and cell lysis
[4]inhibitor.
[5]A. Right.
[6]So a membrane stabilizer is a -- an agent
[7]that I would understand is a cell lysis -- can be
[8]a cell lysis inhibitor, if it meets the
[9]requirements of preventing cell lysis.
[10]The reason I think the term "cell lysis
[11]inhibiter" was added is because there are
[12]examples of things that do -- that don't
[13]necessarily cross-link proteins, for example, to
[14]stabilize the membrane.
[15]Q. Are you using "cross-linker"
[16]interchangeably with "membrane stabilizer"?
[17]A. Could. Because a cross-linker does have
[18]the capability of stabilizing a membrane.
[19]Q. So if you look at the list of the three
[20]categories in the claim --
[21]A. Uh-huh.
[22]Q. -- how, if at all, does one category
[23]differ from another?
[24]It sounds like you're using them
[25]interchangeably.
  Page 177
[1]A. I think -- "interchangeably" isn't maybe
[2]the way I would describe it.
[3]I would probably say there is overlap;
[4]that is, formalin is a membrane stabilizer and it
[5]is a cross-linker. So there's overlap.
[6]And I don't think that the listing
[7]indicated that those categories were mutually
[8]exclusive from each other. There's nothing in
[9]the patent that said each category is mutually
[10]exclusive from another.
[11]And, in fact, a person of skill in the art
[12]would recognize formalin as an example of a
[13]stabilizer and a cross-linker.
[14]Q. And you would agree that patent
[15]specifications also refers to it as a cell lysis
[16]inhibitor.
[17]Correct?
[18]A. Correct. It can -- it -- it's meeting the
[19]requirements of the categories.
[20]Q. By meeting all three, apparently?
[21]A. You can meet --
[22]Q. Is that your testimony?
[23]A. Any one or all three works -- works.
[24]Q. So, sitting here today, it's your
[25]testimony that what exactly was the definition of
  Page 178
[1]"cell lysis inhibitor" that was known at the time
[2]of the alleged invention in the Ravgen patents?
[3]A. I provided that answer, but I -- I will
[4]try to do it again in the hope that I get the
[5]same words in the same order.
[6]And that is that -- my understanding at
[7]the time of the invention, that a cell lysis
[8]inhibitor was understood to be an agent that
[9]acted by structurally -- by -- by taking
[10]structural integrity in a cell to prevent it from
[11]lysing.
[12]Q. So it's your understanding cell lysis
[13]inhibitors really depended on acting to improve
[14]or support the structural integrity of the cell?
[15]Is that the -- the critical part of what a
[16]cell lysis inhibitor does?
[17]A. Cell lysis inhibitor preserves the
[18]structural integrity of the cell -- insofar as I
[19]think that's pretty close to an agreement to what
[20]you said, but I wanted to make sure that I -- I
[21]was clear on that.
[22]Q. Okay. Okay. Well, in your reply
[23]declaration, which we've marked as Exhibit 2, if
[24]you need to look at it for any reason -- but
[25]you've, again, offered the opinion that "cell
  Page 179
[1]lysis inhibitor" was a well-understood term.
[2]Correct?
[3]A. Again, correct, based on skill in the art
[4]and reading the patent and specifications,
[5]examples, prosecution history. All of those
[6]components, to me, in my opinion, made the
[7]understanding of cell lysis inhibitor apparent
[8]and clear.
[9]Q. And that you specifically point to third-
[10]party patents that you say support your opinion
[11]that cell lysis inhibitor was well understood.
[12]Correct?
[13]A. I do point to some patents that -- that
[14]use that term in their specifications. And I
[15]think the Rabinowitz patent actually has it in
[16]one of their claim constructions. That term is
[17]used --
[18]Q. How did you -- sorry to interrupt.
[19]A. Go ahead.
[20]Q. How did you go about identifying the
[21]patents discussed in your reply declaration?
[22]A. I asked for help from counsel to identify
[23]places where a cell lysis inhibitor may be used.
[24]And we undertook a search to -- to find those.
[25]Counsel provided those patents to me.
  Page 180
[1]Q. Do you know what sources were searched to
[2]find the patents you have cited to in your
[3]declaration?
[4]A. I'm sure it was the U.S. Patent Office,
[5]but in terms of how they -- they did a word
[6]search on that, I -- I don't know.
[7]Q. All right. And if you want to take a look
[8]at the portion of your reply declaration, I'm
[9]referencing -- it's paragraph 62 of your reply
[10]declaration, which was Exhibit 2, if you want to
[11]look at the electronic version.
[12]A. I am -- I just want to make sure I'm in
[13]the right place here. I've got Exhibit 2 and
[14]paragraph 62. Okay. Okay.
[15]Q. Okay.
[16]A. Do -- should it be useful if I read this
[17]paragraph first, before we discuss it? I mean,
[18]I've read it, but I'd like to review it --
[19]Q. Sure.
[20]A. -- if you want to discuss it.
[21]Q. Yeah, you're welcome to review it.
[22]My question is just, paragraph 62 is where
[23]you point to certain third-party patents that you
[24]say support --
[25]A. Oh, okay.
  Page 181
[1]Q. -- support your opinion that "cell lysis
[2]inhibitor" is a well-understood term in the art.
[3]Correct?
[4]A. Yeah, there were third-party patents
[5]that -- that supported my contention that "cell
[6]lysis inhibitor" was used and did not require
[7]specific definitions and it was understood.
[8]Q. Okay. And then you list two patents and
[9]one published patent application. Correct?
[10]A. I think that's correct. I -- I -- I
[11]recognize -- for reasons I -- for reasons I can't
[12]give you -- I'm terrible remembering names, but I
[13]actually remember these -- Rabinowitz, Vigneault
[14]and Lee patents. That's how I identify it. But
[15]those are -- those are the patents included
[16]there.
[17]Q. I see.
[18]Well, let's look at the patents. So let's
[19]mark Tab 12 -- I'm sorry -- Tab 13 as Exhibit 6.
[20]CONCIERGE: Okay.
[21](Deposition Exhibit No. 6 marked.)
[22]CONCIERGE: Exhibit 6 should be in
[23]your folder, if you refresh.
[24]A. (Continuing) I'm getting -- is it loading
[25]or -- I got a blank page. Let me -- let me go
  Page 182
[1]back and try it again. Just...
[2]No, I just get a gray page.
[3]Open, there it is.
[4]CONCIERGE: Okay.
[5]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[6]Q. (By Ms. Major, continuing) All right.
[7]So --
[8]A. This is -- okay.
[9]Q. So you recognize Exhibit 6 as U.S. Patent
[10]10,392,614?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. And that is what you are referring to as
[13]the Vigneault --
[14]A. Vigneault -- however you pronounce it.
[15]Q. Vigneault?
[16]A. Yes. Correct.
[17]Q. All right. Now, the '614 patent was filed
[18]on September 29, 2017. Correct?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. And the earliest provisional application
[21]relied on by the '614 patent was filed on
[22]March 15, 2013.
[23]Do you see that?
[24]A. I do see that.
[25]Q. And you understand that in claim
  Page 183
[1]construction we're concerned with the meaning of
[2]terms as understood by a person of ordinary skill
[3]in the art at the effective filing date of the
[4]patent.
[5]Correct?
[6]A. I understand that.
[7]Q. So for claim construction for the Ravgen
[8]patents, the focus is on a person of ordinary
[9]skill in the art at the time of the invention of
[10]the '277 and the '720 patents.
[11]Right?
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. And, as we discussed previously, your
[14]understanding, based on your review of Ravgen
[15]documents, is that the relevant time is
[16]December 28, 2001.
[17]Do I have that right?
[18]A. That's correct.
[19]Q. And the earliest potential filing date of
[20]the '614 patent that's been marked as Exhibit 6,
[21]and that you point to in your declaration, was
[22]over 12 years after the alleged invention of
[23]Ravgen's patents.
[24]Correct?
[25]A. Correct.
  Page 184
[1]Q. So you understand that the '614 patent is
[2]not relevant to construction of terms in the
[3]Ravgen patents.
[4]Right?
[5]A. In terms of a timing issue. But the use
[6]of that term -- I -- I do think the question you
[7]asked me was, is there any published work that --
[8]that uses that term. This is an example of that.
[9]If you now ask me, is there a published
[10]term that uses that work prior to or
[11]contemporaneous with the patent application, this
[12]does not fulfill that.
[13]That doesn't change my opinion that a
[14]person of skill in the art would understand the
[15]use of cell lysis inhibitor in this context and
[16]it would understand the use of the words "cell
[17]lysis inhibitor" in the Ravgen 2001 time frame.
[18]It doesn't change my opinion that that
[19]term is not a confusing term in light of all of
[20]the components of the patent.
[21]Q. But, just to be clear, are you relying on
[22]this later '614 patent in support of your
[23]opinions on claim construction of the Ravgen
[24]patents?
[25]A. I am not relying on this patent to make
  Page 185
[1]that -- that claim. I'm relying on my
[2]understanding in reading the patent and my
[3]understanding of skill in the art, that I find
[4]that in 2001 the term "cell lysis inhibiter" was
[5]not a confusing term.
[6]Q. And you would agree that a person of
[7]ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
[8]alleged invention of Ravgen's patents would never
[9]have known about the '614 patent that you point
[10]to in your declaration.
[11]Correct?
[12]A. That is correct. But, again, as I point
[13]out, I'm not relying on this to support my
[14]opinion that the term is -- is -- is known.
[15]Q. But the '614 patent doesn't tell us
[16]anything about the knowledge of a person of skill
[17]in the art at the time of the alleged invention
[18]of Ravgen's patents.
[19]Correct?
[20]A. Correct. But it does not change my
[21]opinion.
[22]Q. And the '614 patent doesn't demonstrate
[23]that the term "cell lysis inhibiter" was used by
[24]persons of skill in the art at the time of the
[25]alleged invention of Ravgen's patents.
  Page 186
[1]Correct?
[2]A. It doesn't deny that possibility. That
[3]is, it doesn't say people didn't use that term.
[4]It's just simply saying, we're using the term in
[5]2013, 12 years after.
[6]But it doesn't -- it doesn't specifically,
[7]anywhere in this patent, say, "Oh, nobody used
[8]it" and "Nor is my opinion that this patent
[9]supports a contention that that term was never
[10]used in 2001."
[11]Quite the opposite. That term was easily
[12]understood.
[13]Q. But the '614 patent doesn't provide
[14]evidence that it was a term in use in the
[15]December 2001 time frame.
[16]Correct?
[17]A. It does not provide evidence that it was.
[18]Nor does it provide evidence that it was not.
[19]Q. Now, you also point to U.S. Patent
[20]No. 9,404,150 as another third-party patent that
[21]used the term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[22]Correct?
[23]A. Which one -- which -- can we -- should we
[24]bring that up? I mean, it's cited. And if it's
[25]cited --
  Page 187
[1]Q. Sure.
[2]A. I mean, if it's cited --
[3]Multiple voices.)
[4]A. (Continuing) -- I -- I agree.
[5]Q. Yes.
[6]MS. MAJOR: And we can mark that as
[7]Tab 14. Should be marked as Exhibit 7.
[8]CONCIERGE: Marking right now.
[9](Deposition Exhibit No. 7 marked.)
[10]CONCIERGE: Exhibit 7 should be in
[11]your folder, if you refresh.
[12]A. (Continuing) Okay. This is the Lee
[13]publication. I mean, the Lee patent. Published
[14]patent. Okay.
[15]Q. All right. And so Exhibit 7, which I'll
[16]refer to as the '150 patent, was filed on
[17]August 28, 2008.
[18]Correct?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. And the earliest provisional application
[21]relied on by the 150 patent was filed on
[22]August 29, 2007.
[23]Right?
[24]A. Wait a minute. I'm missing that date.
[25]Where -- where is that date?
  Page 188
[1]I see March 12, 2009.
[2]Q. So if you go a little farther down,
[3]under -- or next to the 60 that's in
[4]parentheses -- application number?
[5]A. I -- I'm seeing 50 -- oh, 60, there.
[6]Q. Yeah.
[7]A. Provisional application -- yep, got it --
[8]2007. Correct.
[9]Q. Okay. So the earliest potential filing
[10]date of the '150 patent that you point to in your
[11]declaration was over five years after the alleged
[12]invention of Ravgen's patents.
[13]Correct?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. And so you understand that the '150 patent
[16]is not relevant to assessing how to construe the
[17]term in the Ravgen patents.
[18]Correct?
[19]A. I -- I would clarify this, that the use of
[20]the term "cell lysis inhibiter" in this patent
[21]wasn't a novel term they made up on August 29,
[22]2007.
[23]So, in other words, to say that that term
[24]was used in 2007 puts that as its date that it
[25]was known, I think, is kind of silly.
  Page 189
[1]They certainly knew the term before they
[2]wrote the patent. They -- and so how long before
[3]the patent? I don't have an idea.
[4]But I certainly wouldn't restrict the
[5]patent, as that term was only known as -- as of
[6]2007, because they wouldn't have made up that
[7]term on the spot in 2007.
[8]They would have understood that term prior
[9]to the filing of the patent and using the
[10]language they were using.
[11]So I think it does support, for me, that
[12]the term "cell lysis inhibiter" was -- was known.
[13]I can't argue that this proves it was
[14]known in 2001, but I do think it -- it
[15]demonstrates that it was known, I would argue,
[16]well before 2007.
[17]And it doesn't change my opinion that a
[18]person of skill in the art would understand the
[19]term "cell lysis inhibitor" is an agent that
[20]prevents cell lysis.
[21]So I -- again, my opinion is, I'm not
[22]dependent on this patent, that my understanding
[23]of the term is not dependent on this patent, and
[24]I don't find any ambiguity or reason to question
[25]what the definition of that term is in 2001.
  Page 198
[1]cross-linker"?
[2]A. I think that that statement would -- would
[3]hold water. It may be a little bit less
[4]inclusive than adding the term "cell lysis
[5]inhibiter," because adding the term "cell lysis
[6]inhibiter" allows that there are reagents
[7]that -- that may fall out of those categories.
[8]So I think it would be -- it wouldn't
[9]change my understanding, but I do think, by
[10]adding all three components, it adds clarity and
[11]comprehensiveness to the breadth of the claim --
[12]I'm sorry, let's use the legal term -- to the
[13]scope of the claim.
[14]Q. Can you identify any cell lysis inhibitor,
[15]as you understand that term, that does not fall
[16]within the category membrane stabilizer or
[17]cross-linker?
[18]A. I'll -- I'll give you one example,
[19]but -- but I also want to comment that it wasn't
[20]my charge to identify all of the mechanisms of
[21]actions of all of those compounds.
[22]I accept the fact that there are compounds
[23]that represent those categories. Some of those
[24]compounds overlap. Some of them may be distinct.
[25]I didn't go through every compound.
  Page 199
[1]But if you take a compound, like
[2]Vitamin E, it's an antioxidant. And so it -- it
[3]actually stabilizes the health of the cell by
[4]reducing oxidation events which pre -- helps
[5]preserve the structural integrity of the cell.
[6]I don't think it works by cross-linking.
[7]And the extent to which it -- it maintains a
[8]structural integrity of -- of a membrane
[9]stabilizer -- I'm not so sure.
[10]But its mechanism is more of an
[11]antioxidant that -- that basically gives you a
[12]healthy cell.
[13]One of the things that happens when cells
[14]are stressed is, they generate these reactive
[15]oxygen species. And that leads to a whole series
[16]of events that result in a rupturing of the -- of
[17]the -- of the membrane.
[18]I -- I don't think Vitamin E -- I -- I
[19]fully understand its full mechanism, but I do
[20]think it's an example of something that has an
[21]impact on cell lysis without necessarily being
[22]defined as a membrane stabilizer.
[23]Ultimately, the membrane is destabilized
[24]because it has to be in order for the cell
[25]to -- to rupture.
  Page 200
[1]So I -- I -- I will -- I will -- go by
[2]my -- my first answer, which is, I don't know the
[3]mechanism of all of the compounds that were
[4]listed.
[5]Q. So if we could turn to Exhibit 5, which is
[6]the '720 patent, column 6.
[7]A. Okay. '720, column 6, yes.
[8]Q. We're back to the -- the list of examples.
[9]A. Uh-huh.
[10]Q. Vitamin E appears in the passage, in
[11]column 6, lines 49 through 65.
[12]A. Yeah, in that paragraph -- "Vitamin E, and
[13]Vitamin E derivatives," yes.
[14]Q. And in this paragraph the list of
[15]exemplary compounds, it's characterized as a list
[16]of "agents that stabilize cell membranes to
[17]re" -- "reduce maternal cell lysis."
[18]Do you see that?
[19]A. I do see that.
[20]Q. So is it your testimony that Vitamin E
[21]does not stabilize cell membranes?
[22]A. I will stand corrected that -- that based
[23]on what I am learning, being instructed by the
[24]patent, I am being instructed by the patent that
[25]Vitamin E and derivatives fall into a category of
  Page 201
[1]membrane stabilizers.
[2]As I said, I didn't -- I -- I don't know
[3]the mechanism of all of these, nor did I memorize
[4]all the lists and which categories they fit in.
[5]Q. So my question was just a little
[6]different.
[7]I was asking if you can give me an example
[8]of anything that would, to your understanding,
[9]qualify as a cell lysis inhibitor that would not
[10]already be encompassed in "membrane stabilizer"
[11]or "cross-linker."
[12]A. It -- again, I wasn't asked to -- to
[13]determine mechanisms and distinctions among all
[14]of those compounds in the groupings.
[15]But, again, if you get something like
[16]alcohols that -- that dehydrate cells, by
[17]dehydrating the cells you basically fix the
[18]cells. You don't necessarily stabilize the
[19]membrane. You actually just fix the cells by
[20]dehydrating, removing water from the contents of
[21]the cells. So there -- there's -- there's
[22]no -- there's no pressure inducer to burst the
[23]cell.
[24]But you are preserving the structure of
[25]the cell by the use of an alcohol that dehydrates
  Page 202
[1]and removes water components from the cell.
[2]I -- I would argue that one might
[3]interpret that as an inhibitor of cell disruption
[4]without necessarily preserving -- being a
[5]membrane stabilizer.
[6]But, again, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not an
[7]expert on all of these compounds and I -- I do
[8]admit that.
[9]Q. Okay.
[10]MS. MAJOR: Let's mark --
[11]THE WITNESS: On -- on -- this is
[12]one -- may I ask for a -- a break here so I can
[13]use the restroom? That is --
[14]MS. MAJOR: Of course.
[15]THE WITNESS: Would this -- be okay
[16]to break now?
[17]MS. MAJOR: That's fine.
[18]VIDEOGRAPHER: We are -- we are going
[19]off the record. Time now is 3:43.
[20](Recess from 3:43 p.m. to 3:57 p.m.)
[21]VIDEOGRAPHER: One moment.
[22]We are back on the record. This is the
[23]start to Media No. 5. The time is 3:57.
[24]MS. MAJOR: All right. Could we
[25]please mark Tab 15 as Exhibit 8.
  Page 203
[1]CONCIERGE: Sure thing.
[2](Deposition Exhibit No. 8 marked.)
[3]THE WITNESS: Bug is back.
[4]Q. (By Ms. Major, continuing) And,
[5]Doctor Van Ness, if you can let me know when you
[6]have Exhibit 8 on your screen, I'd appreciate it.
[7]CONCIERGE: Exhibit 8 should be in
[8]your folder, if you refresh.
[9]A. (Continuing) Okay. I do have it up.
[10]Q. All right. And do you recognize Exhibit 8
[11]as the Rabinowitz patent that we've been
[12]discussing as one of the patents identified in
[13]your reply claim construction declaration?
[14]A. I do.
[15]Q. I'm --
[16]A. You are correct. That is the -- that is
[17]the -- the patent that I identified.
[18]Q. I'll refer to this, for the record, as the
[19]'415 publication.
[20]You see on the face of the '415
[21]publication that it was filed on July 1, 2020.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. And the earliest provisional application
[25]relied on by the '415 publication was filed on
  Page 204
[1]November 26, 2005.
[2]Correct?
[3]That, again, is beside the 60.
[4]A. Yes, I see that, yes.
[5]Q. So the earliest potential filing date of
[6]the '415 publication, that you point to in your
[7]declaration, was over three years after the
[8]alleged invention of Ravgen's patents.
[9]Correct?
[10]A. That provisional file date is about three
[11]years after the Ravgen file date. Correct.
[12]Q. And, to be clear, you're not relying on
[13]the '415 publication to support your opinions
[14]about the claim constructions for the Ravgen
[15]patents.
[16]Correct?
[17]A. It is -- I'm not relying on this as my
[18]sole basis for my opinion.
[19]Q. But a person of ordinary skill in the art
[20]at the time of the alleged invention of Ravgen's
[21]patents would never have known about the '415
[22]publication that you point to in your
[23]declaration.
[24]Correct?
[25]A. Correct. But the people who file the
  Page 205
[1]patent would probably know about the Ravgen
[2]filing and understand its use of the term "cell
[3]lysis inhibiter."
[4]So I would -- I guess I would argue, the
[5]people who filed this patent would certainly know
[6]the use of the term "cell lysis inhibiter" and
[7]probably were aware of -- of the Ravgen patent's
[8]use of that term, as we saw in the last patent.
[9]Q. But the '415 publication doesn't
[10]demonstrate that the term "cell lysis inhibiter"
[11]was understood by persons of skill in the art at
[12]the time of the alleged invention of Ravgen's
[13]patents.
[14]Correct?
[15]A. It does not demonstrate that nor does it
[16]refute it.
[17]Q. So, to sum up, you looked for patents that
[18]used the term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[19]Do I have that right?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. Did you look for articles that used the
[22]term?
[23]A. I -- I -- as I recall, I did a brief
[24]search of articles. That probably wasn't the
[25]most exhaustive search engine to use.
  Page 206
[1]Q. And you were unable to find any patent or
[2]articles, from whatever search engine you used,
[3]as of the date of the Ravgen claimed invention
[4]that used the term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[5]Correct?
[6]A. That is correct. But it doesn't change my
[7]opinion.
[8]Q. But we can agree on this. You were not
[9]able to identify a single patent or reference
[10]from the time of the alleged invention that uses
[11]the term "cell lysis inhibiter."
[12]Correct?
[13]A. Yes. But that doesn't -- not mean that in
[14]the context of the patent, where it was used, it
[15]was not understood.
[16]I -- I do think I have to decline the
[17]alternative, which is, that does not mean that
[18]the term was not understood in its use in the
[19]patent.
[20]It simply means that it was not used
[21]in -- in a publication.
[22]Q. At any time prior to the Ravgen patents
[23]that you've been able to find. Correct?
[24]A. Again, I don't believe that my search was
[25]an exhaustive search, which means there may be
  Page 207
[1]publications out there that use that term. It's
[2]kind of difficult to -- to do a word search on
[3]every publication. I did not find it.
[4]I do not believe that is a demonstration
[5]that it does not exist. I think it's simply a
[6]demonstration that I did not find.
[7]But it does not change my opinion.
[8]Q. Well, wouldn't you agree that if a term is
[9]widely used in the art, then one should be able
[10]to point to references using that term?
[11]A. I -- I -- I don't necessarily agree with
[12]that. I mean, cell lysis inhibitor is synonymous
[13]sometimes with other things. You know, people
[14]use the term "fixative." You know, cell lysis
[15]inhibitors, as described by the patent, were
[16]things that fixed cells. And the term "fixative"
[17]was used quite frequently.
[18]And so I would -- I would think that a
[19]cell lysis inhibitor and a fixative are commonly
[20]understood terms.
[21]And, again, I would argue -- I don't even
[22]want to say "argue."
[23]I would contend that the use of the term
[24]"cell lysis inhibiter" is in light of what -- how
[25]it was being used in the patent, with all of this
  Page 208
[1]description that was provided.
[2]It isn't an isolated term. It's a term.
[3]It's in the context of an entire patent.
[4]Q. But if I told you that a term was well
[5]known and you couldn't find that term ever used
[6]in a printed publication, you would be skeptical
[7]of my claim.
[8]Correct?
[9]A. I think you're mischaracterizing my
[10]understanding of the -- the term definition.
[11]And, again, I think you're
[12]mischaracterizing that there has to be an
[13]extrinsic use of the term, when the intrinsic use
[14]made the term well understood.
[15]Q. And, again, what are you pointing to as
[16]intrinsic use of the term "cell lysis inhibiter"
[17]that makes that well understood?
[18]A. We went through column 6, that described
[19]agents that -- that stop cells from lysis. The
[20]term "cell lysis inhibiter" is -- is used in the
[21]patent. And there's a very extensive
[22]description, both in terms of background, saying
[23]there are reagents, there are agents that impede
[24]cell lysis. And then in the examples they are
[25]using them.
  Page 209
[1]And -- and the end result is that the
[2]cells are inhibited from lysing by use of these
[3]agents.
[4]Therefore, when I get to the claim and
[5]they say a "cell lysis inhibitor," I have no
[6]problem understanding what they mean.
[7]Again --
[8]Q. But you acknowledge --
[9]A. -- it's my understanding and my opinion.
[10]I -- I -- it -- based on what I'm reading.
[11]And I'm being asked to offer an opinion of
[12]one skilled in the art, that when that term was
[13]used in the context of the entire patent, my
[14]opinion, my understanding was, I had no problem
[15]understanding what -- how that term was being
[16]used and how it was being defined.
[17]Q. But I believe you've acknowledged that you
[18]don't understand the mechanisms of all of the
[19]hundred-plus compounds that are listed in the
[20]patent as compounds that can be used in the
[21]invention.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I don't, but as a person skilled in the
[24]art, if somebody said that these were cell lysis
[25]inhibiters and I was potentially interested in
  Page 210
[1]using them, as a person skilled in the art, I'd
[2]look them up, because most of these probably have
[3]published indicators as to how they act and what
[4]they do.
[5]So the fact that I can't give you an exact
[6]mechanism of every compound is -- I -- I would
[7]also consider that -- as a person skilled in the
[8]art, I would certainly have the ability to find
[9]out what these compounds do, if I was motivated.
[10]I wasn't asked to do that, so I -- I
[11]didn't do that. But a person skilled in the art
[12]certainly could find out what these compounds do.
[13]Q. But you are looking exclusively to the
[14]list of compounds of various unknown functions,
[15]but described in the patent specification as
[16]"cell lysis inhibitors," to understand what
[17]qualifies as a cell lysis inhibitor.
[18]Do I have that right?
[19]A. I am looking to those compounds as
[20]examples that the patent teaches me, or compounds
[21]that meet the definition of a cell lysis
[22]inhibitor.
[23]And when some of those compounds, like
[24]formalin or glutaraldehyde are used, they, in
[25]fact, result in the consequence of an
  Page 211
[1]identifiable impediment of lysis, because the
[2]maternal cells are not spilling their DNA. They
[3]are not lysing.
[4]So I -- my -- the patent is instructing me
[5]to the term, giving me examples -- some of which
[6]I actually do know -- using those examples, and
[7]demonstrating their effect.
[8]That sum total of intrinsic evidence in
[9]the patent, in my opinion, gave me an
[10]understanding of how the term "cell lysis
[11]inhibiter" was being used.
[12]Q. Okay. I'll refer you to paragraph 51 of
[13]your opening claim construction declaration,
[14]Exhibit 1.
[15]A. Okay. Let me go -- Exhibit 1. And,
[16]again, paragraph 51.
[17]Q. Paragraph 51, yes.
[18]A. Okay.
[19]Q. On page 18 of the PDF.
[20]A. If you give me just a moment, I'd like to
[21]read it, so I -- when we get to that.
[22]Okay.
[23]Q. Okay. And in paragraph 51 of your opening
[24]declaration you say you "agree with Doctor Grody
[25]that a POSITA would readily understand what is
  Page 212
[1]meant by 'cell lysis' and, plus, understand cell
[2]lysis inhibitors to be the category of chemical
[3]substances that prevent or reduce the rupture of
[4]cell membranes and release of cellular contents
[5]by protecting or preserving the structural
[6]integrity of the cells."
[7]Do you see that?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. Now, thinking about the membrane
[10]stabilizer category. Do membrane stabilizers
[11]prevent or reduce the rupture of cell membranes?
[12]A. Some do. And I would argue that -- that
[13]some membrane stabilizers may stabilize the
[14]membrane, but insufficient to counter the lysis
[15]that may be occurring with the kind of stress
[16]that these cells are in -- seeing.
[17]So I think a membrane stabilizer can
[18]prevent cell lysis. It can be a -- a cell lysis
[19]inhibitor.
[20]I'm not sure if I would characterize that
[21]every membrane stabilizer is always a cell lysis
[22]inhibitor. I would -- would not go so far as
[23]to -- to make that total generalization.
[24]Q. Do membrane --
[25]A. And I --
  Page 213
[1]Q. -- stabilizers --
[2]A. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[3]Q. Do membrane stabilizers protect or
[4]preserve the structural integrity of the cell?
[5]A. With those that I am familiar with? Yes.
[6]So there are -- there are agents that are
[7]listed that meet those requirements that I fully
[8]understand. Yes.
[9]Q. Earlier I asked about any exemplar --
[10]excuse me -- any cell lysis inhibitors beyond
[11]those exemplary ones listed in the specifications
[12]of the asserted patents.
[13]About how many more are there beyond the
[14]specific examples listed in the patent
[15]specifications?
[16]A. I have no idea. I was not asked to
[17]investigate the total universe of -- of cell
[18]lysis inhibitors. I was asked to -- if the
[19]language provided enough clarity that -- that I
[20]understood the terms.
[21]I -- I -- I felt it did.
[22]I was not charged with looking for other
[23]examples.
[24]Q. So you don't know if there are five
[25]compounds that qualify as cell lysis inhibitors,
  Page 214
[1]as you understand that term, but that aren't
[2]listed in the specification or hundreds of
[3]compounds that meet your understanding of cell
[4]lysis inhibitor that aren't specifically listed.
[5]Is that right?
[6]A. I don't, but, as one skilled in the art, I
[7]could find out, A, by looking things up and B, if
[8]there was any compound that -- that might be
[9]suspected of being a cell lysis inhibitor, I
[10]could experimentally determine that.
[11]Q. How would you experiment --
[12]A. I was not charged -- one could add
[13]different amounts of an agent and determine
[14]whether the cells were rupturing by measuring
[15]intercellular contents that are now spilled out.
[16]There are also fairly standard cell
[17]biology methods where you add a dye, like trypan
[18]blue. And if a cell is in the process of lysing,
[19]the trypan blue seeps into the cell; whereas, a
[20]healthy, intact cell excludes the dye.
[21]So there are -- and there are biochemical,
[22]biophysical methods to measure a -- membrane
[23]potentials across cells. Intact cells maintain a
[24]membrane potential gradient; whereas cells that
[25]are lysing do not.
  Page 215
[1]There are a number of experimental
[2]approaches that can determine whether an agent is
[3]causing or preventing cell lysis.
[4]Q. Earlier you referenced that EDTA could
[5]ultimately have the effect of reducing cell
[6]lysis.
[7]Correct?
[8]A. It's one of the agents that is capable of
[9]impeding cell lysis, but it does not meet the
[10]asserted claim categories.
[11]Q. How, in any experimental assessment you do
[12]of a compound, would you evaluate whether
[13]something is a cell lysis inhibitor based on any
[14]of the techniques you used, if there are
[15]compounds like EDTA that have the same effect as
[16]the ultimate result that you are looking for,
[17]meaning the spilling of intercellular
[18]components --
[19]A. I might do an experiment --
[20]Q. -- other --
[21]A. I might do an experiment exactly as
[22]described in the patent, in examples four and 15,
[23]in which EDTA is added to the cells. And then
[24]EDTA, plus a cell lysis inhibitor defined as a
[25]membrane stabilizer, like formalin, is added.
  Page 216
[1]And ask, did the addition of the membrane
[2]stabilizer decrease the amount of contents of the
[3]cell that spilled out?
[4]That was exactly the way the experiment
[5]was done.
[6]And, also, as one skilled in the art, I
[7]also am aware that EDTA prevents blood clotting,
[8]which provides a stress to cells that can cause
[9]lysis.
[10]But, EDTA does not preserve the structure
[11]of the cells for any period of time that might be
[12]useful as a diagnostic technique that the -- the
[13]patent might approach, because over a period of
[14]four to six to eight hours, even the EDTA is not
[15]effective in preventing cell lysis. It prevented
[16]the stress, but other stresses, by having cells
[17]sit there, cause those cells to lys. And EDTA
[18]will not prevent that.
[19]So I think experiments were done that
[20]demonstrate very clearly the impact of a lysis
[21]inhibitor described in the patent.
[22]And my own experience is that EDTA, as an
[23]anticoagulant, is not particularly effective as a
[24]cell lysis inhibitor by doing anything described
[25]in the patent in one of those three categories.
  Page 217
[1]Q. But we're back to a timing requirement, in
[2]your view. I presume, if you measure a compound
[3]that's mixed with just EDTA, after an hour there
[4]will be less of the cellular components that have
[5]spilled out than if you measure a compound that
[6]hasn't been mixed with EDTA after an hour.
[7]Correct?
[8]A. Haven't done the experiment. I -- and, I
[9]guess, neither -- neither have you. So I -- I --
[10]you're -- you're making a presumption.
[11]I haven't seen the data to -- on the
[12]results of that -- of that hypothetical
[13]experiment.
[14]Q. You haven't reviewed the Lee reference?
[15]A. You mean the Lee patent? That -- that --
[16]that patent? I don't recall on --
[17]Q. Okay.
[18]A. -- on that.
[19]Q. All right. Well, let's turn to membrane
[20]stabilizer. What is the definition of a membrane
[21]stabilizer, in your understanding?
[22]A. In my understanding, a membrane stabilizer
[23]preserves the structure of a membrane or, to put
[24]it another way, fixes the cells so that the
[25]membrane does -- is -- is -- it -- the structure
  Page 218
[1]of the cell and the membrane is retained. So
[2]it's stabilizing the structural surroundings of
[3]the cell that is the mem -- the -- that is
[4]defined as the membrane.
[5]Q. And is that the definition as you
[6]understand it today or as of the time of the
[7]alleged invention in Ravgen's patents?
[8]A. Well, it's certainly my understanding
[9]today. And I think at the time of the Ravgen
[10]patents, given the fact that we understood that
[11]our use of membrane stabilizer primarily was to
[12]preserve the cells so that we could look at
[13]cellular structures -- I think my understanding
[14]of membrane stabilizer -- to keep the cells
[15]intact so we could follow with the next set of
[16]analysis -- would say that I probably would have
[17]the same definition.
[18]But that was a time ago.
[19]Q. So it's your testimony that you and your
[20]team was conducting research using membrane
[21]stabilizers as of the date of the Ravgen patents?
[22]A. Yeah, I think we were using membrane
[23]stabilizers as of that point.
[24]Q. And what specific membrane stabilizers
[25]were you using?
  Page 219
[1]A. They were using methanol alcohol and --
[2]and formalin.
[3]Q. Now, a little while ago you referred to
[4]alcohol as a cell lysis inhibitor that wouldn't
[5]necessarily preserve the integrity of the
[6]membrane.
[7]Do I have that right?
[8]A. You're correct. I did say that.
[9]Q. So is it now your testimony that alcohols
[10]are membrane stabilizers?
[11]A. If -- if I may, hold off on -- just a
[12]minute.
[13]I guess -- hold on just a minute.
[14]I -- I've -- my answer to that question is
[15]that my use of the alcohols was to preserve the
[16]structural integrity of the cell.
[17]I'm not entirely sure on its mechanism. I
[18]was speculating as -- as something that
[19]dehydrates.
[20]It probably also precipitates proteins,
[21]which fixes the cell, but it probably is -- is
[22]not maintaining the original structure of the
[23]membrane, because it is dehydrating and -- and
[24]probably precipitating some of the proteins in
[25]that membrane, so, as a result, it fixes the
  Page 220
[1]cells. It doesn't necessarily preserve the
[2]structure of the membrane, but it preserves the
[3]integrity such that the membrane is not allowing
[4]the internal contents to -- to be released.
[5]That's my -- my best understanding of how
[6]that might work.
[7]Q. So, given that understanding, are alcohols
[8]membrane stabilizers, as you understand that term
[9]as used in the patents -- the Ravgen patents?
[10]A. I would put them in the category of cell
[11]lysis inhibitors. And I defer to knowing the
[12]full mechanic -- to being sure of the full
[13]mechanisms.
[14]I just used my background in the science
[15]to -- to speculate. And that's not -- I -- I do
[16]not want to stand by a speculation.
[17]So I will say I would put it into the
[18]category as a cell lysis inhibitor. And I'm not
[19]completely 100 percent sure of its mechanism.
[20]Q. Okay. You would agree that the Ravgen
[21]patents don't define membrane stabilizer.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I don't recall whether there was a
[24]specific -- the definition of "membrane
[25]stabilizer" is, so I don't recall seeing a
  Page 221
[1]specific definition of "membrane stabilizer."
[2]Q. And the Ravgen patents don't identify any
[3]dictionary that expressly defines "membrane
[4]stabilizer."
[5]Correct?
[6]A. They do not.
[7]But, again -- I keep coming back to
[8]this -- that to one skilled in the art,
[9]stabilizing a membrane with a membrane stabilizer
[10]was understood. I -- I would say that that term
[11]is understood.
[12]There are a lot -- there are -- are ways
[13]to stabilize a membrane, such as cross-linking
[14]the protein, but I think the term "membrane
[15]stabilizer" in 2001 was a term that a person of
[16]skill in the art would understand without
[17]uncertainty.
[18]Q. Well, setting aside the asserted patents
[19]themselves, the Ravgen patents don't identify any
[20]patent that uses the term "membrane stabilizer."
[21]Correct?
[22]A. Would you repeat that again? I apologize.
[23]Q. Sure.
[24]Setting the asserted patents to the side,
[25]the Ravgen patents don't identify any patent that
  Page 234
[1]Exhibit 21, which is Tab 9.
[2]Q. And Exhibit 9, on your screen, is the Wang
[3]article referenced in paragraph 63 of your
[4]declaration.
[5]Correct?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. And the Biochemical Pharmacology journal
[8]article authored by Wang was first accepted
[9]as -- by the publication on December 5, 2005.
[10]Correct?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. So the Wang article that you point to in
[13]your declaration was published over four years
[14]after the alleged invention of Ravgen's patents.
[15]Correct?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. So you understand that the Wang article is
[18]not relevant to how to construe the terms in the
[19]much earlier Ravgen patents.
[20]Correct?
[21]A. Not entirely. Because, again, I would
[22]argue that -- that the date of December -- or
[23]received November 2005 -- was not the first time
[24]this group used the term "membrane stabilizer."
[25]This does not indicate that -- that this
  Page 235
[1]term was limited to that date.
[2]Certainly this group was understanding of
[3]the term "membrane stabilizer" before they wrote
[4]the paper, otherwise they wouldn't have used the
[5]term "membrane stabilizer" without knowing what
[6]it meant before they wrote the taper.
[7]How long before they knew it? I don't
[8]know. But I would argue --
[9]Q. So are you --
[10]A. -- a person skilled in the art would --
[11]would know in 2001.
[12]Q. So are you relying on this later-published
[13]Wang article in support of your opinions
[14]regarding claim construction for the Ravgen
[15]patents?
[16]A. I'm not relying on it. I'm simply
[17]pointing to it as an indication of the use of the
[18]term that was understood by people that were
[19]using that term prior to 2005. How long prior, I
[20]don't know, but I -- wasn't dependent -- this was
[21]not a dependent reliance on just this paper, for
[22]me to contend that the term "membrane stabilizer"
[23]was understood in 2001.
[24]Q. And you would -- you would agree that a
[25]person of skill in the art at the time of the
  Page 236
[1]alleged invention of Ravgen's patents would never
[2]have known about the Wang article that you point
[3]to in your declaration.
[4]Correct?
[5]A. I might argue that the people in the Wang
[6]laboratory would know about that term and they
[7]are probably people who may well be skilled in
[8]the art. And when they knew about the term
[9]"membrane stabilizer" -- certainly before 2005,
[10]maybe as early as 2001.
[11]So I'm not -- I'm not -- I don't think
[12]this paper discounts my contention that the term
[13]was well understood.
[14]I simply am saying, I wasn't relying on
[15]this paper alone to contend that "membrane
[16]stabilizer," as a term, was understood in the
[17]context of how it was used in 2001, in the Ravgen
[18]patent.
[19]That opinion --
[20]Q. My --
[21]A. -- is still the same.
[22]Q. My question is just a little different.
[23]So a person of skill in the art at the
[24]time of the Ravgen patents would not have known
[25]about the Wang article that was published in
  Page 237
[1]2005.
[2]Correct?
[3]A. They would not have read or had access to
[4]this article before 2005, unless they were
[5]intimately involved in a laboratory and got early
[6]drafts, but I -- I -- I accept the -- the fact
[7]that a person skilled in the art in 2001 would
[8]not have seen a paper published in 2005.
[9]Q. All right. You also point to an article
[10]by Grau, et al., from the publication Chemistry
[11]and Physics of Lipids.
[12]MS. MAJOR: So let's mark that
[13]article next. That's Tab 17. If we could please
[14]have that marked as Exhibit 10.
[15]CONCIERGE: Okay.
[16](Deposition Exhibit No. 10 marked.)
[17]CONCIERGE: Exhibit 10 should be in
[18]your folder, if you refresh.
[19]A. (Continuing) Okay. I have it up.
[20]Q. All right. Now, to be clear, in your
[21]reply declaration you don't point to anyplace in
[22]the Grau article that defines the term "membrane
[23]stabilizer."
[24]Correct?
[25]A. They don't define it, but they use it with
  Page 238
[1]the reasonable assumption that people understood
[2]how they were using it.
[3]Q. And your declarations also don't identify
[4]any instance in which the Grau article discusses
[5]cell lysis.
[6]Correct?
[7]A. That wasn't one of their measures, was --
[8]was measuring -- they were looking at membrane
[9]hydrolysis, which is -- can lead to -- to -- one
[10]with skill in the art would understand that
[11]membrane hydrolysis could lead to cell lysis.
[12]But, as -- as pointed out in the -- say,
[13]for an example, in the abstract -- it says that
[14]these tocopherol Vitamin E derivatives, such as
[15]PLA inhibitors, are discussed considering its
[16]biologic significance as a membrane stabilizer.
[17]So they are using the term "membrane
[18]stabilizer" in a paper published prior to 2001.
[19]Q. But the Grau article uses the term
[20]"membrane stabilizer" to describe the function of
[21]certain things, such as tocopherols.
[22]Right?
[23]A. Well, that agent they are describing --
[24]they are describing as a membrane stabilizer.
[25]And I would make a certain conclusion that
  Page 239
[1]if "membrane stabilizer" was a term that was
[2]totally unfamiliar, the editors may not accept
[3]that as something that they should be describing
[4]without a point of definition.
[5]Having said that, my contention is that a
[6]person of skill in the art knew what a membrane
[7]was. We were all trying to stabilize membranes
[8]to preserve the integrity of the cell. As a
[9]result, the use of the term in this abstract and
[10]in the paper -- the biologic significance of a
[11]membrane stabilizer -- stabilizer would be well
[12]understood.
[13]Q. Well, if we look at PDF page 9, Grau talks
[14]about -- this is -- let you get there.
[15]A. I'm there.
[16]Q. Let me know when you're -- oh.
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. So if you look in the paragraph that
[19]begins, "To conclude," in the right column.
[20]A. Okay.
[21]Q. About four lines up from the bottom.
[22]"The results are reported as relevant to
[23]explain the stabilizing role of toco" --
[24]"tocopherols and biological membranes."
[25]Do you see that?
  Page 240
[1]A. I do.
[2]Q. And in your declaration you suggest that
[3]the Grau article discusses Vitamin E as a
[4]membrane stabilizer.
[5]Do I have that right?
[6]A. Well, the -- the derivative -- they are --
[7]Vitamin E is -- is a tocopherol. So there are
[8]derivatives of tocopherol that we could refer to
[9]as Vitamin E derivatives.
[10]Q. Okay. And in examining the stabilizing
[11]role that the Vitamin E derivatives have on
[12]biological membranes, Grau finds that Vitamin E
[13]may inhibit PLA2 activity.
[14]Correct?
[15]A. Okay. It -- that -- in the first
[16]sentence, "We conclude in this paper that alpha
[17]tocopherol inhibits PLA2 activity when present in
[18]fluid membranes at low concentrations."
[19]Correct.
[20]Q. And that's the activity Grau was assessing
[21]to determine whether Vitamin E's derivatives had
[22]a stabilizing effect on the membrane?
[23]A. That is my understanding.
[24]Q. Now, you're aware that Grau also discusses
[25]cholesterol. Correct?
  Page 241
[1]A. I -- I -- it's been awhile since I've
[2]looked at this paper, but I -- I do recall there
[3]was some discussion about cholesterol. I -- I,
[4]frankly, don't recall the exact context. I would
[5]have to go through the paper and -- and identify
[6]that and see how that's used.
[7]Q. Sure.
[8]If you look at the cover of the article.
[9]A. Yep.
[10]Q. The very first page.
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. About five lines up from the -- or six
[13]lines up from the bottom of the abstract it says,
[14]"Cholesterol does not inhibit PLA2 activity."
[15]Do you see that?
[16]A. I do see that.
[17]Q. So Grau found that cholesterol didn't
[18]inhibit the very activity that it was relying on
[19]to identify Vitamin E derivatives as having a
[20]stabilizing effect on cell membranes.
[21]Correct?
[22]A. Well, I think, to be more -- more
[23]specific, he's saying cholesterol does not
[24]inhibit PLA2 activity at concentrations even
[25]higher than those of tocopherol.
  Page 242
[1]So he's defining a specific compound and
[2]suggesting cholesterol does not inhibit that
[3]compound's activity.
[4]Q. But that activity is what Grau used to
[5]conclude that Vitamin E derivatives acted as
[6]membrane stabilizers.
[7]Correct?
[8]A. In -- in separate experiments.
[9]He then looked at the tocopherols and
[10]concluded that the tocopherols did provide
[11]membrane stabilization.
[12]Q. So, in essence, Grau found that
[13]cholesterol doesn't play a stabilizing role on
[14]biological membranes --
[15]A. No. He found that --
[16]Q. -- derivatives do?
[17]A. No. He found that cholesterol in the
[18]context of PLA2 doesn't provide a
[19]stabilizing -- it may provide stabilizing
[20]activity by inhibiting other things that are
[21]going on. I don't know what they are.
[22]But this certainly simply says cholesterol
[23]does inhibit PLA2. That's a very specific
[24]compound they are artificially putting into the
[25]system.
  Page 243
[1]The fact that cholesterol may be important
[2]in rebuilding and supporting the structure of
[3]lipids in -- in membranes is a totally separate
[4]issue. And may still be effective in inhibiting
[5]lysis and being a membrane stabilizer.
[6]This does not discount cholesterol, in any
[7]condition, can act as a membrane stabilizer,
[8]under that condition, for that compound. That's
[9]all they were saying.
[10]Q. But what Grau reports is that Vitamin E
[11]derivatives have the stabilizing effect on
[12]biological membranes. And cholesterol did not
[13]exhibit the same effects in their experiments.
[14]Correct?
[15]A. When done in the context of phospho --
[16]phospholipase A2, or PLA2. The distinction was
[17]made in the context of a very specific compound.
[18]Q. Now, you're aware that the asserted
[19]patents list cholesterol as an ex -- exemplarily
[20]agent that stabilizes cell membranes.
[21]Correct?
[22]A. I'm aware of that, correct.
[23]Q. And the Grau article that we've been
[24]discussing, in fact, suggests the Vitamin E
[25]derivatives and cholesterol have different
  Page 244
[1]activities or different effects when it comes to
[2]playing a stabilizing role on biological
[3]membranes.
[4]Correct?
[5]A. Correct. In the context of PLA2, a very
[6]specific context.
[7]Q. But, to summarize, you've undertaken a
[8]search to find any use of membrane stabilizer.
[9]Correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]And here was a case where that term was
[12]used with what I interpret as a -- an
[13]understanding of one use of the term "membrane
[14]stabilizer" that in these conditions, this
[15]tocopherol derivative was able to stabilize the
[16]membrane. So it is, by definition, in these
[17]conditions a membrane stabilizer.
[18]Q. But the result of your search for use of
[19]the term "membrane stab" -- "stabilizer" yielded
[20]two examples, one of those from years after the
[21]claimed priority date of the patent.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. And one that reports experiments to
[25]evaluate different -- or the activity of
  Page 245
[1]Vitamin E derivatives and cholesterol.
[2]Correct?
[3]A. In the context of a specific compound,
[4]yes.
[5]Q. And you'd agree that both Vitamin E
[6]derivatives and cholesterol are identified as
[7]exemplary membrane stabilizers in the Ravgen
[8]patents.
[9]Correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. And the single article that you found that
[12]predates the patents and includes the phrase --
[13]phrase "membrane stabilizer," only Vitamin E
[14]exhibits the activity that stabilizes cells, and
[15]cholesterol does not, in the context of that
[16]experiment.
[17]Correct?
[18]A. Thank you. Yes.
[19]Q. So Ravgen's patents use the term in a way
[20]that isn't entirely consistent with what Grau
[21]reports.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. Incorrect.
[24]Q. You would agree that Grau reports that
[25]Vitamin E derivatives and cholesterol exhibit
  Page 246
[1]different activities in the context of this
[2]experiment.
[3]Correct?
[4]A. I -- in the context of those experiments,
[5]that is correct.
[6]The Ravgen patent doesn't limit itself to
[7]one condition of things that -- that destabilize
[8]membranes.
[9]There are lots of things that destabilize
[10]membranes. One of them is this PLA2.
[11]Other things cholesterol may be perfectly
[12]effective in.
[13]Q. But you -- you don't know which of the
[14]dozens of exemplary membrane stabilizers actually
[15]have the effect of stabilizing membranes, because
[16]you don't understand the mechanisms of all of the
[17]compounds listed in the Ravgen patents.
[18]Correct?
[19]A. I understand that the -- the patentee has
[20]provided these as an instruction to one skilled
[21]in the art, that these are compounds that meet
[22]the requirement of membrane stabilizers.
[23]In that instruction he does not provide
[24]the mechanism of every one of those compounds.
[25]However, to one skilled in the art, you
  Page 247
[1]could likely find that out relatively easily.
[2]I was not charged to find out the
[3]mechanism of all of these compounds, so I did
[4]not. That does not mean they are ineffective.
[5]It simply means I didn't investigate how each of
[6]those mechanistically works to stabilize
[7]membranes.
[8]Q. Are there additional membrane stabilizers
[9]beyond the exemplary ones listed in the Ravgen
[10]patent specifications?
[11]A. I wasn't asked to investigate and -- and
[12]identify additional ones. I don't know.
[13]Q. So you can't name any others, sitting here
[14]today?
[15]A. I wasn't asked to do that, so I did not
[16]investigate it, so I cannot name an additional
[17]compound.
[18]Q. Now, the exemplary membrane stabilizers
[19]listed in the Ravgen patents don't share a common
[20]structure.
[21]Correct?
[22]A. Chemically they probably don't share a
[23]common structure, but, again, it depends a little
[24]bit on -- on your definition of "structure."
[25]They -- they are structurally equivalent in that
  Page 248
[1]they've stabilized membranes.
[2]The chemical may not be the same
[3]structure, but they have a structural similarity
[4]of stabilizing a membrane structure.
[5]Q. Isn't what you're referring to a
[6]functional similarity, as opposed to a structural
[7]similarity?
[8]A. It's a functional similarity on
[9]maintaining a structure. So they -- they -- they
[10]have a common structural consequence in
[11]maintaining membrane structure.
[12]Q. But you would agree that the exemplary
[13]list of membrane stabilizers includes reagents of
[14]diverse as atoms, simple sugars, complex
[15]carbohydrates, and other numerous compounds?
[16]A. Correct. All of which I would interpret,
[17]as one skilled in the art, as I read the patent
[18]and the descriptions, as all having a common
[19]feature, that they've been listed as compounds
[20]that maintain the structural component of a
[21]membrane.
[22]Q. But they do not themselves share a common
[23]structure. Correct?
[24]A. They do not share a common chemical
[25]structure.
  Page 249
[1]Q. And even if you don't know the mechanism
[2]of every last one of the exemplary membrane
[3]stabilizers, you would agree that they don't
[4]share a common mechanism.
[5]Correct?
[6]A. Since I didn't investigate them all, I
[7]can't answer that question.
[8]Q. Do you think Vitamin E and sucrose have
[9]the same mechanism for stabilizing cell membrane?
[10]A. I don't know the answer to that question.
[11]I'm sorry. I did not investigate the mechanism
[12]of any of those. So I would only be speculating
[13]as to whether they had common mechanisms or
[14]dissimilar mechanisms or had overlapping
[15]mechanisms.
[16]And since I didn't look that up, I don't
[17]feel comfortable speculating on each of their
[18]similarities or differences.
[19]Q. So as part of your analysis to try to
[20]decipher or understand what "cell mem" -- or
[21]"membrane stabilizer" means in the context of the
[22]Ravgen patent claims, you didn't evaluate what
[23]the patents identify as the group of things that
[24]are supposedly membrane stabilizers, to evaluate
[25]what their similarity, if any, may be?
  Page 250
[1]A. My understanding was that the assertion
[2]was that there was an agent that prevented cell
[3]lysis that fit into a category, including
[4]membrane stabilizers.
[5]That those -- the claim terms were very
[6]clear to me, that there's an agent claim, that
[7]there is a -- a -- a dependence on fitting one of
[8]those three categories. And those categories
[9]include membrane stabilizers, cell lysis
[10]inhibitors.
[11]I had no problem understanding what they
[12]meant, although I couldn't give you mechanisms of
[13]every compound that was listed.
[14]There were exemplary compounds listed that
[15]I found instructional, as a person of skill in
[16]the art, that they met the requirements of the
[17]claim as being agents that stabilized membranes.
[18]Q. So it's your understanding that "membrane
[19]stabilizer" and each of the claimed categories,
[20]meaning cell lysis inhibitor and cross-linker, as
[21]well, are well defined.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. Some of them are well defined and some of
[24]them I even know about. So I do think that there
[25]are examples -- well-known examples of things
  Page 251
[1]like formalin, that is a -- well known.
[2]And -- and my understanding of the term
[3]"membrane stabilizer" is significantly enhanced
[4]by my understanding that there are membrane
[5]stabilizers like formalin that serve to
[6]cross-link and stabilize the membrane, in my
[7]understanding of the terms.
[8]As a result of that, while I don't
[9]understand the mechanism of every stabilizer, I
[10]do understand the mechanism of formalin. And, as
[11]a result, I can then understand the term
[12]"membrane stabilizer" to mean a reagent that
[13]stabilizes the structural component of the
[14]membrane.
[15]I -- I have no problem, based on my
[16]knowledge of some of these compounds, putting
[17]that in the context to give me full understanding
[18]of how the claim terms are used.
[19]Q. But the mechanism that formalin relies on
[20]is actually a cross-linking mechanism.
[21]Correct?
[22]A. That's -- it -- it -- cross-link is --
[23]cross-links, that's correct. But it also is a
[24]membrane stabilizer.
[25]Q. But it stabilizes the cell membrane by
  Page 252
[1]cross-linking. Correct?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. So is it your understanding that the
[4]"membrane stabilizer" term, as it's used in the
[5]Ravgen patent, is intended to encompass things
[6]that preserve membrane -- that stabilize
[7]structural components of the membrane by
[8]cross-linking?
[9]A. That is one component of how a membrane
[10]stabilizer can work. And I understand that --
[11]there may be other mechanisms I'm willing to
[12]accept. That there are compounds whose
[13]mechanisms I am not familiar with, but, given the
[14]fact that formalin is a membrane stabilizer that
[15]cross-links -- gives me confidence in
[16]understanding with reasonable certainty what the
[17]patentee is referring to as a mem -- the term
[18]"membrane stabilizer."
[19]Formalin is an exemplary compound that
[20]does that. And, as a result, I understand what
[21]it's doing and I understand what the term
[22]"membrane stabilizer" means.
[23]Q. What other mechanisms can be used to
[24]stabilize a membrane and fall within this
[25]category of membrane stabilizer?
  Page 253
[1]A. I don't know. I have not investigated
[2]other mechanisms.
[3]Q. So you assume that "membrane stabilizer"
[4]is understood without actually understanding the
[5]full scope of what "membrane stabilizer" covers?
[6]A. It covers a compound that -- that can
[7]demonstrate -- demonstrate inhibition of lysis.
[8]Formalin is one example of that.
[9]If -- if you say to me that formalin is a
[10]membrane stabilizer, I fully accept my
[11]understanding of the term "membrane stabilizer"
[12]based on that simple statement that formalin is a
[13]membrane stabilizer.
[14]So your question is to whether the
[15]definition of "membrane stabilizer" is
[16]understood.
[17]When that sentence is provided to me or
[18]somebody with skill in the art, that formalin is
[19]a membrane stabilizer, I understand all the terms
[20]of that sentence.
[21]I don't need to know all of the other
[22]compounds. I understand how the term "membrane
[23]stabilizer" is being used.
[24]Q. But what in that sentence tells you about
[25]all of whatever other mechanisms might result in
  Page 254
[1]membrane stabilization and might qualify,
[2]therefore, as a membrane stabilizer --
[3]A. Well --
[4]Q. -- if you have just the example of
[5]formalin?
[6]A. That -- that statement doesn't provide
[7]that.
[8]On the other hand, the asserted patent --
[9]the asserted claims of the patent and the
[10]invention of the patent in no way suggests that
[11]any of these agents were being invented by the
[12]patentee.
[13]They were simply being used because they
[14]were -- they were known to the patentee as a list
[15]of compounds that prevented cell lysis and
[16]stabilized membranes.
[17]I will acknowledge the fact that the
[18]patentee maybe knew more about those -- those
[19]compounds than I do.
[20]But to one skilled in the arts, you were
[21]instructed by the patent of a compound well known
[22]in the art that stabilizes membranes. That, in
[23]turn, gave me clear definition of what the term
[24]"membrane stabilizer" implied and what -- how it
[25]was being used. And, therefore, I understood
  Page 255
[1]that the other compounds that were listed as
[2]membrane stabilizers met that criteria.
[3]Do I know how they do it?
[4]I don't.
[5]Could I find out?
[6]Probably, I could look them up and find
[7]out.
[8]Q. But you didn't look them up. Correct?
[9]A. I did not.
[10]Sorry. I talked over you.
[11]THE WITNESS: My apologies, Nancy.
[12]A. (Continuing) I did not.
[13]Q. Now, you understand that a patent claim is
[14]indefinite when it fails to inform with
[15]reasonable certainty those skilled in the art
[16]about the scope of the claim.
[17]Correct?
[18]A. With -- read in light of the
[19]specifications. Or the intrinsic evidence.
[20]Q. And -- and in your opening declaration you
[21]say that the patent claims can allow for some
[22]degree of uncertainty.
[23]Do you recall that?
[24]A. I recall that phrase, yeah.
[25]Q. How much uncertainty is allowed before a
  Page 256
[1]claim fails to inform with reasonable certainty
[2]those skilled in the art about a claim scope?
[3]A. I think -- as -- example, if there are
[4]terms used that have ambiguity or have multiple
[5]meanings, then it may create a degree of
[6]uncertainty, because a term may have multiple
[7]meanings.
[8]I think the term "cell lysis inhibiter,"
[9]"membrane stabilizer" had very well-defined
[10]meanings. They didn't have multiple meanings.
[11]So, as an example, I think if terms are
[12]used that have multiple meanings, it would reach
[13]a degree of uncertainty that would start to
[14]qualify as indefinite. But I don't see that as a
[15]case here.
[16]Q. But you've just acknowledged that
[17]"membrane stabilizer" applies to a host of
[18]compounds with unknown mechanisms.
[19]Do I have that right?
[20]Mechanisms you're not even aware of?
[21]A. I think there's an important distinction.
[22]And that is --
[23]Q. Okay.
[24]A. -- it points to compounds that I don't
[25]know what -- what they do, but, as I interpret
  Page 257
[1]the patent, the clear language of the patent --
[2]patent says, "These compounds I list as exemplary
[3]compounds as membrane stabilizers."
[4]I understand the term. There is no
[5]uncertainty about how the term is being used and
[6]what it's directing me to.
[7]The fact that I don't know the mechanism
[8]of all of those terms doesn't change my
[9]understanding of -- of the terms or create an
[10]uncertainty of the term that's being used.
[11]Q. All right. I'm going to shift gears. And
[12]I have a few questions about just the word
[13]"agents."
[14]So not the long phrase that is included in
[15]the patent claims, but just the term "agent."
[16]Do you have that in mind?
[17]A. I -- I -- I -- I -- sorry. I need context
[18]here. I can't -- I mean, you can take a word out
[19]and pull it out and just place it on the board
[20]and I could give you lots of definitions. But
[21]the definition I'm most interested in is in the
[22]context of the patent, as it's used.
[23]Q. Yeah. Just to be clear, I'm just trying
[24]to clarify, for you and for the record, that when
[25]I'm saying "agent" now, I'm using just the word
  Page 258
[1]"agent."
[2]A. Okay.
[3]Q. Not the lengthy --
[4]A. I -- I appreciate --
[5](Multiple voices.)
[6]A. (Continuing) Okay. So -- I got you. I
[7]was being contentious before I even -- okay. My
[8]apologies.
[9]Q. So, to your understanding, in the context
[10]of the claims and the specification and other
[11]intrinsic evidence, what is an agent?
[12]A. My understanding is, an agent is a
[13]substance which creates an effect.
[14]Q. And you would agree with me that the term
[15]"agent that impedes cell lysis" is describing the
[16]function of the agent.
[17]Correct?
[18]A. Ah, but there was more to that phrase.
[19]And that is, the agent impedes cell lysis and is
[20]part of a group that fits into those three
[21]categories.
[22]So I -- you -- there -- there is a --
[23]there is a restriction on the use of the term
[24]"agent" to both functionally impede lysis and be
[25]a member of one of those groups.
  Page 259
[1]Q. Understood, regarding the full scope of
[2]the disputed term.
[3]I'm just asking about the words "agent
[4]that impedes lysis" in the context of the claims.
[5]Those words, "agent that impedes cell
[6]lysis," describe the function of an agent.
[7]Correct?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. And it is an agent that performs a
[10]particular function of impeding license.
[11]Correct?
[12]A. It -- in the clear language of the claim,
[13]it's -- an agent that impedes lysis -- I think
[14]that's fairly clear, correct.
[15]Q. So you would agree with me that "agent
[16]that impedes cell lysis" -- that portion of the
[17]claim language uses functional language.
[18]Correct?
[19]A. There is a function in impedes that is
[20]blocking -- so yes, it -- it -- it is using a
[21]functional characterization of the action of
[22]that.
[23]Since "agent" is a substance that has an
[24]action, the agent that's being described --
[25]description of the action is a function. It
  Page 260
[1]impedes cell lysis.
[2]Q. To impede cell lysis is a function.
[3]Correct?
[4]A. One could argue that that is one --
[5]one -- one -- what's the word I want? -- it's one
[6]description that -- that one could use, that
[7]there's a function, impede lysis, that is being
[8]associated with the agent. Sure.
[9]Q. And "inhibits lysis of cells" is also a
[10]function.
[11]Correct?
[12]A. Under those circumstances and -- correct.
[13]Q. And now focusing on the three categories
[14]referenced in the "agent" terms, so the full
[15]claim term that's being disputed.
[16]Do you have those three categories in
[17]mind?
[18]A. I do. Membrane stabilizer, cross-linker
[19]and cell lysis inhibitor.
[20]Q. Yes.
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. Those categories of agents use functional
[23]language, as well. Correct?
[24]A. Could you point me to that? I mean,
[25]you're -- you're pointing to something that I
  Page 261
[1]can't see. You're -- what -- by -- what do you
[2]mean by that?
[3]Q. So "membrane stabilizer," for instance,
[4]describes something that stabilizes membranes.
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. Right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Stabilizing membranes is a function.
[9]Correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. And the term "membrane stabilizer" does
[12]not connote any particular struct -- structure
[13]that performs the function of stabilizing the
[14]membrane and inhibiting cell lysis.
[15]Correct?
[16]A. It does not define a particular chemical
[17]structure of the agent that is performing that.
[18]Correct.
[19]Q. Does it define any other structure that
[20]performs the function of inhibiting cell lysis
[21]and stabilizing membranes?
[22]A. The only structure it refers to is the
[23]structure of the agent and those agents that
[24]perform that, that fit into those categories,
[25]have various structures. So there is not a
  Page 262
[1]single structure that's defined by that.
[2]Q. Now, "cell lysis inhibitor" is one of the
[3]other categories referenced in the claim term.
[4]Correct?
[5]A. That's correct.
[6]Q. And "cell lysis inhibitor" describes
[7]something that inhibits cell lysis.
[8]Would you agree?
[9]A. And, again, within -- in light of the --
[10]of the description, it inhibits cell lysis by
[11]maintaining the structural integrity of the cell
[12]membrane, yes.
[13]Q. And in -- inhibition of cell lysis by
[14]maintaining the structural integrity of the cell
[15]membrane is also a function.
[16]Correct?
[17]A. I could say that -- I could agree that
[18]that's a function.
[19]Q. And the term "cell lysis inhibiter" does
[20]not connote any particular structure that
[21]performs the function of inhibiting cell lysis.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. There is no single chemical structure that
[24]is implied by that term.
[25]Q. Is there any other structure that is
  Page 263
[1]implied by the term "cell lysis inhibiter"?
[2]A. Again, you've -- you -- based on how you
[3]phrased it, the implication is the structure --
[4]is the structure of the membrane, so it does
[5]preserve the structure of the membrane.
[6]The agent has commonality because it
[7]preserves -- preserves the structure of the
[8]membrane.
[9]Q. But, again, the commonality of the agent
[10]that you're referring to -- the commonality is in
[11]its function, because it functions to preserve
[12]the structure of the membrane.
[13]Do I have that right?
[14]A. I -- I'm okay with that.
[15]Q. And, by the way, you mentioned you
[16]reviewed Doctor Grody's deposition transcript, I
[17]believe.
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. Is that right?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. And you're -- so you're aware with and
[22]agree -- strike that.
[23]So you're aware of and agree with
[24]Doctor Grody's testimony that there's no common
[25]structure among membrane stabilizers.
  Page 264
[1]Correct?
[2]A. I -- I -- I think there's an important
[3]distinction here. The common structure of the
[4]membrane stabilizers is that they are an agent.
[5]And the reason I say that is that
[6]distinguishes things that may inhibit cell lysis
[7]that have no agent associated with them.
[8]So there is a structure that is an agent,
[9]a compound, a substance that can inhibit cell
[10]lysis.
[11]There are other means to achieve impeding
[12]cell lysis that have nothing to do with a sub --
[13]a substance, an agent or a structure.
[14]Things like centrifugation, heat, the size
[15]of the needle. Things like that can also induce
[16]lysis. Or you can prevent lysis by changing the
[17]bore size of the needle, by centrifuging more
[18]slowly.
[19]But those are not agents that -- so that
[20]the common structural component that -- that I
[21]view in -- in the claim terms is -- it's a
[22]structure of an agent, a chemical substance --
[23]not other things that can impede lysis that are
[24]not agents.
[25]They are not structurally -- not
  Page 265
[1]compounds, they are not agents that do it. They
[2]are themselves some process that alters the
[3]function of cell lysis.
[4]Q. So the -- the only structure you're
[5]suggesting exists in the full "agent" term is
[6]agent itself.
[7]Do I have that right?
[8]A. I would interpret that as the agent has a
[9]structure that meets the requirements of the
[10]claim and that other things that impede cell
[11]lysis, that don't have any agent structure at
[12]all, that are just activities that can be done --
[13]don't meet the claim terms.
[14]VIDEOGRAPHER: Excuse me. We've got
[15]about five minutes left on this media.
[16]MS. MAJOR: Let's go off the record
[17]to change it and we can continue.
[18]VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the
[19]record. Time now is 5:21.
[20](Recess from 5:21 p.m. to 5:31 p.m.)
[21]VIDEOGRAPHER: One moment.
[22]We are back on the record. This is the
[23]start to Media No. 6. The time is 5:31.
[24]Q. (By Ms. Major, continuing) All right.
[25]Doctor Van Ness, before the break you were
  Page 266
[1]talking about your understanding that the thing
[2]that provides any structure at all in the claim
[3]is the term "agent."
[4]Do I have that right?
[5]A. Yes. I -- I think the fact that there is
[6]a -- a -- a structure, an agent, a substance, as
[7]opposed to an action to cause another action,
[8]distinguishes that term as a -- a structural
[9]term.
[10]That's -- that's my understanding.
[11]Q. Okay. But you would agree that cell lysis
[12]inhibitor doesn't provide any common structure.
[13]Correct?
[14]A. Well, if we go -- if you go back to what
[15]we just agreed -- what I just agreed was my
[16]understanding, the cell lysis inhibitor goes back
[17]to the "agent" term, which is a structure of a
[18]substance that creates a -- the -- the inhibition
[19]of lysis. So I think the lysis inhibitor is an
[20]agent.
[21]Q. So you're saying cell lysis inhibitor
[22]is -- strike that.
[23]So is it your testimony that a cell lysis
[24]inhibitor must have a structure because it is an
[25]agent that is a substance?
  Page 267
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. But you would agree that there is no
[3]common structure in the category "cell lysis
[4]inhibitor"?
[5]A. We're -- I -- I'm -- I'm facing a somewhat
[6]circular argument here, which is that the common
[7]structural component is the "agent" term, which
[8]distinguishes it from a nonstructural component,
[9]which is, there is no substance, there is no
[10]agent.
[11]And you can do things to impede lysis that
[12]does not include an agent, that meets the
[13]definition of a cell lysis inhibitor, which is an
[14]agent that has structure.
[15]So I -- I -- I kind of went circular, but
[16]I want to distinguish function of the agent from
[17]function of things that are not an agent that
[18]fits into those categories.
[19]Q. But you would agree that there is no
[20]common structural -- strike that.
[21]You would agree there's no structural
[22]commonality, no shared chemical structure, no
[23]other kind of characteristics of cell lysis
[24]inhibitors that puts them into a class of
[25]compounds having a shared structure.
  Page 268
[1]A. There is no shared -- there -- there is no
[2]share -- well, there are compounds that have
[3]shared structure. I mean, the aldehydes have --
[4]whether it's glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde, they
[5]both have aldehydes as part of their structure.
[6]So there are examples where there are
[7]common structures, but across all the categories
[8]there is not a common chemical structure.
[9]I'm not sure that that -- puts any
[10]question about the certainty of the claims,
[11]because I wouldn't expect every compound that
[12]inhibits lysis to have the same structure
[13]in -- in how it operates.
[14]So I -- I agree that the "agent" term is
[15]the structural term and the cell lysis inhibitor
[16]refers back to that "agent" term.
[17]Q. And you agree that there's no common
[18]structural -- strike that.
[19]You would agree that membrane stabilizers
[20]do not connote a common structure. Correct?
[21]A. I would say that, based on my limited
[22]knowledge of the compounds that were listed as
[23]exemplary, they don't have a common chemical
[24]structure.
[25]Q. And the same is true for cell lysis
  Page 269
[1]inhibitors. If you think about the exemplary
[2]compounds identified as cell lysis inhibitors,
[3]they don't share any chemical structure.
[4]Correct?
[5]A. I'm not a -- I'm -- I'm not aware that
[6]they share a chemical structure.
[7]Q. And the same is true for the cross-linkers
[8]provided as exemplary cross-linkers in this
[9]specification. There's no shared common chemical
[10]structure among the cross-linkers identified
[11]there.
[12]Correct?
[13]A. Well, there again, there are some common
[14]chemical structures among some of the
[15]cross-linkers, like the aldehydes. So there are
[16]common structures among a -- a list of
[17]cross-linkers.
[18]Q. But they don't -- but all of the
[19]cross-linkers identified as exemplary
[20]cross-linkers don't share a single common
[21]chemical structure.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I'm not aware that they do.
[24]Q. Okay. Let's turn to the parties' dispute
[25]regarding the isolating and detecting term in
  Page 278
[1]the art."
[2]Did I read that correctly?
[3]A. You did.
[4]Q. So you're only pointing to the plain
[5]language of the plain term as the basis for what
[6]you've described as the method that corresponds
[7]to the claim language.
[8]Correct?
[9]A. I am stating that based on the plain
[10]language of the claim term and for the reasons
[11]listed above, which include a description of --
[12]of information that I would have received from
[13]the patent, it would all be readily
[14]understandable.
[15]So I -- my -- my answer to your question
[16]is, I agree with -- based on the plain language
[17]of the claim terms, the scope of the isolating
[18]detecting was readily understandable.
[19]And, I -- I mean, are -- are you con --are
[20]you challenging that I didn't include -- with
[21]understanding of the intrinsic evidence?
[22]Because I think that's implied, that any
[23]time you read --
[24]Q. You --
[25]A. -- a claim term, you -- in determining
  Page 279
[1]whether it is definite or indefinite, you read
[2]the claim term in light of the intrinsic
[3]evidence.
[4]So I think, from a legal standpoint,
[5]that's implied in that statement.
[6]Q. You haven't pointed to specific intrinsic
[7]evidence as supporting your position in this
[8]section of your declaration, though.
[9]Correct?
[10]A. In this section I didn't point to
[11]something specific. I -- if -- if you give me a
[12]minute...
[13]So the reason -- the reason I'm looking
[14]here is because within the context of my
[15]declaration there are places where I point to
[16]various specifications which inform me that the
[17]plain language of the claim is understood.
[18]In that sentence, referring to other
[19]specific parts of the -- the patent that -- that
[20]have specifications is not present in that
[21]particular sentence, but in the scope of my
[22]entire declaration I point to various places that
[23]the -- that provide specification clarity.
[24]Q. You would agree, if you look at the -- the
[25]heading labeled A at the top of PDF page 26,
  Page 280
[1]that -- that the title for the section -- that it
[2]refers to "A POSITA would understand the scope of
[3]the isolating and detecting terms with reasonable
[4]certainty based on the plain language of Claim 1
[5]of the '720 patent."
[6]Correct?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Okay. And so, just to be clear, two steps
[9]in Claim 1 of '720, A and B. Correct?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. A requires isolating. Right?
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. B requires detecting. Right?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. The B limitation follows the A limitation.
[16]Correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. And B refers back to A. Correct?
[19]A. B follows from A, that isolating free
[20]nucleic acid is then used to detect the presence
[21]or absence of the free nucleic acids. So B does
[22]follow from A.
[23]Q. Well, let's look at the claim language, as
[24]opposed to your declaration. So if you could
[25]please pull up the '720 patent again, Exhibit 5.
  Page 281
[1]A. And which claim are you --
[2]Q. Claim 1.
[3]A. Okay. I'm there.
[4]Q. All right. In the preamble, the actual
[5]language of Claim 1 of the Ravgen '720 patent
[6]reads, "A method for detecting a free nucleic
[7]acid."
[8]Correct?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. And we can agree that the preamble of
[11]Claim 1 of the '720 patent does not say, "A
[12]method for detecting a particular free nucleic
[13]acid."
[14]Right?
[15]A. There -- there are a lot of dependencies
[16]on that, because, depending on your application,
[17]you wouldn't define, in Claim 1, a particular
[18]free nucleic acid. It could be a cancer. It
[19]could be a fetal. It could be an organ
[20]transplant nucleic detection.
[21]So I think the claim indicates that a
[22]method is being provided for detecting a free
[23]nucleic acid that in subsequent claims are
[24]defined as cancer cells, organ transplant or
[25]fetal cells -- fetal DNA.
  Page 282
[1]Q. But you would agree with me, the word
[2]"particular" does not appear in front of the word
[3]"free" in the preamble of Claim 1 of the '720
[4]patent.
[5]Correct?
[6]A. That word does not appear in front
[7]of -- "particular" does not appear in that
[8]sentence. Correct.
[9]Q. And we can agree that Claim 1 -- strike
[10]that.
[11]And we can agree that the preamble of
[12]Claim 1 of the '720 patent does not say, "A
[13]method for detecting a free nucleic acid with a
[14]mutation."
[15]Correct?
[16]A. It doesn't define that in that claim,
[17]correct.
[18]Q. For the isolating step in part A of the
[19]claim, the actual language of Claim 1 of the
[20]Ravgen '720 patent reads, "A, isolating free
[21]nucleic acid from a noncellular fraction of a
[22]sample."
[23]Correct?
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. We can agree, this step of the method
  Page 283
[1]claim is denoted as step A. Correct?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. And we can agree it does not say
[4]"isolating a mixture of free nucleic acid."
[5]Correct?
[6]A. It doesn't say that, but I think one
[7]skilled in the art would know that if you're
[8]isolating a DNA from a noncellular fract --
[9]fraction, you would be getting a mixture of DNA.
[10]Q. But we can agree, the words "a mixture of"
[11]don't appear in step A of Claim 1 of the '720
[12]patent.
[13]Correct?
[14]A. The words "mixture of" does not appear,
[15]but, again, one skilled in the art would
[16]understand that isolating DNA from a noncellular
[17]fraction would certainly have a mixture of DNA.
[18]Q. But the words "a mixture of" don't appear
[19]anywhere in Claim 1 of '720 patent. Correct?
[20]A. Those words do not appear.
[21]Q. Now, for the detecting step, the actual
[22]language of Claim 1 of the Ravgen '720 patent
[23]reads, "B, detecting the presence or absence of
[24]the free nucleic acid."
[25]Correct?
  Page 284
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. We can agree, this step of the method
[3]claim is denoted as step B. Correct?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. And we can agree, step B of Claim 1 of the
[6]'720 patent does not say "detecting the presence
[7]or absence of the particular free nucleic acid of
[8]interest within the isolated free nucleic acid."
[9]Correct?
[10]A. It does not say that, but there's a
[11]distinction between the method for detecting a
[12]free nucleic acid -- and now the presence or
[13]absence of the free nucleic acid implies a
[14]specific nucleic acid.
[15]The -- the word "the" I would interpret
[16]as the -- as "the free nucleic acid of interest."
[17]Q. But the words "of interest" do not appear
[18]in step B of Claim 1 of the '720 patent.
[19]Correct?
[20]A. It does not. But, again, reading this
[21]patent with the clarity that I would have with
[22]the intrinsic evidence, I would understand it to
[23]mean "the free nucleic acid target," because that
[24]is the intrinsic evidence, the speci --
[25]specifications and examples that are given.
  Page 285
[1]So reading this claim, in light of all of
[2]that other material, I would have an
[3]understanding that that would mean the free
[4]target DNA that's trying to be detected.
[5]Q. Well, you would agree, the specification
[6]does talk about target DNA, DNA of interest,
[7]nucleic acid having a mutation.
[8]Correct?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. It uses all those terms when it wants to
[11]be specific about a particular kind of nucleic
[12]acid to be detected.
[13]Correct?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. Now, Claim 1 of the '720 patent does not
[16]say "isolating some free nucleic acid and
[17]detecting whether the particular free nucleic
[18]acid of interest is present or absent."
[19]Correct?
[20]A. It does not say that.
[21]Q. And Claim 1 of the '720 patent also does
[22]not say, "detecting the presence or absence of a
[23]free nucleic acid with a mutation."
[24]Correct?
[25]A. There is -- could you hold on just a
  Page 286
[1]minute?
[2]Q. Sure.
[3]A. So Claim 1 is a claim that is understood
[4]to be the method for isolating the new -- the DNA
[5]and detecting the presence.
[6]But then, as you move to Claim 7, the
[7]dependent claim, Claim 1, "where said nucleic
[8]acid con" -- "constitutes at least one mutation."
[9]So, as we read the claims, there is
[10]dependent claims that further limit with
[11]understanding that -- that nucleic acid of
[12]interest has at least one mutation, as in
[13]Claim 7.
[14]Q. But Claim 1 of the '720 patent does not
[15]say, "detecting the presence or absence of a free
[16]nucleic acid with the mutation."
[17]Correct?
[18]A. Claim 1 doesn't say that. Claim 7 does.
[19]Q. But we're focused on the terms appearing
[20]in Claim 1. Correct?
[21]That's the disputed term on which you've
[22]rendered an opinion. Right?
[23]A. And, again, I would argue that those terms
[24]cannot be construed in the absence of other
[25]material in the patent.
  Page 287
[1]You can't simply take a claim -- a -- a
[2]claim, pull it out, and then try to interpret the
[3]terms in isolation of all of the other components
[4]of the patent, including the specifications
[5]description, and following through with the
[6]patent to the dependent in claim, where you
[7]actually do have a mutation limitation.
[8]Q. But we've established that the
[9]specification talks about mutations and talks
[10]about nucleic acid of interest when it intends
[11]to.
[12]Correct?
[13]A. When it is instructive, correct.
[14]Q. And the word "mutation" does not appear
[15]anywhere in Claim 1 of the '720 patent. Correct?
[16]A. It does not, but it does appear in
[17]Claim 7.
[18]Q. Now, we've discussed that the isolating
[19]and detecting steps are denoted in Claim 1 of the
[20]'720 patent as steps A and B of this method
[21]claim.
[22]Do you agree?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. And you're not suggesting that there's no
[25]relationship between steps A and B in Claim 1.
  Page 288
[1]Correct?
[2]A. I'm -- there was a double negative in
[3]there. Could we -- could we rephrase that?
[4]Q. I'll take that out.
[5]You agree there's a relationship between
[6]steps A and B in Claim 1 of the '720 patent.
[7]Correct?
[8]A. Read in light of the full patent? It's
[9]very clear there's a relationship between A and
[10]B.
[11]Q. Well -- and the natural reading of Claim 1
[12]of the '720 patent is that step A and step B
[13]inform one another.
[14]Fair?
[15]A. I'm not sure if I would characterize it as
[16]informing one another. I think step A -- step B
[17]is derived from the material obtained in step A.
[18]Step B is -- is -- as you said, it's a
[19]relationship in which step B follows from step A.
[20]They don't inform each other. In other words,
[21]you can't do step B before you do step A.
[22]Q. Agreed.
[23]And a person of ordinary skill who wanted
[24]to understand step B of Claim 1 of the '720
[25]patent should look to step A.
  Page 289
[1]Correct?
[2]A. If they wanted to practice the art that's
[3]provided in the patent, they would look to step A
[4]before doing step B.
[5]Q. Okay. Now, let's say I have a method for
[6]making a coffee.
[7]Are you with me?
[8]A. So far. Okay. You've got a coffee
[9]method. Okay. You're -- you're making coffee.
[10]Okay.
[11]Q. Step A is collecting coffee from my
[12]cabinet.
[13]Are you still with me?
[14]A. I -- I'm there. Yeah. Okay.
[15]Q. Okay. And step B is adding the coffee to
[16]my coffee maker.
[17]Are you with me?
[18]A. So far.
[19]Q. If anyone is --
[20]A. I understand what you're doing. Okay.
[21]Q. If -- if anyone is unclear about step B,
[22]we can agree it would be natural to look at step
[23]A for guidance.
[24]Correct?
[25]A. Not necessarily. At least in your
  Page 290
[1]example, if you're going to add coffee to your
[2]coffee maker, where you got it from -- at least
[3]in your example -- you could get it from the
[4]cabinet above, the cabinet to the left, the
[5]cabinet to the right. You could get it from
[6]anywhere.
[7]So I'm not sure your example is -- I'm
[8]following its relationship that B is dependent on
[9]A.
[10]Certainly you have to get the coffee.
[11]Q. But --
[12]A. But where you get it from -- where you get
[13]it from is -- is not entirely required.
[14]Q. Well, in my hypothetical, step A requires
[15]collecting coffee from my cabinet. Okay?
[16]A. I -- I guess I would agree with you, step
[17]A requires collecting your coffee.
[18]From the cabinet? It -- it's that --
[19]that -- that phrase is not necessary. You're
[20]collecting coffee.
[21]Q. But the words in the claim have meaning.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. Well, I -- I -- they do, but I'm -- I'm
[24]not trying to be difficult, but your hypothetical
[25]is B is dependent on me collecting the coffee
  Page 291
[1]from the cabinet.
[2]And my argument is, B is dependent on your
[3]collecting coffee. I'm not sure it's dependent
[4]on you getting it from the cabinet. You could
[5]get it from your brother, who hands it to you.
[6]So I'm -- I -- I don't think the dependency is
[7]quite as clear on the cabinet term, in your
[8]hypothetical.
[9]Q. Well, in my hypothetical the claim
[10]requires collecting coffee from my cabinet.
[11]And step B requires adding the coffee to
[12]my coffee maker.
[13]A. Okay. So if I --
[14]Q. Have those two steps in mind.
[15]A. Okay. And can I -- can I agree that you
[16]have established a method that requires that you
[17]get the coffee from the cabinet and that you add
[18]that coffee to the cabinetmaker? To the
[19]cabinet -- to the coffee maker?
[20]Q. Would you a -- you would agree that the
[21]coffee in step B refers to the coffee I collected
[22]from my cabinet in step A.
[23]Right?
[24]A. Insofar as you defined it as requiring it
[25]to come from the cabinet.
  Page 292
[1]Q. Put the cabinet to the side.
[2]You agree that the coffee in step B refers
[3]to the coffee I'm collected in step A.
[4]A. I -- I agree.
[5]Q. That's the natural reading. Right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. And you can agree with me that in claim
[8]construction you have to take the claim language
[9]as it is in the claims.
[10]Correct?
[11]A. You have to be able to understand it with
[12]reasonable certainty in the claim construction.
[13]Q. You can't rewrite claim language in order
[14]to interpret claims.
[15]Correct?
[16]A. Correct. But you do so in -- with a
[17]background of person of skill and all of the
[18]other components. So you aren't doing this
[19]coffee analogy in isolation.
[20]You are -- you need -- you need to know
[21]what coffee is. And I'm assuming you know what
[22]coffee is. So your skill in the art is, at least
[23]I know what coffee is.
[24]So I do think that a person of skill in
[25]the art would interpret the relationship based on
  Page 293
[1]their understanding of the component terms and
[2]their skill in the art.
[3]Q. But we can agree that you cannot write --
[4]rewrite claim language when doing claim
[5]construction.
[6]Correct?
[7]The first --
[8]A. Correct.
[9]And -- and, in your scenario, the only way
[10]that this claim could be fulfilled is that you
[11]have to get the coffee from the cabinet and you
[12]have to put it in the coffee maker.
[13]Q. Okay. Well, let's focus now on Claim 1 --
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. -- of the '720 patent.
[16]You would agree with me that if the free
[17]nucleic acid in the detecting step is the same as
[18]the free nucleic acid in the isolating step, then
[19]it's impossible to practice the full scope of the
[20]claim, because you can't detect the absence of
[21]the very thing you've just isolated.
[22]Correct?
[23]A. I think, again, within skill in the art,
[24]with the understanding, with skill in the art,
[25]that the free nucleic acid you're isolating in A
  Page 294
[1]is a mixture, and in B you're detecting the free
[2]nucleic acid of interest, understood by skill in
[3]the art, that it is possible, in the language
[4]of -- of one skilled in the art, to talk about
[5]detecting free DNA or finding that a target DNA
[6]is absent from that mixture of DNA.
[7]So I think the plain meaning of the
[8]language is clear. You can run a method to
[9]detect DNA and fail to detect it within the
[10]limits of your detection sensitivity.
[11]And I think all of those components I just
[12]described would be well known to a person of
[13]skill in the art.
[14]Q. But your interpretation of the claim
[15]requires applying two different meanings for the
[16]very same words, even though they appear in the
[17]claim the same way.
[18]So free nucleic acid in step A, in your
[19]view, means something different than free nucleic
[20]acid in step B.
[21]Correct?
[22]A. Free nucleic acid in step A means
[23]something different than the free nucleic acid of
[24]step B, which -- which is defined quite
[25]adequately in the intrinsic evidence and -- and
  Page 295
[1]subsequent claims.
[2]I think there's a distinction between
[3]isolating free nucleic acid -- that a person of
[4]skill would understand what that means -- and
[5]detecting the presence or absence of the free
[6]nucleic acid. A person with -- of skill would
[7]understand that the -- the free nucleic acid is
[8]likely a target nucleic acid, which is confirmed
[9]by reading the rest of the patent.
[10]Q. But you would agree with me, that in your
[11]interpretation of the claim you are applying a
[12]meaning of "free nucleic acid" in step A to be
[13]mixture of free nucleic acid.
[14]Correct?
[15]A. I'm defining that as a person of skill
[16]would recognize that in the context of -- of what
[17]the patent was achieving. You would be getting a
[18]mixture --
[19]Q. But --
[20]A. -- of DNA.
[21]Q. But, in your view, "free nucleic acid" in
[22]step A means "a mixture of free nucleic acid."
[23]Correct?
[24]A. That would be my understanding, that that
[25]nucleic acid would contain a mixture.
  Page 296
[1]Q. And, in your view, "free nucleic acid," as
[2]it appears in step B, means something different.
[3]It means "particular free nucleic acid."
[4]Correct?
[5]A. Which is my interpretation that the "the"
[6]term is referring to the free DNA of interest.
[7]Q. But the bottom line is, you're applying
[8]two different meanings for the term "free nucleic
[9]acid."
[10]Correct?
[11]A. The bottom line is, I'm inferring two
[12]different meanings because each of those meanings
[13]have a different context and a different process.
[14]In A it's isolating and B it's detecting. So the
[15]context of A and B is entirely different.
[16]Q. Now, in your declaration you opine that
[17]the '720 patent specification provides guidance
[18]to a person of skill to understand the scope of
[19]Claim 1.
[20]Correct?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And you point to a particular embodiment.
[23]Isn't that right?
[24]A. Where are you referring to in -- in that?
[25]Q. Let's look at paragraph 84 of your
  Page 297
[1]declaration.
[2]A. Okay. Okay.
[3]Q. So paragraph 84 of your declaration
[4]references an embodiment that appears at
[5]column 22, lines 58 to 66 of this '720 patent.
[6]Correct?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Now, this is the only embodiment from the
[9]'720 patent that you discuss in your declaration.
[10]Right?
[11]A. In -- in -- in the entire declaration?
[12]Q. In the reference to --
[13]A. Oh.
[14]Q. In reference to this claim term. Sorry.
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. Now, you agree there are many, many other
[17]embodiments described in the patent
[18]specification.
[19]Correct?
[20]A. Took a while to read through all of them.
[21]Yes.
[22]Q. But this is the one that you discuss in
[23]the --
[24]A. This is the one --
[25]Q. -- context --
  Page 298
[1]A. -- I discuss --
[2]Q. -- you --
[3]A. -- in paragraph 84. This is the one I
[4]discuss. Correct.
[5]Q. And in the embodiment that you discuss,
[6]step A is isolating nucleic acid. Right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Now, a -- again, context? From a plasma
[9]sample. One skilled in the art would understand
[10]that the nucleic acid from a plasma sample is
[11]cell-free DNA, which would be a mixture.
[12]So I'm -- it's not a leap of understanding
[13]that a person of skill in the art would recognize
[14]that a plasma sample would be cell-free DNA that
[15]contained a mixture.
[16]Q. You would agree with me that the claim
[17]itself does not refer to collection -- I'm
[18]sorry -- isolation from a plasma sample.
[19]Correct?
[20]A. The Claim 1 does not -- does not do that,
[21]but Claim 5 says the sample is blood. And
[22]Claim 6 says the sample is plasma.
[23]As a person of skill in the art, I go,
[24]"Ah-ha, I understand what they are doing here."
[25]Q. But Claim 5 or Claim 6 -- are supposed to
  Page 299
[1]be more specific methods than what's claimed in
[2]Claim 1.
[3]Correct?
[4]A. They are dependent claims.
[5]Q. And Claim 1 does not reference collecting
[6]from a plasma sample -- I'm sorry -- isolating
[7]from a plasma sample.
[8]Correct?
[9]A. Claim 1 does not specifically indicate
[10]a -- a plasma sample. It -- it does say,
[11]"isolating free nucleic acid."
[12]And one -- again, going the other
[13]direction, if I'm isolating from plasma, it's
[14]free nucleic acid. If I'm isolating free nucleic
[15]acid, it must be from an acellular portion of the
[16]sample I've started with. Plasma. I'm sorry.
[17]Plasma.
[18]Q. So are you now suggesting that your
[19]reading of Claim 1 is, it must be collected from
[20]a plasma sample?
[21]A. No. My reading Claim 1 doesn't -- doesn't
[22]restrict it from being isolated from -- just from
[23]plasma.
[24]But the meaning of isolating free nucleic
[25]acid from a noncellular fraction -- one can
  Page 300
[1]define the noncellular fraction to a person
[2]skilled in the art is either serum or plasma.
[3]Q. Thank you.
[4]Now, in the embodiment that you discuss,
[5]step B is detecting the presence or absence of a
[6]nucleic acid molecule containing the mutation.
[7]Correct?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. And based on this embodiment you conclude
[10]that a skilled person would be reasonably certain
[11]regarding the scope of the "isolating" and
[12]"detecting" terms in Claim 1 of the '720 patent.
[13]Correct?
[14]A. In light of the embodiments that I -- that
[15]I refer to, a person of skill in the art would be
[16]reasonably sure of understanding that.
[17]Q. But you understand that the embodiment you
[18]discuss in your declaration uses different
[19]language from Claim 1 of the '720 patent.
[20]Correct?
[21]A. I don't -- I -- that is correct, but I
[22]don't consider that the embodiments that clarify
[23]the meaning of terms can -- are restricted to
[24]only the language of the claim construction.
[25]They are providing additional
  Page 301
[1]clarification about the scope.
[2]And so if you're going to say that
[3]specifications and embodiments can only use the
[4]words in the -- the claim, then you are -- are
[5]really kind of short-circuiting the ability to
[6]understand the claim as it's meant in this
[7]particular patent.
[8]MR. DESMARAIS: Counsel --

[15]about 17 minutes left.

[1]nucleic acid" in the preamble and step B.
[2]Correct?
[3]A. The "free nucleic acid" in the preamble
[4]and step B is a component present in the free
[5]nucleic acid isolated in step A. Or -- or not.
[6]That is, it may not be detected.
[7]MS. MAJOR: Okay. Thank you.
