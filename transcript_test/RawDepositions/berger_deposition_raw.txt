[2]Q. Good morning, Doctor.
[3]Can you please state your name for the record,
[4]please?
[5]A. Brent Daniel Kerger.
[6]MR. MATHEWS: Kerger, okay, and I will attempt
[7]to pronounce your last name correctly. If I
[8]misspeak, I apologize in advance.
[9]Let me show you, first, what's been marked --
[10]or what we'll mark as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, if I
[11]can figure out how to do it correctly.
[12]Can you all see my screen or no?
[13]MS. CAPODICE: No, I can't.
[14]MR. MATHEWS: Okay.
[15]MS. CAPODICE: There we go.
[16]MR. MATHEWS: Great, and here we go. All
[17]right.
[18]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[19]Q. Doctor, what you should be seeing on the screen
[20]is the plaintiff's second amended notice to take your
[21]deposition today.
[22]Can you see that okay?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. And have you seen this document prior to
[25]today's deposition?
  Page 6
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And you'll look -- I'm going to advance this
[3]down to Exhibit A for you.
[4]Were you able to take a look at what's been
[5]marked as Exhibit A to this deposition?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Okay, and that exhibit requests certain
[8]documents, is that correct?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. And were you able to -- and actually, the
[11]document request is Exhibit B.
[12]Were you able to review Exhibit B prior to
[13]today's deposition?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And we were provided with some invoices from
[16]your company, Exponent.
[17]Other than those invoices did you provide or
[18]bring any other documents to the deposition today?
[19]A. I brought the deposition notice, our retention
[20]agreement, the invoices and my report and CV.
[21]MR. MATHEWS: All right, we'll set that aside
[22]as Exhibit 1.
[23](Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, marked for
[24]identification)
[25]BY MR. MATHEWS:
  Page 7
[1]Q. And let me go ahead and pull up, just for the
[2]record, what we'll mark as Exhibit 2, which is on the
[3]screen now and contains 112 pages, and is a copy of your
[4]report.
[5]Does 112 pages sound accurate for the report
[6]that you provided in this matter?
[7]A. I think so.
[8]MR. MATHEWS: Okay. All right, and this is a
[9]little bit different, doing it this way remotely, so
[10]I will state, for the record, that it's the report
[11]that was provided to us that I'm now showing and
[12]we'll mark as Exhibit 2.
[13](Plaintiff's Exhibit 2, marked for
[14]identification)
[15]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[16]Q. If we go down to page, oh, I believe it's
[17]Appendix B to your report which starts your CV, could
[18]you turn to that and the one you have in front of you.
[19]A. Sure. Okay.
[20]Q. Okay, and that page, is it consistent with the
[21]one that's appearing on the screen right now?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Okay, and based just solely on Exhibit B and
[24]your CV that's attached to your report, is it current
[25]and accurate as of today's deposition?
  Page 8
[1]A. Yes, it should be. April 2020, at the bottom,
[2]that's the most current version.
[3]Q. Okay, so, you haven't had any additional papers
[4]published or presentations made at any conferences since
[5]that time?
[6]A. No.
[7]Q. That's a bad question.
[8]That was a correct statement that you have not,
[9]correct?
[10]A. That's correct.
[11]Q. All right, and we see here that you got your
[12]Ph.D. in toxicology from the University of Arkansas in
[13]1988, is that correct?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. All right, and you became board-certified in
[16]1994.
[17]Tell me about that process. What did you have
[18]to do to become board-certified?
[19]A. Well, you have to have five years of
[20]professional experience, and then you get three letters,
[21]two or three letters of recommendation from existing
[22]board-certified toxicologists that endorse your -- that
[23]you participated in the field for that long and you have
[24]the appropriate background, and then you sit through an
[25]exam that's a three-part, three-times-four-hours exam,
  Page 9
[1]and if you pass that exam, then you can become
[2]board-certified.
[3]Q. Okay, and how many times did you take the
[4]examination?
[5]A. The original exam, I took it once.
[6]Q. Okay, and then have you had to take subsequent
[7]exams to stay board-certified over the years?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. Have you ever had to -- have you ever failed
[10]any of those examinations?
[11]A. Well, it's not a pass or -- well, so, every
[12]five years either you take -- take the examination,
[13]which is really test questions for upcoming examinations
[14]of new -- new board certification individuals, so it's
[15]kind of a testing grounds for bad questions, so it's not
[16]unusual for people to -- to have either vague questions
[17]that don't -- don't get -- have more than one answer and
[18]so forth.
[19]So, it's -- so, the bottom line is that it's
[20]not meant to be a pass/fail after you do your original
[21]examination. It's more of a vetting of existing
[22]questions in a very small set compared to what would be
[23]the board certification exam.
[24]Q. All right, and I see that on page 2 of your CV
[25]you're a diplomate of the American Board of Toxicology.
  Page 10
[1]What is that?
[2]A. That's -- that's the certification that we get
[3]when we take the exam.
[4]Q. Okay, and so, tell me a little bit about your
[5]work history.
[6]Where are you currently employed?
[7]A. I'm currently employed by Exponent.
[8]Q. And what is your title there?
[9]A. I'm principal scientist.
[10]Q. Okay, and so, I don't get confused, a principal
[11]scientist -- the word, principal, sometimes, in the
[12]business sense, means ownership or something along those
[13]lines.
[14]When we're talking about in this context, as a
[15]principal scientist or a -- what does that mean?
[16]What are your responsibilities?
[17]A. Well, principal scientist means, in the -- in
[18]the context of Exponent, means that I'm responsible for
[19]the whole -- the whole business, you know, the
[20]responsibility of bringing in the type of work that I
[21]do, managing that work, managing the staff, and all
[22]business administration and technical tasks that's come
[23]with doing quality work under the Exponent company
[24]guidelines.
[25]Q. On average -- well, let's see.
  Page 11
[1]How long have you had that position at
[2]Exponent?
[3]A. I've been at Exponent a little over five --
[4]five years, close to six years.
[5]Q. Okay, and when you first went to Exponent five
[6]or six years ago, were you a principal scientist at that
[7]point?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. All right, and over the last two years
[10]approximately how many hours a week do you spend working
[11]at Exponent?
[12]A. 40.
[13]Q. And of that 40 hours a week, how much of your
[14]time is spent on the science part as opposed to the
[15]business part?
[16]A. The vast majority is on the science part.
[17]Q. And explain to me, if you can, what the
[18]company, Exponent, does.
[19]A. Exponent is an engineering and science
[20]consulting firm that provides high level expertise to
[21]either companies or government entities or individuals
[22]who have specific scientific questions to be answered or
[23]evaluations to be done within the context of any
[24]particular Exponent employee's expertise, it's fairly
[25]broad expertise in the areas of engineering and
  Page 12
[1]health -- health sciences which includes epidemiology,
[2]toxicology, occupational medicine, and other related
[3]fields.
[4]Q. And part of that work that you perform is
[5]litigation support or performing expert witness
[6]services, correct?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. Do you have an idea for Exponent, as a whole,
[9]as to how much of the revenue generated by Exponent is
[10]related to litigation support as opposed to other work
[11]performed by Exponent?
[12]A. I don't.
[13]Q. Would you agree that Exponent receives up to
[14]65 percent of their revenue from litigation support
[15]services?
[16]A. I don't know.
[17]Q. How would we go about finding that out? Who,
[18]at the firm -- at the company, would know that?
[19]A. I -- I don't know. That's not a query that I'd
[20]be concerned about so it's not something that I've
[21]looked into.
[22]Q. Exponent is a publicly-traded company, correct?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. And you, as an employee and principal scientist
[25]for Exponent get paid a salary for your services,
  Page 13
[1]correct?
[2]A. That's correct.
[3]Q. And then you also get paid a yearly bonus based
[4]on the performance of the company, is that correct?
[5]A. I get a bonus, yes.
[6]Q. Well, is that based on the performance of the
[7]company or what is your bonus based upon?
[8]A. Well, yes, certainly it's based on the overall
[9]performance of the company but it's more based on
[10]individual -- individual performance and achievements.
[11]That's the grading system basically, and
[12]there's a pool of money that gets set aside from the
[13]company profits to pay those -- the bonuses to people
[14]who are performing well.
[15]Q. As a principal scientist responsible for
[16]bringing in the business that you work on, is part of
[17]that performance bonus based upon the business that you
[18]actually bring in?
[19]A. Sure.
[20]Q. And is part of that performance bonus based
[21]upon the billables that you generate for Exponent?
[22]A. Yes, yes, yes.
[23]Q. In addition to salary and bonus, you also have
[24]the ability to participate in the deferred compensation
[25]program, is that correct?
  Page 14
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. And do you participate in that deferred
[3]program?
[4]A. No, I don't currently.
[5]Q. Have you, during the five or six years at
[6]Exponent, participated in the deferred compensation
[7]program?
[8]A. I don't -- I don't think I have in terms of
[9]what I understand the deferred payment program is
[10]deferring salary and you would be paid in a given year
[11]and I have not done that.
[12]Q. Also, at Exponent, they provide stock options
[13]from time to time, is that correct?
[14]A. Yes. Part of the -- part of the bonus payments
[15]each year are -- are in stock.
[16]Q. Are they in stock or are they in stock options
[17]or are they in both?
[18]A. I don't really have a good understanding of
[19]that.
[20]My understanding is that part of it -- part of
[21]it is options, meaning, it -- it doesn't occur as money
[22]until a certain period of time later, like, five years,
[23]and I think another is more immediate stock instead of
[24]cash.
[25]Q. And so, in your bonus structure, you have, in
  Page 15
[1]the last five to six years, received either stock or
[2]stock options for Exponent, is that correct?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. Do you know approximately how much your average
[5]salary has been with Exponent over the last five years?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. How much has it been?
[8]A. I can't tell you that. It's not -- it's
[9]confidential. It's company policy not to -- not to
[10]reveal or release that information.
[11]MR. MATHEWS: Okay, and Cami, are you
[12]instructing him not to answer that question or is he
[13]asserting that privilege on his own?
[14]MS. CAPODICE: I'll -- I'll instruct him not to
[15]answer that question since it's confidential to the
[16]company.
[17]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[18]Q. Okay, and would I have the same answer if I
[19]asked the question about the bonus?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. All right, and the same question if -- as it
[22]relates to how many stock options you've received over
[23]the last five or six years?
[24]A. Yeah. I don't really keep track of that
[25]information, anyway, so, I don't know.
  Page 16
[1]Q. Okay. All right, as a publicly-traded company
[2]that Exponent is, would --
[3]MR. MATHEWS: Well, strike that.
[4]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[5]Q. Is it fair to say that you earn more than a
[6]million dollars a year in your services at Exponent?
[7]A. No.
[8]Q. And when I ask that question, you understand
[9]that question to mean salary, bonus and stock all
[10]together?
[11]Is that your understanding of my question?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. Okay, and Exponent, itself, provides litigation
[14]service support to all sorts of companies including the
[15]asbestos industry, is that correct?
[16]A. Well, yeah.
[17]Exponent, as a company -- individuals within
[18]Exponent do provide those services, yes.
[19]Q. And you, yourself, have testified on behalf of
[20]asbestos companies in the past, correct?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And --
[23]A. I should be clear. It's not asbestos
[24]companies, meaning that they make asbestos materials or
[25]mine it.
  Page 17
[1]It's people who -- who have been sued as a
[2]result of product liability relating to use of asbestos
[3]products for the most part.
[4]Q. Fair enough. Poor question on my -- on my
[5]behalf.
[6]So, prior to being at Exponent, you worked,
[7]where?
[8]A. I worked at a company called ChemRisk, which
[9]then became Cardno ChemRisk from 2012 to 2014
[10]Q. They merged with an Australian company, is that
[11]correct?
[12]A. Yes. That's Cardno.
[13]Q. All right, and when was that merger, do you
[14]recall?
[15]A. I recall it being at the end of 2012.
[16]Q. So, while you were with the company they merged
[17]with -- Cardno merged with ChemRisk, correct?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. All right, and ChemRisk is a company that is
[20]owned by Dennis Paustenbach, is that correct?
[21]A. Yes. It was -- it was owned by Dennis
[22]Paustenbach.
[23]Q. Okay, and is it Dr. Paustenbach?
[24]A. Yes, yes.
[25]Q. Dr. Paustenbach was at ChemRisk in -- from 2012
  Page 18
[1]to 2014 when you were there, correct?
[2]A. Yes. He formed the company in 2003, I believe,
[3]and he sold that company at the end of 2012, so he was
[4]still with -- with Cardno ChemRisk once they purchased
[5]the ChemRisk entity.
[6]Q. And to your knowledge, he's still with them to
[7]this day, is he not?
[8]A. No, I -- I don't think he is.
[9]Q. Okay, and what -- why did you decide to leave
[10]from Cardno ChemRisk and go to Exponent?
[11]A. I decided that Exponent would be a better
[12]long-term choice with the style of -- of work I wanted
[13]to perform.
[14]Q. And why was that? Why were they a better
[15]choice than Cardno ChemRisk?
[16]A. Well, I liked the more diverse engineering and
[17]health sciences umbrella, the larger firm that -- that
[18]basically does related or complimentary services and has
[19]a lot more resources than what the ChemRisk entity had
[20]and/or the Cardno ChemRisk entity.
[21]So, I was looking to be, you know, among a
[22]broader breadth of expertise among my colleagues and a
[23]better structure and I think a better quality
[24]recognition name for Exponent compared to Cardno.
[25]Q. And while you were at Cardno ChemRisk you were
  Page 19
[1]providing expert witness services then, as well,
[2]correct?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. Prior to that, you were an individual
[5]toxicology consultant with Health Service Resource
[6]Integration, is that correct?
[7]A. No, it's Health Science Resource Integration,
[8]but yes, that was my independent consulting company,
[9]Inc.
[10]Q. Okay. So you -- so, you owned Health Science
[11]Resource Integration, Inc. from 1997 to 2012, is that
[12]correct?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. Okay. Did you have any other employees besides
[15]yourself?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. And what type of work did you perform as an
[18]independent toxicology consultant?
[19]A. I did a diversity of work consistent with what
[20]I did before and after that, but probably, more
[21]participation in doing independent peer review or
[22]consultations for government entities or things that
[23]might be more of a conflict for the larger company work
[24]I had done previously.
[25]Q. And prior to that you were the managing
  Page 20
[1]principal health scientist at McClaren Heart in the
[2]ChemRisk division.
[3]Is that -- did I get that right?
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. And that was 1992 to 1997, correct?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. And so, we see the name, ChemRisk, again. Did
[8]that -- is that a division that got spun off and
[9]ultimately became the company owned by Dr. Paustenbach?
[10]A. Well, no, not spun off, but it was associated
[11]with Paustenbach.
[12]It was blended into McClaren Heart, which was a
[13]large engineering firm, somewhere in the '80s, I
[14]believe, and then, McClaren Heart, as I understand,
[15]went -- went bankrupt sometime in '98 or '99. The
[16]entity went into kind of a bankruptcy situation.
[17]I think Paustenbach somehow liberated it from
[18]that -- that bankruptcy situation.
[19]Q. So, Dr. Paustenbach would have been at
[20]McClaren Heart from 1992 to 1997 while you were there as
[21]the managing principal health scientist, correct?
[22]A. I'm pretty sure it was, at least, through '96,
[23]and then he made a transition out, and then, ultimately,
[24]to Exponent, as far as I recall, and I left the next --
[25]the following year or within months after he had
  Page 21
[1]departed McClaren Heart.
[2]Q. And what were your responsibilities as a
[3]managing principal health scientist during that time?
[4]A. The same thing I described that I'm doing
[5]currently, basically just managing, bringing in
[6]projects, managing project, managing staff, managing the
[7]business aspects.
[8]Q. And then, prior to that, '88 to '92 you were
[9]senior toxicologist -- and -- and I'm just reading
[10]your -- your CV -- senior toxicologist, toxicological
[11]evaluations, research and risk assessment.
[12]Where were you -- who were you doing those jobs
[13]for at that time?
[14]A. I'm sorry, I'm not sure I know what you're
[15]asking.
[16]Q. That's all right. Let me try to ask a better
[17]question.
[18]I'm looking here, under your prior experience.
[19]It says from '88 to '92 you were a senior toxicologist.
[20]Who were you working for at that time?
[21]A. Well, the -- the abbreviation is Tera,
[22]Incorporated, and it's the firm that my -- one of my
[23]graduate -- graduate school major advisors, Ralph James,
[24]had formed, and -- after I graduated from my Ph.D.
[25]degree I worked for them, first, in Little Rock,
  Page 22
[1]Arkansas, and then, subsequently, in Tallahassee,
[2]Florida.
[3]Q. And what were you doing prior to 1988?
[4]A. Well, 199 -- 1985 to '88, I was getting my
[5]degree in toxicology, and then, prior to that, I worked
[6]for a couple of years as a research chemist at Florida
[7]State University. Then before that, it was my college
[8]time.
[9]Q. During your time from '88 to '92, were you
[10]doing any work with Dr. Paustenbach at that time?
[11]A. No.
[12]Q. So, the first time you started doing any work
[13]with Dr. Paustenbach was in 1992, is that correct?
[14]A. I believe so.
[15]Q. All right. As it relates, specifically, to
[16]metal-on-metal hip implants and/or resurfacing, other
[17]than the work order that's at the center of this
[18]deposition, which is the BHR resurfacing, have you done
[19]any work in the past for any metal-on-metal hip or hip
[20]resurfacing companies?
[21]A. Yeah. I worked for the consulting firm that
[22]those consulting firms have -- have worked for other
[23]companies, yes.
[24]Q. And which companies have you performed the
[25]services for that relate to metal-on-metal hip implants
  Page 23
[1]or resurfacing?
[2]A. Well, the work that I was doing, mainly in a
[3]research capacity, at ChemRisk and Cardno ChemRisk,
[4]much -- most of that or all of that, in essence, was for
[5]Johnson & Johnson DePuy entity.
[6]Q. And that research, was it related to specific
[7]products from DePuy?
[8]A. Yes, the metal-on-metal hip implants.
[9]Q. And would that include ASR?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. And did it include Pinnacle?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. And what type of work were you doing what
[14]specific work were you doing for J&J at that time?
[15]A. I was doing research relating to the wear
[16]debris and cobalt chromium health effects.
[17]Q. And were you working on this research with
[18]Dr. Paustenbach at the time?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. And was part of that research the studies that
[21]Dr. Paustenbach performed on himself where he would
[22]ingest cobalt?
[23]A. I don't know.
[24]The way you're characterized it, I'm -- I don't
[25]really understand, but there were a series of clinical
  Page 24
[1]exam -- clinical studies that had an institutional
[2]review boards and very formal protocols that involved
[3]cobalt chloride oral -- basically, vitamin intake -- for
[4]different periods of time.
[5]Both myself and Dr. Paustenbach, and several
[6]other individuals in the company participated in
[7]those -- in those pharmacokinetic studies.
[8]Q. Other than your work that you were doing for
[9]Johnson & Johnson while you were at Cardno ChemRisk, any
[10]other work that you've performed over the years for
[11]metal-on-metal implant or resurfacing companies?
[12]A. No, not me directly.
[13]I've done some peer review for others in the
[14]company, at Exponent, that were -- that were doing
[15]projects or reports concerning other -- other hip
[16]implants.
[17]Q. Do you recall which hip implants those were?
[18]A. I -- I can't really reveal that because it's
[19]not really my projects, and it would be a confidential
[20]client, the company, but it was other -- other
[21]metal-on-metal hip implant producers.
[22]Q. So, while an employee at Exponent you did peer
[23]review for other employees of Exponent who were working
[24]on research projects related to metal-on-metal hip
[25]implants and/or resurfacing products.
  Page 25
[1]Am I understanding that correctly?
[2]A. I'm not sure whether I'd call it research
[3]projects, but again, my -- my expertise in -- in cobalt
[4]and chromium toxicology was already established, so
[5]within the context of the ISO 9000 peer review
[6]requirements, I'm kind of a go-to person to review or
[7]provide additional input from quality perspective for
[8]anybody else who's working on the health aspects of --
[9]of cobalt -- cobalt chromium alloy implants.
[10]So, it's not -- again, I'm -- it's not that I'm
[11]in there developing opinions it's me being a peer
[12]reviewer of existing expert reports and opinions. But
[13]that's what I do.
[14]Whether they do it in a research context or in
[15]a litigation support or expert report context, it
[16]doesn't matter. My role is kind of the same, just to
[17]make sure that it's -- you know, what the information is
[18]saying is accurate and correct according to my
[19]expertise.
[20]Q. The peer review function that you performed for
[21]these other employees of Exponent, whether it was
[22]research or a litigation based project that they were
[23]working on, have there been any published studies as a
[24]result of that work they were doing, specifically, to
[25]metal-on-metal hip implants or resurfacing?
  Page 26
[1]A. I don't really know how to answer that.
[2]I -- I've published nine different papers on
[3]cobalt, cobalt toxicology and/or relating to cobalt
[4]chromium alloys or implants over the years. Some of it
[5]was carried over from Exponent coming from Cardno
[6]ChemRisk and then some of it was just collaboration with
[7]colleagues at Exponent.
[8]The more recent stuff that I've done at
[9]Exponent has not been related to -- to client work or --
[10]or not -- not paid for by client funds.
[11]Q. Okay. What -- what I'm trying to find out is,
[12]at Exponent, is Exponent doing any work or have they
[13]done any work for metal-on-metal hip manufacturers that
[14]would not be subject to a confidentiality issue, that
[15]you can tell me what manufacturers those are?
[16]A. Well, other than my own work, I'm not -- I
[17]don't recall anything that I can comment on with respect
[18]to that.
[19]The company works in a diversity of capacities
[20]in both biomedical engineering aspects as well as in
[21]health aspects and I'm not -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't
[22]have a need necessarily to -- to be aware or utilize a
[23]lot of the work that might have gotten published in
[24]other fields that are not directly related to mine, so I
[25]can't answer that. I don't know and don't have the
  Page 27
[1]grasp of the whole company's activities publication-wise
[2]of implants.
[3]Q. Well, as we sit here right now we know that,
[4]obviously, you've performed work for Smith & Nephew for
[5]metal-on-metal and/or re surfacing matters.
[6]To the best of your knowledge, as you sit here
[7]today, has Exponent provided any service to any
[8]manufacturer of a metal-on-metal hip or re surfacing
[9]product, to the best of your knowledge?
[10]A. I'm sure they -- they have. I just can't talk
[11]about it because it's not -- it's company confidential
[12]as far as clients, and I didn't participate in it so
[13]it's not -- it's not something I can comment on in a
[14]meaningful way.
[15]MR. MATHEWS: And Cami, are you instructing him
[16]not to answer the question?
[17]MS. CAPODICE: To the extent that it is
[18]confidential within Exponent, yes, I am.
[19]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[20]Q. All right. When were you retained by -- well,
[21]when were you retained to perform services as it relates
[22]to the BHR resurfacing litigation that we're here to
[23]talk about today?
[24]A. I think it was in the beginning of this year.
[25]Q. Beginning of --
  Page 28
[1]A. I'm sorry.
[2]Q. I'm sorry.
[3]A. Yeah, so, to be clear I worked on another
[4]Smith & Nephew matter sometime in 2017 or '18, and that
[5]ended within a month or two, and then we were hired on
[6]this MDL matter. I believe, it was early February is
[7]when they signed the authorization.
[8]Q. 2017 or '18, what work were you doing for
[9]Smith & Nephew at that time?
[10]A. I did an expert report in the -- I think it was
[11]call the McAnany case.
[12]Q. Do you recall if that was a total hip
[13]replacement or a resurfacing case?
[14]A. I think that was a THR. I'm pretty sure but
[15]I'm not positive.
[16]Q. And you said that ended within a month or two.
[17]How long from point of contact until you were
[18]done testifying in the matter did that last?
[19]A. Well, I don't have -- I didn't review the
[20]records on that but my recollection is that from the
[21]start of me being involved in that case till the expert
[22]report, it was a couple of months, and then, after that,
[23]it either settled or went into hiatus and did not -- did
[24]not return, so I assumed it got settled.
[25]But that's what my recollection is.
  Page 29
[1]Q. Do you recall how much you were paid for your
[2]services at that time for the McAnany case?
[3]A. Do you mean, how many hours I billed or my
[4]billing rate is?
[5]Q. Either way.
[6]How was either your hours billed or the total
[7]amount of compensation you charged Smith & Nephew for
[8]the services?
[9]A. I -- I don't have a record of that. I don't
[10]recall.
[11]Q. And do you recall what your opinion was in that
[12]case?
[13]A. You know, I looked at it a long time ago,
[14]probably, towards the beginning of this year, so -- but
[15]I -- I don't recall what the specific issues were.
[16]But in general, I'm hired on these cases
[17]because of my expertise regarding cobalt and chromium,
[18]and so the scope would have been not -- not unlike
[19]what -- what I've done in this case in terms of
[20]evaluating what the science means in terms of claims of
[21]injury from wear debris in cobalt and chromium clients
[22]released from those -- from that wear debris.
[23]Q. Would your opinion in that case have supported
[24]Smith & Nephew's position that the cobalt and chromium
[25]release did not cause the injury in that case?
  Page 30
[1]A. Probably, yes.
[2]Q. And do you recall who hired you in that case?
[3]A. I don't remember.
[4]Q. Okay. Do you recall was it the defense lawyers
[5]who hired you in that case?
[6]A. Oh, so, the firm -- I think it was the Irwin
[7]Fritchie but I don't remember which lawyers it was that
[8]first contacted.
[9]I know Ms. Capodice was the -- was one of the
[10]lawyers that I worked with on that.
[11]Q. And I realize I've been asking some generalized
[12]questions, and so I apologize for that.
[13]Whenever I say, you were hired, it's really
[14]they hire Exponent, and you work on whatever you've been
[15]asked to perform, is that correct?
[16]A. Yes, and I -- I take it both ways.
[17]Usually, it's my name on the retention letter,
[18]the retention agreement, but it's Exponent that I work
[19]for.
[20]Q. And it's Exponent who invoices that work to be
[21]performed?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. And is it the law firm that is the client or is
[24]it the manufacturer, in this instance which would be
[25]Smith & Nephew?
  Page 31
[1]A. Well, that -- that can vary, but I understand
[2]in this case it's the manufacturer, Smith & Nephew.
[3]MR. MATHEWS: And I'm sure it's on our end, so
[4]I apologize, but I haven't actually seen the
[5]retention agreement so that why I'm asking these
[6]questions. I know you've got it there with you
[7]today.
[8]And Cami, was that something that's been
[9]previously provided?
[10]MS. CAPODICE: Yes. I think it was sent out
[11]last Monday or Tuesday.
[12]MR. MATHEWS: Okay, no worries.
[13]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[14]Q. So, in this case, you were contacted in
[15]February of 2020.
[16]Do you recall who contacted you, initially?
[17]A. It was Ms. Capodice.
[18]Q. And from 2017 or '18 -- I won't hold you to the
[19]specific date -- until February 2020, had you done any
[20]other work for Smith & Nephew during that time?
[21]A. No, not that I recall.
[22]Q. Same question, but as to Exponent, do you know
[23]if Exponent did noted work any work for Smith & Nephew
[24]from 2017 to February 2020?
[25]A. I know that Smith & Nephew have been a client
  Page 32
[1]of -- of our Philadelphia office staff for quite
[2]sometime.
[3]So, I did not track that but my assumption is
[4]during that time they did do work for Smith & Nephew.
[5]Q. And if you know, did -- did they do work
[6]specifically related to metal-on-metal hip products?
[7]A. I have -- again, I have not tracked that so I
[8]don't know that specifically.
[9]Q. Okay. Other than the retention agreement that
[10]you have there in front of you, do you have any other
[11]sort of formal agreements with Smith & Nephew at this
[12]time?
[13]A. No, not that I know of.
[14]Q. Other than providing litigation expert witness
[15]services in the BHR MDL, have you been asked to perform
[16]any other services for Smith & Nephew since February
[17]2020?
[18]A. You mean, under a separate project or -- what
[19]do you mean?
[20]Q. Yes. Yes, under a separate project.
[21]A. No, not that I recall.
[22]Q. Other than -- well, let me ask you this.
[23]Your work in the BHR MDL, is it limited to the
[24]BHR resurfacing cases or have you been asked to perform
[25]services in the THR track cases as well?
  Page 33
[1]A. I don't know -- I don't know how to distinguish
[2]that. You'd have to have to ask Ms. Capodice if she did
[3]any -- if she gave me any tasks relating to that.
[4]I'm not sure how I would discern that.
[5]Q. Okay, and that was going to be kind of my next
[6]question is, what are the tasks you've been asked to
[7]provide as it relates to the MDL litigation?
[8]A. Well, I was asked to develop a report, a
[9]comprehensive report, on the toxicology issues that I've
[10]researched over years pertaining to cobalt, chromium and
[11]the cobalt chromium alloy wear debris focused on -- on
[12]toxicology and all the central issues regarding
[13]systemic -- mainly systemic toxicity relating to -- to
[14]wear debris from metal-on-metal hip implants.
[15]Q. And that last part was maybe what I'm trying to
[16]get at.
[17]Was it as to metal-on-metal hip implants in
[18]general or was it as to, specifically, the resurfacing
[19]products?
[20]A. Well, both, both. Specifically, the
[21]resurfacing the BHR, as well as other knowledge from
[22]metal-on-metal implants from other manufacturers whether
[23]it was resurfacing or total hip replacements.
[24]Q. During these services you've provided since
[25]February of 2020, have you conducted any testing of your
  Page 34
[1]own on metal-on-metal on metal hip implants?
[2]A. You mean, like, experimental work?
[3]Q. I'm sorry. Yes, in-lab experimental work.
[4]A. No.
[5]Q. Have you met with any Smith & Nephew employees
[6]during that time, and by, met, in this day of COVID, I
[7]mean, you know, in person, on the phone, via Zoom,
[8]through email communications?
[9]Have you had any communication with any
[10]Smith & Nephew employees since you were hired?
[11]A. No, not that I recall.
[12]Q. And what did you do to prepare for today's
[13]deposition?
[14]A. Well, I read through my report a few times, had
[15]a few calls with Ms. Capodice over the last couple of
[16]weeks and just refamiliarized myself with the broad
[17]scope of research that's summarized in my report.
[18]MR. MATHEWS: Okay. I think we're up to
[19]Exhibit 3, is that right?
[20]MS. CAPODICE: That's what I have.
[21]THE COURT REPORTER: Yes, Exhibit 3.
[22](Plaintiff's Exhibit 3, marked for
[23]identification)
[24]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[25]Q. And let me show you -- I'm moving to the
  Page 35
[1]invoices that we received in this case.
[2]I will tell you, I have it as a total of
[3]19 pages, and it runs from May the 1st through
[4]October of -- October 8th of 2020 is what I have.
[5]MS. CAPODICE: Just for the record, we sent one
[6]additional invoice last week along with the
[7]retention agreement.
[8]MR. MATHEWS: Got it. Okay.
[9]THE WITNESS: The other one was from March,
[10]March 19th, 2020.
[11]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[12]Q. And so, your first bill in this case would have
[13]been March 19, 2020?
[14]Is that what your records are showing?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. All right -- and again, I apologize because I
[17]don't have it all in front of me -- when you say that's
[18]your first bill, is that the first date of invoice or
[19]that the first date service was provided and billed for?
[20]A. That's the invoice date. I --
[21]Q. Okay. On that invoice -- I'm sorry.
[22]A. I didn't really do much work until -- yeah, and
[23]the bill I -- I mean, I did a .4 hours of -- 20 minutes
[24]or so of work on February 7th in that March 19th
[25]invoice, and then the next invoice, I did a total of
  Page 36
[1]5 -- 5.1 hours in the month of April.
[2]So, first couple of months were not --
[3]Q. And then since October the 8th -- sorry --
[4]Doctor, I've got a glitch on my end so I apologize if
[5]I'm talking over you. I don't mean to.
[6]A. Okay.
[7]Q. Since -- can you tell me, since your bill of
[8]October the 8th, how much time have you spent?
[9]A. So, in the month of October, I -- don't recall
[10]exactly, but probably, maybe, a couple of days worth of
[11]time as far as for this -- this deposition, and then
[12]the -- I don't remember when the prior deposition that
[13]got rescheduled occurred, but I had done some studying
[14]prior to the previous one, which I think was in early --
[15]early October or mid-October is my recollection.
[16]So, yeah, I wouldn't expect more than a couple
[17]of days of time since -- in the month of October.
[18]Q. So, maybe, 16 hours?
[19]A. Yeah, I would -- that's my approximation. I
[20]don't have the exact numbers but that's about right.
[21]Q. Okay, and you charge about $ 400 -- you charge
[22]$ 400 an hour, correct?
[23]A. Exponent charges $ 400 an hour for my time,
[24]that's right.
[25]MS. CAPODICE: Todd, are we getting close to a
  Page 37
[1]breaking point?
[2]MR. MATHEWS: Yeah. Let me -- let me just
[3]finish this up just so we'll be -- if that's okay
[4]with you.
[5]MS. CAPODICE: Absolutely fine.
[6]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[7]Q. So, I had in -- in my documents, at least,
[8]about $ 85,000 of bills.
[9]We don't have the October invoice or I don't
[10]have it in front of me, and I'm missing, at least, the
[11]first one.
[12]Would it be fair to say that Exponent has
[13]charged Smith & Nephew approximately a hundred thousand
[14]dollars up to this point, as we sit here for the
[15]deposition today?
[16]A. No, it's not -- I don't think it's that much.
[17]The first invoice you're talking about was $ 160
[18]and then 16 hours of my time, it's not -- it's not that
[19]much.
[20]So, you know, I'd say under -- under 90,000 is
[21]kind of the sum total, as I -- as I understand.
[22]MR. MATHEWS: Okay. All right, we can take a
[23]break now, Cami, if you want to.
[24]MS. CAPODICE: Okay. Thank you so much.
[25]MR. MATHEWS: Sure.

[1]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record 10:01.
[2](Recess taken)
[3](After recess)
[4]THE VIDEOGRAPHER:. Back on the video record
[5]10:11.
[6]MR. MATHEWS: All right. Let me figure out how
[7]to work this again. Hang on. Sorry.
[8]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[9]Q. All right, Doctor, let me go back and clean up
[10]a few things from the last hour.
[11]How many times have you served as an expert
[12]witness in the past?
[13]A. In the past, you mean, ever?
[14]Q. Yes, and I'm not looking for an exact number.
[15]A. Many times.
[16]Q. Would it be fair to say more than a hundred
[17]times?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. And I know you provided a list at the back of
[20]your CV of current cases or cases you've served as an
[21]expert witness in since 2016.
[22]Is that list accurate as far as deposition and
[23]trial testimony goes?
[24]A. Yes. I -- I had one additional deposition,
[25]that would be number 18 on that list, since I released
  Page 39
[1]that one.
[2]Q. And that was deposition testimony?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. And do you recall the name of the case?
[5]A. It was Nicki Monsel versus CHR Hansen.
[6]Q. And where was that case pending?
[7]A. Circuit court of Wisconsin in Milwaukee County.
[8]Q. And what type of case is that?
[9]A. That was regarding health effects of
[10]flavorings.
[11]Q. Of what? I'm sorry.
[12]A. Flavorings.
[13]Q. Okay, and do you recall about when that
[14]deposition occurred?
[15]A. It was after August, between August and now,
[16]after August 28th when I generated this report, and I
[17]think it was in early October or late September, is my
[18]recollection.
[19]Q. And you were testifying on behalf of the
[20]defendant in that case?
[21]A. One of the defendants, yes.
[22]Q. Over the last -- well, the time you've been at
[23]Exponent what percentage of your expert witness work has
[24]been performed for defendants as opposed to plaintiffs?
[25]A. The vast majority of clients that I get,
  Page 40
[1]working for Exponent, are defense individuals.
[2]Q. Okay. In the last five, almost six years, of
[3]working at Exponent, when was the last time you provided
[4]expert witness services for an individual who has been
[5]physically -- alleges physical harm from a -- a
[6]defendant's product?
[7]A. So, by expert witness services, what do you
[8]mean? Do you mean, deposition or trial?.
[9]Q. Yes.
[10]A. And again, you've framed it pretty
[11]specifically. I'm not sure how to -- how to answer
[12]that.
[13]I don't recall anything, specifically,
[14]regarding a defective product, but I did testify for the
[15]plaintiffs, in a case that's on my list, last year.
[16]Q. Which one was that?
[17]A. Number 10.
[18]Q. Eric Nelson versus Ace High Tavern, is that
[19]correct?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. And what type of case was that?
[22]A. That was a -- an alcohol intoxication battery
[23]case.
[24]Q. And you testified on behalf of Mr. Hansen?
[25]A. Mr. Nelson.
  Page 41
[1]Q. I'm sorry. Mr. Nelson. I apologize.
[2]A. That's right.
[3]Q. And were you giving an opinion on Mr. Nelson's
[4]level of alcohol in his system at the time of the
[5]incident?
[6]A. Partly.
[7]Q. Other than Mr. Nelson, have you testified on
[8]behalf of any other plaintiffs during your time at
[9]Exponent?
[10]A. Testifying, meaning, in deposition or trial?.
[11]Q. Yes.
[12]A. Not that I recall.
[13]Q. Would it be fair to say that Exponent, as a
[14]whole, the vast majority of expert witness services that
[15]they provide are for industry, meaning, manufacturers of
[16]products, companies that are in lawsuits alleging that
[17]their actions have harmed someone else or someone else's
[18]property?
[19]A. I -- I can't answer that for the whole company.
[20]You know, you'd have to get somebody else to do that.
[21]I'm only familiar with what I do and not in terms of any
[22]reasonable specifics.
[23]Q. As a shareholder at Exponent, do you attend
[24]yearly shareholder meetings?
[25]A. I'm -- I'm not a significant shareholder.
  Page 42
[1]No, I -- I mean, I guess I could because I do
[2]own some stock, but that's, you know, a tiny, tiny,
[3]fraction of what the company -- the stock issue, you
[4]know, overall, is my understanding.
[5]So, no, I don't participate in that.
[6]Q. As a principal scientist with Exponent, do you,
[7]from time to time, have meetings at Exponent wherein the
[8]activities and health of the company, financial health
[9]of the company, in general, is discussed?
[10]A. Sure. Yes.
[11]Q. And during those discussions, has it ever been
[12]made or have statements ever been made by the executives
[13]that the vast majority of expert witness services
[14]provided by Exponent are on behalf of corporations and
[15]companies that are being sued by plaintiffs?
[16]A. I don't -- I don't recall anything of that
[17]specific nature.
[18]Our company is divided into areas of expertise
[19]and each area of expertise -- like, for example, I'm in
[20]the health group and there might be a buildings and
[21]structures group, you know, a whole group of principals
[22]in that group, and there might be, also, you know, the
[23]heating, the thermal group, and the chemistry group,
[24]chemistry and polymers.
[25]Each -- each entity within the company, of
  Page 43
[1]which there are about ten, has a different expertise, a
[2]different set of clients and a different mix of what
[3]might be either regulatory or -- or litigation work.
[4]We're not, you know, a hired gun only.
[5]And the expertise, again, that we provide,
[6]doesn't always fall under litigation.
[7]So, I can't answer that broadly as you might
[8]want me to.
[9]But we have a diversity of expertise, and each
[10]niche -- niche of expertise has a different mix, as I
[11]understand it, in terms of what would be litigation or
[12]expert witness service participation.
[13]Q. And did you categorize your department as
[14]health science?
[15]A. That's the -- the umbrella that I'm under as
[16]far as the main -- the highest level of categorical
[17]expertise, yes.
[18]Q. And can -- can you tell me, under that umbrella
[19]of health science, do you have knowledge that the vast
[20]majority of expert witness services provided under
[21]health science is on behalf of defendants who are being
[22]sued by plaintiff alleging that the defendant's product
[23]or actions have caused them harm?
[24]A. I -- I don't really have specific knowledge of
[25]that -- at that level for the whole health group.
  Page 44
[1]Our health group is divided in the chemical --
[2]chemical regulation group, which is mainly centered in
[3]Europe and involves mainly product stewardship,
[4]toxicology in relation to regulatory registrations for
[5]products. That's about half of the health group, and I
[6]don't think they do any litigation.
[7]And then the other half is -- is the toxicology
[8]center, which is my expertise.
[9]And in that group, again, there's a mixture of
[10]people who do proactive consulting work in their
[11]expertise, which might include epidemiology, toxicology
[12]and related areas or like me, I do, mainly, litigation
[13]work or research pertaining to high -- high liability
[14]issues that might not be involved in litigation but
[15]could.
[16]Q. Under your, I guess, subumbrella of toxicology,
[17]on the expert witness side, how many other principal
[18]scientists are under -- under that subumbrella?
[19]A. I don't really have an accurate count in my
[20]mind but I'd say there's -- between 10 and 20, is my
[21]best estimate.
[22]Q. And if you know, as to those 10 or 20, would it
[23]be fair to say that the 10 or 20 expert witnesses --
[24]MR. MATHEWS: Let me ask you a different
[25]question.
  Page 45
[1]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[2]Q. Do all of those principal scientists serve as
[3]expert witnesses?
[4]A. Again, I don't really -- I can't give you
[5]breakdowns. I'm not even sure that 10 to 20 is
[6]accurate, but that's my best estimate.
[7]Again, what we do -- I'm not sure what you're
[8]after here -- what we do is high liability work at a
[9]fairly high quality billing rate, so we don't get hired
[10]for just testifying.
[11]We get hired to do research and work for
[12]companies that can pay our bills.
[13]So, in general, the clientele for me and for
[14]others like me at Exponent, is corporate entities or
[15]could be a government entity, it could be a commercial
[16]distributor client, any number of different types of --
[17]of clientele that need the level of expertise that we
[18]have and are able to pay for that level of expertise
[19]which inherently involves research, and you know,
[20]quality report preparation like here.
[21]Q. Let me -- let me focus my questions, maybe, a
[22]little more directly on just what you do.
[23]As far as -- I know the amount of money you
[24]make is confidential, but as far as the amount of work
[25]you do on a yearly basis, what percentage of that is
  Page 46
[1]related to expert witness service as opposed to
[2]something else?
[3]A. So, I don't know how you define expert witness
[4]service, but --
[5]Q. Well, let me -- let me, maybe, try and define
[6]it and that might help us with our conversation.
[7]So, I would define expert witness service as
[8]testifying; preparing to testify; doing research to
[9]generate reports; writing reports; going to court;
[10]waiting around at court until it's time to testify;
[11]traveling to depositions or court, which I know we're
[12]not doing a lot of right now; any studies that you
[13]conduct in preparation for performing your expert
[14]witness services as generating reports or preparing to
[15]testify.
[16]Basically, anything that you do in preparation
[17]for testifying at trial or giving a deposition would be
[18]something I would consider expert witness service.
[19]Anything else, would be, you're hired by a
[20]company to do tests on some toxicology issue that's not
[21]the subject of litigation.
[22]A. Okay. Can you repeat what your specific
[23]question was, again, please?
[24]Q. So, what percentage of your time, on a yearly
[25]basis, is spent on expert witness service work as
  Page 47
[1]opposed to anything else?
[2]A. That varies from month to month and from year
[3]to year, because, in some cases, I'm hired on projects
[4]that are in more of the environmental risk assessment
[5]realm or in a research realm, again, answering deep
[6]scientific questions that don't center on litigation,
[7]but rather, on regulatory or kind of proactive company
[8]research issues.
[9]So, it varies from year to year depending on
[10]what my engagements are, because like, again, I do
[11]research.
[12]Whether it goes towards ultimately preparing a
[13]report or preparing for deposition testimony, it doesn't
[14]matter to me. That research, that element, can be
[15]significant to me, months out of the year, depending on
[16]my -- my project load.
[17]But the vast majority of work on average that I
[18]do is research in relation to the chemical toxicology
[19]questions pertaining to litigation is what I do.
[20]Litigation work is the vast majority of what I do.
[21]Q. All right, and I won't hold you to an exact
[22]percentage but we keep using this vast majority
[23]vernacular. Does that mean something -- 80 percent of
[24]your time is spent? Would that be a vast majority or
[25]what is a vast majority in your mind?
  Page 48
[1]A. Yeah, I'd say, at least, 60 percent on -- in
[2]any given year.
[3]Q. How many on average again -- because every year
[4]is different, but on average, how many new litigation
[5]matters do you open a year?
[6]And I may be using legal vernacular now.
[7]How many new litigation engagements do you open
[8]or are generated where you sign a contract on a new
[9]piece of litigation per year, on average?
[10]A. I don't think I've ever tried to quantify that,
[11]but again, it varies from year to year depending on what
[12]the intensity of work I have is on a given project and
[13]on the existing projects and then, also, what
[14]opportunities come along.
[15]So, there's small and large projects. You
[16]know, small projects, I can -- you know, I can do 20 or
[17]30 small projects comfortably in a year whereas large
[18]projects, you know, I might only have enough time for
[19]three or four in a year. So, I don't have a number.
[20]I get retained in new matters multiple times
[21]each month and I have an ongoing work of active and
[22]inactive projects.
[23]I have a list of potential projects, some of
[24]which are inactive that might include 20 or 30 different
[25]jobs that are active, ongoing.
  Page 49
[1]Q. How many -- because I don't know how Exponent
[2]is set up, you're the principal scientist and you've
[3]kind of laid out those requirements or responsibilities,
[4]how many people do you have working under you?
[5]A. I only have one person that I supervise and
[6]that's Ann Locosano, but I utilize a number of people
[7]within the health group for different capabilities.
[8]But I'm only kind of responsible for keeping
[9]Ann busy.
[10]Q. And what is -- what's Ann's title or role?
[11]A. Ann is a managing scientist at Exponent. She's
[12]a Ph.D. chemist and board-certified toxicologist.
[13]Q. And then it sounds like she, then, has
[14]managerial responsibilities over other folks there in
[15]the -- in Exponent?
[16]A. No. She's more of a project manager, but she
[17]can manage staff.
[18]Just like I manage her time under certain
[19]projects she has that authority to manage staff and
[20]projects.
[21]Q. Okay. If you could tell me, how many people
[22]are in the health sciences department, if you will, at
[23]Exponent?
[24]A. You know, I don't have an accurate count of
[25]that.
  Page 50
[1]Like I said, half -- half of the health group
[2]is in -- in Europe, mainly, in the UK, in the chemical
[3]regulation group, and they've grown substantially even
[4]during COVID, so I don't have an exact number.
[5]I'd say there's probably more than a hundred
[6]people in Europe and close to or more than a hundred
[7]people in the health group in the United States.
[8]Q. And Exponent's main location is in California,
[9]correct?
[10]A. Yes, the corporate office is in Menlo Park.
[11]Q. And is that where most of the employees are?
[12]A. No.
[13]Q. Where are they?
[14]A. Well, you can look on the website to identify
[15]all the offices.
[16]There's -- there's a number of east coast
[17]offices, a number of west coast offices, there's Europe,
[18]UK offices, and some in the middle of the country.
[19]Q. Well, let me ask you a better question.
[20]The folks that you have access to that do work
[21]for you from time to time under the health services
[22]umbrella, are they located in one location?
[23]A. No. Most everybody is located at home these
[24]days, but Ann is -- is working out of the -- what would
[25]be Alexandria office that's open, Alexandria, Virginia.
  Page 51
[1]And then, the main toxicology people that I use
[2]are, probably, Oakland, California, and Menlo Park would
[3]be the epidemiology expertise that I typically utilize.
[4]Q. Okay. I know I asked you earlier, I think
[5]earlier on in the deposition, if you could tell me the
[6]amount of revenue that's generated by Exponent that's
[7]related to litigation services as opposed to everything
[8]else, and I appreciate that you weren't able to tell me
[9]that.
[10]Would you agree that litigation services, as
[11]we've identified it, is a significant part of the
[12]revenue for Exponent?
[13]A. That's -- I think that's a reasonable
[14]expectation. I don't know, again, what -- what the
[15]quatification of it is, but a lot of work that we do,
[16]like I said, is, high liability, key issue work that can
[17]end up in litigation if it's not already.
[18]So, that's the nature of the work that we hold
[19]ourselves out to be able -- to be capable to do,
[20]exactly.
[21]MR. MATHEWS: And I'm going to attempt to share
[22]with you Exhibit -- are we up to Exhibit 4?
[23]THE COURT REPORTER: Yes, this is Exhibit 4.
[24]MS. CAPODICE: Right.
[25](Plaintiff's Exhibit 4, marked for
  Page 52
[1]identification)
[2]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[3]Q. All right, and Exhibit 4 is Exponent's 2019
[4]annual report that they provided, which is an obligation
[5]as a publicly-traded company.
[6]Have you seen their annual report prior to
[7]today?
[8]A. I -- I don't really pay attention to those.
[9]That's more of an investor profile document, as
[10]far as I understand. It's not something that I'm really
[11]that concerned about.
[12]Q. Would it surprise you to know that Exponent
[13]listed as one of the -- well, rather than -- I'll just
[14]show.
[15]On page 18 of this document -- this is under
[16]the section where -- I'm going to go up here just so you
[17]can see where it's at -- where they're talking about the
[18]challenges the company may face, and one of those things
[19]is -- on page 18, they list the PG&E bankruptcy, and one
[20]of the challenges might be that PG&E has gone bankrupt
[21]and wouldn't be able to pay.
[22]Would that surprise you, that that -- is that
[23]important that they put it in their 2019 annual report?
[24]A. Would it surprise me? Is that what you're
[25]asking?.
  Page 53
[1]Q. Yes.
[2]A. No, no. I mean, as I understand it, like, PG&E
[3]is a big client of the company in the energy and
[4]engineering relating to managing the grid, so to speak,
[5]and you know, the big fire, fire risk and the liability
[6]concerning powerline equipment failing and causing these
[7]giant fires that we've heard about in the news.
[8]And so, PG&E facing bankruptcy would be a huge
[9]issue with respect to the volume of work that we do for
[10]them and getting paid and investors -- again, this -- an
[11]annual report to investors talking about what risks
[12]there are to making profits.
[13]Whenever something like that happens to a major
[14]company that we work for we have to put that out so that
[15]there's a -- a known risk.
[16]Q. Are you aware of what the annual revenues were
[17]for Exponent last year in 2019?
[18]A. Again, I don't really pay attention to overall
[19]revenues, but yeah, I know they're listed in there.
[20]MR. MATHEWS: And you know, if I were better at
[21]working a computer I would be a computer person, so
[22]I apologize.
[23]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[24]Q. On page 23, I believe it is -- hang on. I
[25]apologize.
  Page 54
[1]Since I can find it, let me ask you this, would
[2]it surprise you that the net income for Exponent last
[3]year was $ 82 million?
[4]A. It doesn't surprise me, no.
[5]Q. Would it surprise you that the revenue for
[6]Exponent last year was $ 412 million?
[7]A. It says 417, but yeah.
[8]Q. 417?
[9]A. No. Again, we're a company of more than a
[10]thousand professionals across -- you know, the U.S. and
[11]in Europe, and so that's a big load of expertise and a
[12]lot of highly -- highly regarded people that bill at
[13]pretty substantial billing rates so that -- that's what
[14]that equates with.
[15]Q. Have you ever been hired by a defendant facing
[16]a lawsuit, have you ever been hired to conduct studies
[17]to arrive at a predetermined outcome?
[18]A. No, no. Again, sometimes, the question is
[19]around a claim to the positive or to the negative, you
[20]know, does it cause this or does -- is there a basis for
[21]this claim by another, you know, an opposing entity, and
[22]our research is not about coming to the opposing
[23]conclusion, it's about evaluating what the scientific
[24]literature does or doesn't support, and what the
[25]strengths and weaknesses of the -- of the weight of the
  Page 55
[1]scientific evidence would imply.
[2]So, it's not my job to support a position.
[3]It's my job to do independent research and advise what
[4]that -- what the science means.
[5]Q. Is it -- it is fair to say that since you've
[6]been with Exponent there have been engagements that
[7]after you have begun performing the task of litigation
[8]support, you've ultimately rejected that work or not
[9]continued to provide expert witness services?
[10]A. I don't recall that happening to me.
[11]Again, we -- before I take on a project, I
[12]will -- we'll do a conflict check and we'll have a
[13]number of you know, a certain number of scope
[14]conversations to make sure that it's work that we're
[15]willing to do, and that's within the scope of -- of
[16]expertise that we can offer.
[17]So, if I'm doing my job properly that will
[18]never happen, in other words, unless a conflict develops
[19]later, which is unusual and hasn't happen to me.
[20]Usually, what we are doing is carrying out what
[21]we expect to be a scope of work that does not create any
[22]problems for us.
[23]So, does that answer the question? I'm not --
[24]I wasn't quite --
[25]Q. Well, it does, and it leads me to the next
  Page 56
[1]question which is, so, in the last five or six years
[2]that you've been at Exponent, you haven't taken on any
[3]work for a defendant, that you got into the work and you
[4]realized, my opinion isn't going to be in line with what
[5]the defendant's position is and so I can no longer
[6]serves as an expert witness?
[7]A. I don't recall anything like that, no.
[8]Q. Certainly, if you --
[9]MR. MATHEWS: Well, strike that.
[10]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[11]Q. In this particular case, when did you learn
[12]that a report was going to be required?
[13]A. I -- I knew right away when Ms. Capodice had
[14]called me that this was going to require an expert
[15]report in my arena, again, because she was already
[16]familiar with my -- my publications, and I had written
[17]the report in the McAnany matter that she, also, worked
[18]on.
[19]So, the nature of this --
[20]Q. Other than the McAnany case, have you written
[21]any other reports -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Doctor. My
[22]computer paused and I didn't allow you to finish your
[23]answer. I'm sorry.
[24]A. Yeah, so, our initial conversations were in
[25]the -- in terms of scoping that I would have to provide
  Page 57
[1]an -- an initial expert report for this matter for MDL,
[2]and then, again, as I expect things proceed and they'll
[3]identify -- the guys will identify specific test
[4]plaintiffs that I can do more specific -- specific
[5]analysis of individual causation, disease causation
[6]issues or specific evidence.
[7]But my understanding, from the beginning, back
[8]in February, was that I would be creating -- creating an
[9]expert report that addressed the issues pertaining to
[10]toxicology of wear debris and cobalt chromium effects on
[11]the body.
[12]Q. Other than in the McAnany case and the report
[13]you generated for this case, have you created any
[14]reports for any other matters involving a metal-on-metal
[15]hip implant or a resurfacing product for any cases
[16]you've served as an expert witness in?
[17]A. At Exponent, are you talking about?
[18]Q. Well, let's start with Exponent. While at
[19]Exponent?
[20]A. No, I have not.
[21]Q. What about previous to being at Exponent? Did
[22]you do any expert reports on any metal-on-metal hip
[23]cases?
[24]A. Again, at Exponent or at Cardno ChemRisk, I
[25]participated in peer review of a number of expert
  Page 58
[1]reports, but not ones that were me held out as the
[2]expert, and the vast majority of my work in this arena
[3]has been in a research capacity, meaning, towards being
[4]able to put together a very coherent summary and
[5]analysis of the scientific literature pertaining to the
[6]toxicology and pharmacokinetics of cobalt and chromium
[7]in the -- in the context of metal-on-metal hip implants.
[8]So, I've done a lot of work in the arena but I
[9]don't recall doing any -- any expert report or testimony
[10]at Cardno ChemRisk in that arena.
[11]Q. I think this is a little bit different question
[12]than I've asked in the past but of those expert reports
[13]that you peer-reviewed, did any of those cases involve
[14]the testimony of the expert you were reviewing a report
[15]for?
[16]A. I don't understand the question.
[17]If I'm reviewing an expert report that is their
[18]testimony, in essence, correct?
[19]Q. Well, let me ask you -- let me tell you where
[20]I'm trying to go and then you can see if you can answer
[21]it.
[22]You -- you claimed some confidentiality earlier
[23]whenever I was asking about manufacturers and companies
[24]for peer review that you had done while at Exponent.
[25]What I'm trying to figure out is, any of these
  Page 59
[1]expert reports that you peer-reviewed, were they ever
[2]disseminated or was there ever public testimony provided
[3]on those at a depo or at a trial to where you could
[4]disclose the manufacturer that was represented in those
[5]cases?
[6]A. I don't know.
[7]The answer is, my work to do QC checks, an
[8]expert report ends with me providing comments to that
[9]individual, and whether it goes to deposition or trial,
[10]I don't -- I don't continue on, as you know, as a team
[11]member, so to speak, since the person who wrote the
[12]report takes over and does that work.
[13]So, again, my role is fairly -- fairly carved
[14]out and specific in the -- in the QC peer review role
[15]and I don't have knowledge of where it goes beyond
[16]that -- that step.
[17]Q. You're -- are you aware that Dr. Paustenbach
[18]provided expert witness services in the Pinnacle hip
[19]litigation?
[20]A. I don't know. My recollection is that the
[21]Pinnacle -- Pinnacle litigation work had not -- had not
[22]kind of been gone -- going forward by the time 2014,
[23]November, when I left Cardno.
[24]Dennis very well may have testified either
[25]before or after that, but again, I'm not -- I don't
  Page 60
[1]track all of his testimony activities.
[2]I know that most of the work that was -- that
[3]was going on, most of the litigation work that was going
[4]on was regarding the ASR implant in the 20''12 to 2014
[5]period. That's my recollection.
[6]Q. Okay, and the reason I asked, was my question
[7]was going to be, did you peer review any of his expert
[8]reports in the Pinnacle litigation?
[9]A. Not -- not that I recall, no.
[10]Q. And looking at your report that you did in this
[11]case, you've been fairly detailed in what you did to
[12]create the report.
[13]Are there any additions that, in reviewing for
[14]today, you thought needed to be made as to what you did
[15]to create the report?
[16]A. I -- no. I still believe that I've been
[17]comprehensive and transparent in providing what the --
[18]what the basis was for my opinions and all of the
[19]references are listed, as far as I know, at the top.
[20]It's comprehensive in terms of the list of
[21]actual published articles and other documents that I've
[22]reviewed.
[23]Q. The opinions that are contained in your report,
[24]are they complete opinions, as we sit here today?
[25]A. I'm not sure what -- what you mean by complete.
  Page 61
[1]Q. Do you have any new opinions that aren't
[2]contained in your expert report?
[3]A. I'm not sure how to answer that.
[4]I -- I don't -- I think there -- the -- the
[5]opinions I've expressed are reasonably comprehensive.
[6]They're not down to an individual or a specific
[7]causation level, which I expect to do once there would
[8]be actual test plaintiffs or representative plaintiffs
[9]identified and medical reports and other testimony or
[10]expert testimony revealed.
[11]But at this stage in the litigation, my whole
[12]review of opinions, I think it as complete as it needs
[13]to be and is reasonably comprehensive, so I don't have
[14]anything to add to it at this point.
[15]Q. Prior to providing this expert report, did
[16]anyone peer review the expert report for you?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. And do you recall who that was?
[19]A. Both Ann Locosano, who is my kind of lead --
[20]lead person, also, a toxicologist, board-certified, she
[21]reviewed it -- reviewed it just before we generated the
[22]final.
[23]And then Ellen Chang, who is an epidemiology
[24]principal in the Menlo Park office, she contributed
[25]comments, the QC comments to an earlier version of the
  Page 62
[1]report.
[2]Q. Did anybody outside of Exponent review the
[3]report for accuracy or to provide suggestions of changes
[4]prior to you submitting a report?
[5]MS. CAPODICE: I'm going to object to that
[6]question to the extent that it calls for attorney
[7]work product.
[8]Other than that, you can certainly answer.
[9]THE WITNESS: Yes, so the -- I allowed the
[10]attorneys to review my report using our client
[11]portal, FTP link, I think, on one or two occasions.
[12]And so, they've seen the report and then gave
[13]me -- they've given me some -- some limited comments
[14]but nothing substantive in my view. So, they were
[15]very happy with the report pretty much from the
[16]beginning.
[17]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[18]Q. So, other than the lawyers and the two Exponent
[19]employees you mentioned, did anyone else review the
[20]report prior to it being in its final presentation?
[21]A. Not in a technical capacity.
[22]We have an administrative assistants that look
[23]at the format and any references, et cetera, but in a
[24]technical capacity, that's it.
[25]Q. All right, so, nobody outside of Exponent
  Page 63
[1]reviewed your report prior to it getting in its final
[2]presentation state, correct?
[3]A. Right. Other than the lawyers, correct.
[4]Q. I apologize. Yes. All right.
[5]Have you ever actually seen a BHR hip
[6]resurfacing product?
[7]A. Well, I've seen pictures of it but I haven't
[8]handled one or physically touched one.
[9]Q. Okay. What about the other folks that you've
[10]mentioned who reviewed your report, have they, to your
[11]knowledge, ever seen or handled the BHR hip resurfacing
[12]product?
[13]A. I don't know. I -- I wouldn't expect so, but
[14]it might be.
[15]Q. When Ann Locosiano -- am I saying that right?
[16]A. Locosano, yep.
[17]Q. Locosano, okay.
[18]When she reviewed your report prior to it being
[19]in its final presentation state, what type of comments
[20]did she have, if you recall?
[21]A. She -- you know, she found some typos and other
[22]word problems. You know, It's quite a large report so
[23]there are usually little problems either with formatting
[24]or spelling or words that -- that tend to pop up. That
[25]was the nature of her work.
  Page 64
[1]She's not really an expert in -- in the -- in
[2]this arena, while she's a toxicologist but she's a
[3]pharmacokinetics expert so she's -- had reviewed it in
[4]that capacity, and then, Ellen Chang was the other one
[5]who -- she's like, I said, a principal epidemiologist,
[6]and she's got quite a good command of the -- of the
[7]epidemiology literature pertaining -- that I've reviewed
[8]in this report.
[9]Q. So, other than typos and some wordsmithing type
[10]issues, did either of them have any substantive changes
[11]to your report prior to it being in its final version?
[12]A. Well, I don't know what you mean by
[13]substantive, but it -- the way I interpret -- from the
[14]way things developed, basically, my report was a little
[15]bit longer, in -- in some ways redundant, and Ellen
[16]pointed that out to me, and so I focused it down, cut
[17]out some text to be able to kind of more clearly
[18]communicate the -- the key opinions and messages.
[19]But there wasn't anything that she told me
[20]that -- to change, in particular, about you know,
[21]whether this was right or this was wrong and stuff.
[22]So, substantive, in terms of focusing the
[23]thought, focusing the communication, I'd say, yes, Ellen
[24]helped me to -- to clarify and focus the document, but
[25]other than that, nothing, nothing that -- again, that
  Page 65
[1]would be a judgment call relating to toxicology or
[2]epidemiology, per se.
[3]Q. And I'll -- I'll admit that I have not seen the
[4]report you've given in the McAnany case.
[5]Is any of the report that you produced in this
[6]case just a cut and paste from the McAnany report?
[7]A. No, no, I don't think so.
[8]The McAnany report was much, again, more
[9]focused on specific causation and was much -- was much
[10]shorter.
[11]So, the scope of this report is intentionally
[12]broad, because, again, we're not talking about a
[13]specific individual so this is a much more comprehensive
[14]report in this case than was McAnany.
[15]Q. In creating this report did you look at any of
[16]the Smith & Nephew documents, actual documents from
[17]Smith & Nephew?
[18]A. What do you mean by documents?
[19]Q. Well, I don't mean studies that they may have
[20]provided you but actual internal documents from the
[21]corporation discussing the BHR product.
[22]Did you look at any of those?
[23]A. No. That really wasn't part of what I was
[24]asked to do.
[25]Q. Were there any materials that you requested
  Page 66
[1]from Smith & Nephew or their attorneys that you weren't
[2]provided?
[3]A. Not that I recall, no.
[4]Q. Okay, and you've -- you've mentioned it a
[5]couple of times and -- and I agree with you, this report
[6]is quite voluminous and you've cited, you know,
[7]numerous, numerous articles in appendix A.
[8]What did you do to -- to figure out who had
[9]paid for those studies to be done?
[10]A. I don't understand the question. What did I
[11]do?
[12]Q. Yeah, let me ask you a different question.
[13]So, there's a number of studies that are
[14]referenced in your supporting documentation to your
[15]report, correct?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. All right, and those studies are performed by
[18]various organizations and scientists around the world,
[19]correct?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. All right. When looking at those studies, did
[22]you do any investigation to see who may have paid for
[23]those studies to have been done?
[24]A. Well, most of the studies that are published
[25]today have a conflict of interest section and they
  Page 67
[1]identify where the authors work, and so, to the extent
[2]that it would be -- research would be needed, it's
[3]usually pretty transparent who they -- who they did the
[4]work for or who they worked for.
[5]But my role as a scientist, in evaluating the
[6]weight of evidence, does not include guessing about
[7]people's potential biases.
[8]It's more focused on what the scientific
[9]methodology would be and identifying any strengths,
[10]weaknesses or inconsistency with other studies for
[11]whatever is the breadth and scope of relevant literature
[12]that I'm -- I'm using to address a particular question.
[13]So, the bottom line is that all research has to
[14]be paid for. It doesn't matter to me if they work for
[15]DePuy or for University of Wisconsin. They all get paid
[16]to do their work. They all want to do more work.
[17]And so, every scientist has their own set of
[18]biases that may relate, in part, to getting, you know,
[19]future work or future research or grants, but it's our
[20]job, as scientists, to put forward a valid set of
[21]information -- that's what peer review is for -- and
[22]basically put out what we believe is a supportable
[23]scientific evidence or opinions.
[24]So, the answer is, I know whether somebody
[25]might have a potential bias by looking at the conflict
  Page 68
[1]of interest section but I don't necessarily give that
[2]any weight to -- to provide credit or discredit at -- on
[3]the evidence.
[4]I look at what the scientific methodology and
[5]overall results mean in the context of all the
[6]scientific literature.
[7]Q. So, let me ask you this.
[8]If -- if you have a study that you know was
[9]paid for to be conducted by a manufacturer of a hip, and
[10]you have a study that was not paid for by the
[11]manufacturer of the hip, and the report that the
[12]manufacturer paid for says the product is safe and the
[13]one that they didn't pay for says it's not safe, that
[14]wouldn't factor into weight that you would give to
[15]either of those studies, is that what you're saying?
[16]MS. CAPODICE: Object to form.
[17]THE WITNESS: Well, in a scientific capacity,
[18]both papers might provide perfectly valid
[19]information so I don't rule out either case, in
[20]terms of contributing to what the scientific
[21]evidence would be.
[22]There may -- let's say that the -- that the
[23]company person who publishes a peer review in a peer
[24]review journal, and in the same peer review journal,
[25]we have a plaintiff expert like Marty Truman or
  Page 69
[1]somebody and -- or -- or Steven Taller, and both
[2]might come up with scientific evidence that's got
[3]some strength to it, and one might have very twisted
[4]opinions in one direction and the other one in the
[5]opposite direction.
[6]I give less weight to the final opinions than I
[7]do to what the methodology and the data presented
[8]are in looking at the competent methodologies and
[9]competent interpretations.
[10]So, again, I'm -- I'm happy to have more
[11]evidence rather than less evidence.
[12]I'd rather have company-funded and
[13]plaintiff-funded or university-funded research to
[14]choose from and evaluate what the answers are to
[15]scientific questions but I don't necessarily adopt
[16]the opinions of any given researcher. I -- I have
[17]my own knowledge base. I have the capability --
[18]especially after a peer review process and being a
[19]peer reviewer for journals, it's their job to say,
[20]is this article transparent and complete and
[21]coherent in terms of the methodology, the results
[22]presented and the interpretations in general. Is it
[23]is it all on the level.
[24]When I go to the scientific literature, I'm
[25]essentially acting like a -- like my own -- in a
  Page 70
[1]peer review capacity, trying to say, what does this
[2]scientific evidence mean?
[3]And many cases, again, the opinions might be
[4]inserted into papers or you might see an editorial
[5]or a review article by the same scientist which
[6]reveals some of the bias one way or the other, but
[7]again, I don't assign credit to anybody based on
[8]their credentials or who they work for or what the
[9]funding source was.
[10]The more -- more good scientific evidence, the
[11]better, and it doesn't matter if there are biases
[12]among the different experts. If they've done a good
[13]job of presenting the scientific evidence, I'll be
[14]able to eventually use that information in
[15]developing my own opinions and object method.
[16]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[17]Q. So, who paid for the study, would, in your
[18]mind, only applied to the ultimate opinion, it wouldn't
[19]apply to the data that's presented, is that fair to say?
[20]A. I'm not sure what you mean by -- did you say,
[21]bad evidence?
[22]I -- I didn't understand that question. I'm
[23]sorry.
[24]Q. Yeah, I'm sorry, and you cut out so I didn't
[25]understand the exchange.
  Page 71
[1]What -- what I'm saying is, in -- your position
[2]is that who paid for the study to be conducted is
[3]important to you only as to their opinions, their
[4]ultimate opinion, not necessarily, the data that's
[5]contained in the study?
[6]A. No, it's the opposite of that.
[7]What -- what matters is the methodology and the
[8]data that's generated, and sometimes there can be a
[9]disconnect between the interpretation or final
[10]statements of opinion that are given in an article and
[11]what the data and/or methodology they provide actually
[12]would support.
[13]So, again, it's not my job, as a scientist, to
[14]guess about people's integrity or their intentions with
[15]respect to getting grant funding or getting litigation,
[16]you know, expert work or whatever.
[17]It's my job to ask the key questions about the
[18]veracity of the scientific evidence that they're
[19]producing and then use that scientific evidence, not
[20]necessarily adopting an individual's opinions or
[21]specific conclusions, but basically coming up with my
[22]own judgment of what that data means.
[23]So, again, that's -- that's the realm.
[24]The realm of litigation supported work or
[25]company-supported work, I don't see that as a negative,
  Page 72
[1]I see that as a positive, because it supports there
[2]being a broader base of scientific information and
[3]evidence to put into the weight of evidence analysis
[4]that I do, and likewise, there are plaintiff experts
[5]that put -- put out the scientific evidence.
[6]And so, I don't rule out think of it, but if
[7]any of it involves poor scientific methodology or
[8]conclusions that are not coherent with respect to the
[9]evidence that they put forward then I'll -- I'll call
[10]them out on it, for sure, if that's going to be part
[11]of -- part of the scientific evidence that I need to --
[12]to comment on.
[13]Q. Doctor, have you ever observed a hip implant
[14]surgery?
[15]A. I have not been to a live implant surgery, no.
[16]Q. Have you ever observed a -- and a similar
[17]question -- a BHR resurfacing surgery?
[18]A. Outside of the actual peer review literature
[19]and books that include vivid photos of the surgeries and
[20]the pathology outcomes in many cases, I have not.
[21]Again, I'm -- you know, I'm not a surgeon. My
[22]goal is really more in the arena of evaluating pathology
[23]relating to the claims of it being a specific metal
[24]adverse effect, whether it's within the hip issue or a
[25]systemic effect in looking at disease causation analysis
  Page 73
[1]as to whether or not the putative cause that's being put
[2]forward is the correct interpretation.
[3]So, I don't do surgeries, I don't examine
[4]implants but I might take data on the pathology from
[5]that surgery or data from an analysis of the amount of
[6]metal lost from the BHR device to do my analysis of the
[7]toxicology issues.
[8]Q. And so, you've never observed a hip explant
[9]surgery either, correct?
[10]A. No, I have not.
[11]Q. Okay. Have you ever discussed any of the
[12]metal-on-metal hip products, including resurfacing, with
[13]any surgeons?
[14]A. I don't recall having any conversation with
[15]surgeons myself.
[16]I recall reading about a lot of different
[17]surgeons kind of opinions, but not personal interaction.
[18]Q. And one of your conclusions you reach in your
[19]report is that the hip implants may not be being put in
[20]correctly and that causing the problem rather than the
[21]ion levels causing the problem.
[22]Is that a fair statement of one of your
[23]opinions?
[24]A. Yeah. Yeah, it's one facet or one aspect of
[25]the reason why implants can fail early.
  Page 74
[1]So, yes, I suppose that's -- that relates, in
[2]particular, to edge loading or loosening of the
[3]components.
[4]Whether it's hip resurfacing or total hip
[5]replacement, you know, that fixation element is a big
[6]part of wear and edge loading will occur after the
[7]implant is put into the body, and that, of course, then,
[8]becomes my -- my, arena, the toxicology of it, what's
[9]the implication of that wear debris in the cobalt and
[10]chromium ion release from that debris.
[11]Q. Have you ever discussed, with any surgeons, the
[12]fact that the hip implants are being put in incorrectly?
[13]A. Again, I have not spoken with surgeons, but
[14]again, the reviews that I've seen by people who have
[15]surveyed surgeons, include commentaries on individual's
[16]specific factors. In other words, whether the patient
[17]is getting -- getting a hip for congenital hip dysplasia
[18]or is a very old person and he has osteoporosis, and has
[19]hip problems associated with poor bone quality.
[20]All those elements are part of the explanation
[21]of what might cause a loosening or a failure that, then,
[22]subsequently can result in higher wear or larger wear
[23]debris generation.
[24]So, in essence, I mention those, not because
[25]that's my expertise, but rather, that's one of the
  Page 75
[1]multiple either individual specific or hydrogenic, you
[2]know, doctor-induced, so to speak, factors that can
[3]impact poor fixation or loosening, as well as then,
[4]subsequently, the wear debris degeneration.
[5]Q. And in your opinion, Doctor, the higher wear
[6]debris, that has the affect of releasing a higher amount
[7]of cobalt and chromium ions, correct?
[8]A. That's -- you know, in a general sense,
[9]that's -- that's correct.
[10]Both the wear volume is the probably the
[11]biggest issue and for metal-on-metal implants, that wear
[12]volume per year is very low compared to what could
[13]happen in terms of wear of earlier generation implants
[14]that were metal-on-metal or certain other implants that
[15]have failed over time.
[16]Q. What is the effect on the body with a higher
[17]wear pattern, and thus, a higher release of cobalt and
[18]chromium ions?
[19]A. Can you be more specific?
[20]I mean, I've given an expert report that's got
[21]all the issues covered.
[22]Are you talking about in hip capsule or
[23]systemically? What --
[24]Q. Let's talk about the -- in the hip capsule.
[25]What effect does a higher amount of cobalt and
  Page 76
[1]chromium ions being released due to a higher wear debris
[2]cause on the -- the hip capsule?
[3]A. Well, it depends on how -- what the rate of
[4]debris generation is and what the size of the particles
[5]would be.
[6]As I've explained in my report, during normal
[7]use patterns, in other words, it's a correctly implanted
[8]BHR, and in a person that doesn't have any unique risk
[9]factors that would cause edge loading or improper
[10]function, so to speak, the wear debris generation rate
[11]is very small, on the order of 1 or 2 cubic millimeters
[12]per year, and that amount of debris is easily handled by
[13]the proteins in the cells, the immune cells that
[14]circulate in the hip capsule.
[15]So, the answer is, there's release and there's
[16]an increase in both cobalt and chromium where particles
[17]in cobalt and chromium metal ion degradation in release,
[18]but that's readily captured -- the ions are ready
[19]captured by the proteins present in the hip capsule and
[20]don't have any negative effect on the hip capsule
[21]issues.
[22]Once you get to an adverse condition where
[23]you're got much higher than normal wear debris
[24]generation, let's say, a hundred cubic millimeters a
[25]year, you overwhelm those systems and can get both a
  Page 77
[1]foreign body reaction, macrophages orientation or it's
[2]like an oriented increase in pure purulent fluids
[3]getting into the hip capsule and/or other immune --
[4]immune reactions when you get evaluated amounts of
[5]cobalt and chromium either in the blood or the hip
[6]tissues.
[7]But again, the outcome, as far as cobalt and
[8]chromium ions, is many times individual-specific and it
[9]takes quite a large dose released over a fairly short
[10]time period -- that's what I mean by dose rate -- it
[11]takes a very high dose rate to overwhelm the normal
[12]defense mechanism and cause a result in synovial tissue
[13]damage or other hip capsule tissue damage.
[14]Q. Okay. So, if the metal-on-metal hip implant
[15]discharges ions in a -- in a properly placed device, the
[16]amount of cobalt and chromium that's discharged isn't
[17]very much in the scientific toxicology analysis, Is that
[18]your position?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. All right, and then those ions that are
[21]discharged is flushed out by the system, the body's own
[22]system and natural processes of the body, is that your
[23]position?
[24]A. Well, I mean, as I mentioned in my report, it's
[25]not quite that simple.
  Page 78
[1]It goes with the physical, chemical properties
[2]of each metal and even with some unknown factors in
[3]terms of what the rate of corrosion of the particles to
[4]ions would be.
[5]So, in the case of chromium, most of the
[6]chromium from the -- from the wear debris, based on the
[7]scientific evidence of looking at explants, most of the
[8]chromium stays in the hip tissue whereas the vast
[9]majority or all of the cobalt in normal situations
[10]actually gets flushed out into -- into the bloodstream
[11]and then cleared from the body.
[12]So you see residual chromium in the -- in the
[13]hip capsule, that doesn't have any consequence, but it's
[14]there, and all of the metal ions, as they -- they are
[15]released, end up getting attached to proteins and any
[16]larger particles, for the most part, end up getting
[17]consumed, you know, if they get surprised by immune
[18]cells, like macrophages and histiocytes.
[19]So, there's a complex kind of cleaning system
[20]going on, part of which is vacuuming up by macrophages
[21]and histiocytes, part of which is washing of the debris
[22]where cobalt gets washed out, and then the third part is
[23]insoluble ions like -- not -- not ions, but protein
[24]complexes or oxides of chromium that end up just
[25]staining or being left in the cracks of the -- the hip
  Page 79
[1]capsules, so to speak, the crevices of that, and don't
[2]have any real outcome.
[3]So, then -- you know, it's a complex process
[4]and the body is reacting to the presence of foreign
[5]particles or foreign debris in the body and is part of
[6]the natural -- natural expectation of implanting a
[7]foreign, you know, metal device in the body that the
[8]body is going to have certain -- certain reactions and
[9]trying to get rid of that foreign body by its nature.
[10]MR. MATHEWS: Okay.
[11]MS. CAPODICE: Todd, are we -- we've been going
[12]over an hour.
[13]MR. MATHEWS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is
[14]actually a good time. Let's take a break.
[15]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record 11:24.
[16](Recess taken)
[17](After recess)
[18]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video record
[19]11:37.
[20]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[21]Q. All right, Doctor, I just kind of want to close
[22]out this area that we've been talking about.
[23]You would agree that in a metal-on-metal device
[24]there are cobalt and chromium ions discharged due to the
[25]friction created between the two surfaces right?
  Page 80
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[2]THE WITNESS: Yes. There would be wear debris.
[3]It's not so much cobalt ions being released
[4]immediately, it's more wear debris occurring, and
[5]then breaking down into the cobalt, mainly cobalt
[6]ions, but cobalt and chromium ions.
[7]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[8]Q. And then, your opinion is, then, the cobalt
[9]gets flushed out, the chromium stays, joins up with
[10]proteins, but the chromium, in that form, is not bad for
[11]the health of the patient.
[12]Is that a fair overview?
[13]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[14]THE WITNESS: It's -- it's probably
[15]oversimplifying.
[16]Some chromium does get flushed out with the
[17]cobalt, but on balance, over the long, long
[18]situation, in situ, you get accumulation of you
[19]know, minor amounts of chromium, chromium oxides and
[20]the phosphates that occur in sand. You have a
[21]superior hip capsule, whereas, essentially, all of
[22]the cobalt compounds that are released from the
[23]fine -- the nano particle debris get flushed out
[24]into the systemic circulation if they're not
[25]engulfed by immune cells.
  Page 81
[1]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[2]Q. And, so then, if the device, in your opinion,
[3]isn't put in correctly, then there's a greater potential
[4]for elevated cobalt and chromium ions to be discharged,
[5]correct?
[6]A. As we discussed, that's one -- one facet or
[7]possibility contributing to increased micro motion and
[8]loosening of the components of the -- of the hip implant
[9]and that relates then to increased wear debris which
[10]then begets these different reactions.
[11]It wants the body's defensive reactions to try
[12]to isolate and/or remove the foreign particles.
[13]Q. Do you know, from a surgical standpoint, is it
[14]more -- is it easier to implant a total hip or is it
[15]easier to implant a resurfacing product?
[16]A. I -- I don't have the expertise to really give
[17]you an opinion on that.
[18]I can -- you know, my general impression is
[19]that the -- the surgical -- the surgical component in
[20]both cases is very complex and requires a lot of
[21]expertise, and so, I don't -- again, I don't have -- I
[22]don't have -- it's not -- it's not my expertise to
[23]comment on that particularly.
[24]Q. Do you know who Dr. McMinn is?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 82
[1]Q. And Dr. McMinn is the creator of the BHR
[2]resurfacing product, is that your understanding?
[3]A. He was the designer, as I understand it, yes.
[4]Q. Would it surprise you to know that he has said
[5]it take -- it would take a surgeon about a thousand
[6]operations to become competent at implanting a BHR
[7]resurfacing device?
[8]MS. CAPODICE: Object to form and scope.
[9]But you can answer.
[10]THE WITNESS: I -- I don't know -- I don't
[11]know, you know, what his personality or level of
[12]perfection is, but I'm sure it impacts -- impacts
[13]how he -- how he describes that. I just don't know.
[14]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[15]Q. Do you think it would be something important
[16]for the manufacturers of this resurfacing product to
[17]warn surgeons that there's a likelihood that cobalt and
[18]chromium ion discharge would increase with the hip not
[19]being absolutely in the proper position during the
[20]surgery?
[21]MS. CAPODICE: Object to form, and also outside
[22]the scope of Dr. Kerger's expert report.
[23]You're welcome to answer, if you can.
[24]THE WITNESS: Yeah, and again, warnings are not
[25]what I was asked to look at here, but in the same
  Page 83
[1]mind set, when you're implanting a foreign device in
[2]the body, inherently, the body is going to have a
[3]reaction to -- to it and its wear debris, regardless
[4]of whether it's made of cobalt chromium or
[5]polyethylene or ceramic.
[6]Any -- any device of this nature is going to
[7]have wear debris and that's something that surgeons
[8]most likely recognize, and whether it's cobalt and
[9]chromium only really has -- has import when you've
[10]got very severe failure situations.
[11]That would be my comment on it.
[12]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[13]Q. And do you think that a company acting in a
[14]safe manner would warn surgeons of this increased risk
[15]of ion discharge if the device isn't implanted properly?
[16]MS. CAPODICE: Object to form.
[17]THE WITNESS: Again, that's not the scope of
[18]my -- my work in this case, but from a toxicology
[19]perspective, it's based on, you know, the -- the
[20]frequency of -- of such failures or dramatic
[21]failures that would involve the need to provide that
[22]as a common problem.
[23]You know, it's all -- it's all kind of
[24]dependent on what the data show, and so, evaluation
[25]of what's a responsible act has to take into account
  Page 84
[1]what the toxicology information may have said at the
[2]time about what does or doesn't happen with respect
[3]to the wear, and I think over time, you know,
[4]updating -- updating the label information, so to
[5]speak for new people who get these implants put in,
[6]that's the responsibility of FDA or the other
[7]European agency that oversee the safety of implants.
[8]So, it -- these companies are regulated by the
[9]U.S., FDA, and are expected to follow their
[10]guidelines and it's less about what the company
[11]believes.
[12]It's more about how the regulations impact
[13]proper warnings, how the regulations impact
[14]expectations as to how products stewardship and
[15]additional postmarked data collection occurs, and
[16]then reasonable interpretations from within that
[17]context is what I would expect a responsible actions
[18]of a company to be judged by.
[19]So, I don't have any specifics, but that's,
[20]again, what I -- what I would presume.
[21]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[22]Q. Other than the device being implanted
[23]incorrectly, what are, in your opinion, the other
[24]reasons for these failed hip implant devices, if not for
[25]the chromium and cobalt ion discharge?
  Page 85
[1]A. Are you talking about BHRs, particularly?
[2]Q. Yes, yes.
[3]A. So, there's -- as I comment in my report and
[4]reviewed in the literature for quite a while, a number
[5]of different factors that are not really implant-related
[6]in particular but are patient-related have been
[7]identified and they have to do with, again, the risk of
[8]loosening above and beyond what would be the surgical
[9]placement elements, and so, we've already talked about
[10]poor bone quality as a result of osteoporosis or prior
[11]injury or dysplasia, you know, malformations that can
[12]occur just from congenital or injury-related outcomes
[13]over the hip patient's history.
[14]All those can certainly complicate the -- or
[15]add to the risk of loosening of either the -- the head
[16]that's placed on top of the femur or the acetabular cup.
[17]And then, in addition to that, there's risk
[18]factors that have to do with the body size of the
[19]individual, the strength of the musculature around the
[20]hip implant and their particular healing that occurs
[21]after the surgeon cuts them open, and you know, and
[22]drills holes in their bone and puts foreign -- foreign,
[23]you know, foreign parts of any nature, into the hip
[24]capsule and then how that -- how that actually heals, is
[25]all kind of individual-specific because, obviously, a
  Page 86
[1]surgeon contribution to that.
[2]But that's why this is so complicated is that
[3]there are many different elements that can create a risk
[4]of a lesion occurring independent of -- of what the
[5]implant might have done or that increases, for example,
[6]dislocations.
[7]We know, for example, that the smaller head
[8]sizes that were prevalent among females that are
[9]typically smaller in size, that that dislocation was a
[10]big problem with smaller head sizes, so, in particular
[11]with the BHR, and so, they stopped implanting those
[12]after gathering data that showed that there was
[13]increased dislocation. Dislocation leads to mall
[14]placement or loosening of both the cup and the head.
[15]And so, lessons learned over time about which
[16]risk factors, which individual's specific risk factors
[17]might enhance the failure of the device as part of what
[18]I expect any -- any company to do in terms of -- you
[19]know, post -- post-market monitoring and research and
[20]making sure that, you know, people know what the risks
[21]are and surgeons know, you know, what -- what risk
[22]factors may need to be advised or might need to be
[23]considered exclusionary for using this -- this
[24]particular device.
[25]Q. And so, I just want to make sure I understand
  Page 87
[1]one particular thing.
[2]You are aware that Smith & Nephew indicated
[3]that the resurfacing product should not be used for
[4]women or smaller head size males, and it's your opinion
[5]that that's because of a dislocation issue rather than a
[6]cobalt or chromium related issue?
[7]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[8]THE WITNESS: Well, again, one begets the
[9]other, in some -- some ways, basically, that a
[10]tendency towards dislocation increases the risk of
[11]more substantial wear generation of large -- larger
[12]size debris related to edge loading, and that's an
[13]unusual or poor performance characteristic of the
[14]BHR in those individuals. So, they're related,
[15]certainly.
[16]It's not just a dislocation that -- that is the
[17]problem, but in each case it's individual-specific.
[18]Sometimes it's just the physical trauma, as I
[19]understand, from the dislocation events that leads
[20]to, you know, the pain and the need for a revision,
[21]and in some cases it could be, again, larger --
[22]larger edge loading, micron size particles, that
[23]might contribute to an immune response, a foreign
[24]particle response that increases the risk of pain or
[25]failure related to the foreign body response. So,
  Page 88
[1]each individual is going to be different.
[2]Again, getting to a kind of a characteristic
[3]like dislocation risk that can be warned about and
[4]people can understand, is -- is an important element
[5]of again, that postmarket monitoring and research
[6]and making sure that you don't have a large number
[7]of people who might be at greater risk of either
[8]loss of fixation or to dislocation-related injury
[9]from implant.
[10]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[11]Q. So, where you and I disagree is more of a
[12]chicken and the egg situation where your position is
[13]that dislocation occurred and that has the ability to
[14]release greater than expected cobalt chromium ions,
[15]whereas I have the position that the cobalt and chromium
[16]ions are what have caused the problem, regardless of the
[17]dislocation.
[18]Does that seem to be a fair generalization of
[19]it?
[20]MS. CAPODICE: Objection. Form.
[21]THE WITNESS: No, it's -- it's not a chicken
[22]and egg situation.
[23]It's not that -- in other words, you can't --
[24]you don't get dislocation as a result of cobalt and
[25]chromium ion release.
  Page 89
[1]Dislocation occurs because of the physical
[2]nexus and the entire hip structure including
[3]musculature, the bone, the tendons, basically not
[4]being tight enough to keep the -- the proper bearing
[5]surface relationships.
[6]That has nothing to do with -- in other words,
[7]you can't induce that induce that by releasing
[8]cobalt and chromium. That's, in essence, a physical
[9]characteristic of the outcome of the surgery that
[10]leads to the dislocation risk.
[11]There's always -- you know, there's
[12]permutations that always occur again about what
[13]might cause loosening of for example, the acetabular
[14]cups or the -- you know, the -- the -- the head of
[15]the BHR.
[16]But in essence, most of the time dislocation is
[17]related to something that's beyond -- it's more of a
[18]physical situation is my understanding.
[19]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[20]Q. Is it your opinion that damage from chromium
[21]and cobalt in the hip cannot cause dislocation?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[23]THE WITNESS: So, I -- I guess, among the
[24]permutations would be if you had a very large amount
[25]of edge loading occurring where it didn't quite
  Page 90
[1]dislocate, and then an immune response came in to
[2]deal with those large particles, but also, enhance
[3]the -- the -- the fixation problem or worsened the
[4]fixation problem as a result of the immune response.
[5]You can see there being a contribution of that
[6]debris to ultimate dislocation-related failure.
[7]But again, I think, as I understand, the way
[8]I've read it, the vast majority of dislocation cases
[9]are related more to the physical -- physical
[10]situation of the entire -- how the entire hip and
[11]all of the biological attachments fit properly
[12]together.
[13]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[14]Q. It seems like your opinions really trigger off
[15]of one important factor.
[16]In the asbestos world, I would call it dose
[17]response. In this world, it seems to focus on your
[18]findings of relatively small particle numbers and the
[19]sizes of wear debris, and based on your opinion, there
[20]isn't enough of the cobalt and chromium particles to
[21]cause the injuries that are alleged.
[22]Is that fair?
[23]A. That's one piece of it, and then, again, the
[24]bigger picture here is that it's not just about how many
[25]particles are released or what the composition, metal
  Page 91
[1]composition, so to speak, of those metal particles would
[2]be.
[3]It's the size, range which, again, impacts
[4]whether you can trigger a biological response, a foreign
[5]body response for those micron size particles.
[6]And then for smaller particles, the nano
[7]particles that do degrade into cobalt and chromium ions
[8]more readily, the homeostasis that occurs inside the hip
[9]capsule is managed by the fluid that the body provides
[10]into -- into that space.
[11]The proteins basically serve as the carriers
[12]for taking away the cobalt and the chromium and flushing
[13]it out into the blood, but there there's also immune
[14]cells that naturally monitor and do engulf any foreign
[15]particles that are large enough to be recognized.
[16]So you've got -- you've got a complex situation
[17]that all depends on dose rates, meaning, how much of the
[18]cobalt and chromium ions is available in a -- in a free
[19]ionic form from the natural wear and/or corrosion of
[20]those wear particles in the hip capsule.
[21]And what I've explained in my report is that
[22]there's a high threshold that in terms of exhibiting any
[23]toxicity to those local hip tissues, that depends on the
[24]presence and the continuing and ongoing resupply of
[25]protein fluids that bathe the hip capsule, and while it
  Page 92
[1]bathes the hip capsule and lubricates, in essence, that
[2]bearing surface, it, also, serves to bind up the free
[3]cobalt and free chromium, and with relatively high
[4]capacity, prevent there being any significant tissue
[5]toxicity there.
[6]And likewise, the stuff that's flushed out into
[7]the bloodstream, you have to get to very high levels on
[8]the order of 300 micrograms per liter or higher, as I've
[9]explained in my report, even again to see any systemic
[10]effects and most of those systemic effects are readily
[11]reversible once the cobalt levels are -- are quelled.
[12]In other words, once there's a revision surgery
[13]or once there is a resolution of whatever is causing the
[14]increased wear, most of the outcomes are not from the
[15]individual as far as systemic -- systemic effects.
[16]Q. Would one of those systemic effects be a
[17]pseudotumor developing?
[18]A. No. Pseudotumor is a local hip capsule
[19]outcome.
[20]Q. And you're aware that pseudotumors are common
[21]in well positioned low-wearing metal-on-metal hips?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[23]THE WITNESS: Pseudotumors are common in hip
[24]implants, period. That's my understanding.
[25]And you know, what we're talking about here,
  Page 93
[1]is, again, a part of the body's natural response to
[2]foreign -- larger foreign particle, is that if there
[3]are too many or too large of foreign particles in
[4]the hip capsule that are detected by -- by the
[5]immune cells that monitor the situation, it calls
[6]for -- you know, the body calls for more activity
[7]including macrophages, but also, fiberglass that
[8]will come into the hip capsule and try to wall off
[9]any -- any antigenicity or foreign particle presence
[10]that the macrophages are incapable of -- of
[11]ingesting and removing.
[12]So, formation of cysts and/or scar tissue
[13]inside the hip capsule is a natural outcome of
[14]having an implant in there.
[15]And you're right that in most cases it's
[16]asymptomatic and/or it's minor with respect to the
[17]decree agree of scarring where it doesn't cause any
[18]fluid accumulation, or you know, swelling or other
[19]outcomes that can cause an immediate problem.
[20]But in is some cases it does. You know, if the
[21]pseudotumors or the cyst occurs in an area adjacent
[22]to a nerve and fluid builds up it can pinch a nerve
[23]and cause an outcome quite immediately that's a
[24]problem, and in other cases, it forms in places that
[25]don't impact either blood supply, lymph -- lymph
  Page 94
[1]drainage or the nerves, and it has no outcome.
[2]But the key issue here is that it's -- that
[3]outcome is dependent, predominantly, on particle
[4]size and it's accumulation of larger debris rather
[5]than what the metal-on-metal implant under normal
[6]circumstances generates which is fine nano
[7]particles, and we don't get that as a common or a
[8]natural outcome of fine wear debris.
[9]In other words, cobalt ions don't cause
[10]pseudotumors, per se. It's cobalt chromium alloyed
[11]particles that are large enough to -- for the body
[12]to recognize and for this extended immune reaction,
[13]including scar tissue formation, to be triggered.
[14]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[15]Q. The foreign particles that could be present in
[16]a -- could be present and cause a pseudotumor would be
[17]the hip implant, correct?
[18]The foreign particles would come from the hip
[19]implant, correct?
[20]A. Right. In -- in those situations, again, where
[21]generally it's hip -- it's edge loading or corrosion,
[22]and again, depending on which implant you're talking
[23]about.
[24]You can get head, neck, corrosion that would be
[25]releasing larger corrosion, you know, threading
  Page 95
[1]corrosion debris and/or edge loading of the bearing
[2]surface that can lead to these larger alloy particles
[3]being released that are in the micron size range and
[4]that the body -- if there is enough of that type of
[5]particle accumulation in the hip implant the body will
[6]ultimately recognize that it can't deal with it using
[7]macrophages, and so, it will call for a more rigorous
[8]walling off of those particles.
[9]And then, again, this happens with all
[10]implants, whether it's metal-on-metal or metal-on-poly,
[11]or ceramic-on-ceramic.
[12]All particles that are in the micron size range
[13]regardless whether they're metal, ceramic, plastic, all
[14]such particles will be recognized as foreign debris that
[15]the body needs to deal with and eliminate or wall off,
[16]and that the nature of -- of pseudotumors.
[17]Q. But pseudotumors can be created by the presence
[18]of chromium cobalt allow of particles, correct?
[19]A. Large -- large particles in the micron size
[20]range or -- larger, yes.
[21]Q. In preparing your report, did you review all of
[22]the recalls that have occurred related to metal-on-metal
[23]hip products since 2008?
[24]A. No. That was -- I'm aware of the different
[25]recalls, in general, but analysis of that is not really
  Page 96
[1]part of what I did for this report.
[2]Q. You're aware that in 2008, the Zimmer Durom
[3]acetabular cup was recalled, aren't you?
[4]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and scope.
[5]THE WITNESS: I -- I don't recall the specifics
[6]of that. That's not something I looked at in my
[7]report here.
[8]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[9]Q. Do you recall authoring a -- a paper called
[10]"Halo and Spillover Effect Illustrations for Selected
[11]Beneficial Medical Devices and Drugs"?
[12]Do you remember that?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. And in that -- let me -- let me attempt to
[15]share my screen again here.
[16]In that report -- let me make it bigger for
[17]you. Hang on.
[18]In that report you take a look at the effects
[19]of this halo and spillover effect as it relates to
[20]metal-on-metal hip products, correct?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. Right, as well as some other items, such as
[23]breast implants and cassowary, a drug.
[24]And your basic premise of this article is that
[25]once people start having problems with a product that
  Page 97
[1]oftentimes doctors will just go ahead and explant
[2]products because there's a growing swell of thought
[3]amongst the patients that they need to have this product
[4]out because other people are having problems with it.
[5]Is that a generalization of the position in
[6]this paper?
[7]A. That's -- that's one of the components, yes.
[8]Q. And the premise that you're trying to put forth
[9]is that it doesn't have to do with a product being
[10]defective but has more to do with the perception from
[11]the medical community and the patients as a whole.
[12]Is that fair?
[13]A. Well, yeah.
[14]That's -- that's again in the behavioral human
[15]factors arena.
[16]One of the -- one of my colleagues that was a
[17]co-author on this paper was in the human factors
[18]expertise arena.
[19]So, those are -- those are human factors
[20]elements of what we call the spillover effect, and
[21]it's -- in more of a scientific perspective, it would be
[22]the influence of interpretation of evidence in the
[23]context of litigation, scientific evidence, on one
[24]particular product, let's say, you know, the ASR and
[25]what its history or claims about its history,
  Page 98
[1]scientifically, would be in the scientific literature,
[2]and that that would -- that can spill over the -- what
[3]are the negative consequences of one particular device
[4]among, you know, a group of let's say, six or seven
[5]different manufacturers, and you know, a dozen or two
[6]different individual products.
[7]Once the ASR became recognized as problematic
[8]then it spilled over, cast doubts, scientifically, about
[9]the reliability of -- of every metal-on-metal hip
[10]implant.
[11]So, again, there's a scientific -- there's the
[12]scientific evidence component, and that can be
[13]influenced by publication bias, in other words, by peer
[14]review journals only considering positive results,
[15]meaning, like, negative -- negative outcome results that
[16]were significant as being more of a public or scientific
[17]interest. You can get some bias in that respect.
[18]But in the big picture, again, it's about what
[19]the specific configuration -- let's say, distinguishing
[20]the BHR from the ASR. You've got many specific
[21]scientific differences in terms of the risk of there
[22]being any -- any kind of failure related to taper
[23]corrosion or head-neck connection, modular connections
[24]that doesn't occur with the BHR.
[25]You've got a very different population of
  Page 99
[1]patients for the BHR, which usually, are younger
[2]individuals who hope to retain more of their bone, and
[3]so physicians rightly judge that as a consideration to
[4]try to retain bone -- bone mass and retain the potential
[5]to go to THR rather than go straight to boring -- you
[6]know, cutting off your femur and boring a hole down
[7]your -- your bone to put a stem in there.
[8]So, there's a lot of different technical and
[9]scientific considerations that would make it not
[10]appropriate, scientifically, to extend the information,
[11]for example, that's been developed on the ASR and its
[12]performance, and overlay it as being an outcome of
[13]concern on the BHR.
[14]So, that just to be clear, again, there are
[15]human factors elements which have to do with what people
[16]think about managing patient's happiness, you know, what
[17]physicians think about managing patient's happiness or
[18]avoiding lawsuits and/or what patients might think about
[19]oh, this thing is toxic, I want this taken out of me,
[20]just based on what they've heard on news reports not by
[21]evaluating scientific evidence or relying on a
[22]particular expert's opinion. So, that's what this paper
[23]is about.
[24]That happened with breast implants, that
[25]happened with certain IUDs, mainly, in the United States
  Page 100
[1]because there is such a litigation-related influence on
[2]human factors elements in this context.
[3]That also happen with the cassowary drug, as
[4]well.
[5]So, that what I'm pointing out, that it's not
[6]just one thing. It's not just people's opinions about
[7]the scientific evidence that leads to kind of guilty
[8]before being proven aspects of -- of a medical device or
[9]a drug. It's -- you know, it's human factors and
[10]generalizations in many cases, be it unfair or
[11]inappropriate of the scientific evidence, if you will.
[12]MR. MATHEWS: Okay, so, I just want to briefly
[13]go on page 5 of this report that we've talked about
[14]and I'll use this report as Exhibit 5.
[15](Plaintiff's Exhibit 5, marked for
[16]identification)
[17]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[18]Q. And page 5 of that has a chart here, table 3,
[19]and it specifically references the Zimmer Durom AS
[20]metal-on-metal being withdrawn from the U.S. market.
[21]And so, that happens, and then there's a host
[22]of recalls that occur after that.
[23]The DePuy ASR is recalled in 2010,
[24]Smith & Nephew and their R3 liner, they recalled that.
[25]Then Zimmer pulls off the ML taper hip. Profemur pulls
  Page 101
[1]off their cobalt chromium metal-on-metal product.
[2]Wright Medical off their long chromium 8 product.
[3]Stryker pulls off ABG2 and Rejuvenate. They also pull
[4]off their list, V40. And BHR tells doctors not to use
[5]the resurfacing product on women and small head size men
[6]in 2016.
[7]And so, the premise of your paper would suggest
[8]that these products were recalled due to litigation
[9]purposes, doctors not wanting to implant products that
[10]had had a problem and potentially them face litigation
[11]issues or the public's perception that these products
[12]weren't safe, rather than the scientific studies that
[13]were done that led to the removal of these products from
[14]the market.
[15]Is that your position?
[16]MS. CAPODICE: Objection. Form.
[17]THE WITNESS: I guess my -- my position -- and
[18]I'll let the paper speak for itself -- but I can
[19]reiterate that the scientific evidence, whether it's
[20]hip implants or breast implants or you know the IUD
[21]issues that come up, the scientific evidence often
[22]has a very small part of the overall mechanism or
[23]wheels that turn that relate to product recalls
[24]and/or to non-use of a drug or device especially in
[25]the United States, and that, again, centers around
  Page 102
[1]negative opinions and/or specific litigation
[2]outcomes and what begets that right is we've got
[3]higher risk of litigation against a manufacturer,
[4]and if you're a physician who implants only that
[5]manufacturer device, then it -- they can consider if
[6]it's time to rethink whether they want to do that
[7]going forward so that they don't take on risk of
[8]litigation.
[9]So, again, it's not technical. It's not the
[10]strength of scientific evidence necessarily that
[11]drives these recalls, it's a level of subjective
[12]risk management from the litigation perspective, but
[13]also, appropriate elements of product stewardship
[14]that as they learn from their specific device
[15]whether or not what might have been found for say,
[16]the ASR is true for let's say, the BHR, responsible
[17]conduct, and/or you know, the need to pull those
[18]products as you say.
[19]If it's not something that's a directive from
[20]FDA, it's a subjective decision on the part of the
[21]company in terms of managing risk and it can occur
[22]in the absence of good scientific evidence that --
[23]that there was a problem with the implant.
[24]And so, that's -- that's really what the paper
[25]is about, is that the scientific evidence is often a
  Page 103
[1]small nugget of product-specific -- you know,
[2]meaning, down to the actual individual product.
[3]And the frequency or occurrence of that
[4]particular problem might not even be statistically
[5]significant in some ways, but then, it has a kind of
[6]an avalanche effect on the whole -- the whole
[7]category of devices in this case with the
[8]metal-on-metal hip implants.
[9]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[10]Q. Okay. Well, now flipping over to page 17 of
[11]this article, and about halfway down the first column
[12]there's a statement here made that says:
[13]Litigation and regulatory decisions in the U.S.
[14]have clearly played substantial roles in generating
[15]stigma that ultimately affects use patterns of
[16]entire categories of beneficial drugs and medical
[17]devices with potential lasting impacts on public
[18]health and policy.
[19]Is that something that you wrote for this
[20]article?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. All right, and that really summarizes your
[23]opinion fairly well, that litigation and regulatory
[24]decisions are driving products and devices rather than
[25]science, is that correct?
  Page 104
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[2]THE WITNESS: That -- that can be -- that can
[3]occur. Yeah, that's part of what we're
[4]illustrating.
[5]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[6]Q. And let me see here.
[7]In representing corporations, which is what
[8]Exponent's vast majority of their work has done, part of
[9]that is you give presentations in COE format sometimes,
[10]correct?
[11]A. Sometimes, yes.
[12]Q. All right, and I'll mark as Exhibit 6 -- this
[13]is a paper that was done by you and a few others for the
[14]IADC mid-year conference in 2019, correct?
[15]A. Yes, I believe so.
[16]Q. All right, and this COE was focused on IARC,
[17]which is THE International Agency for Research On
[18]Cancer, correct?
[19]A. Yes. It was on evaluation of scientific
[20]evidence for classification of carcinogenicity in
[21]particular, so that's not really relevant to this
[22]relevant to this case, but I was -- I was the
[23]technical -- the scientific contributor so to speak or
[24]speaker with respect to the issues of how they
[25]determine -- how IARC determines cause and effect, so to
  Page 105
[1]speak.
[2]Q. Okay, and IARC is the research arm as it
[3]relates to cancer for the World Health Organization,
[4]correct?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. Okay, and in this -- I'll -- I'll call it a
[7]paper. I presume it's a summary that was presented in
[8]some sort of oral form, in person, back in 2019, and it
[9]really goes to specific cases that IARC studies were
[10]used, that the paper is critical of the studies having
[11]been used to support the plaintiff's position, is that
[12]fair?
[13]A. That was kind of a confusing question. I'm not
[14]sure what you -- can you be more specific?
[15]Q. Sure.
[16]This presentation focused on cases where IARC
[17]studies or the position of IARC had been used to support
[18]the plaintiff's position that certain products caused
[19]cancer, and this paper is critical of the IARC standards
[20]being used, correct?
[21]A. So, there's -- there's a lot of context missing
[22]from -- from me being able to say something meaningful
[23]in answer to that question, and the issue centers on
[24]IARC is not like -- is not a true research entity, like,
[25]for example, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
  Page 106
[1]Registry or NIOSH in the United States.
[2]It's not a group of government employees that
[3]summarize and put together documents for public health
[4]information.
[5]IARC is -- is a -- it's an entity that calls
[6]together groups of people from around the world to
[7]participate in workshops and create summary documents.
[8]So, those people don't work for IARC, they work
[9]for whatever, you know, academic institution, government
[10]institution or industry that might have expertise in
[11]that particular topic, right?
[12]So, their job at IARC is to be kind of a
[13]recruiter, a selector of experts, and then, the
[14]workshops basically have those experts put together a
[15]scientific document, which is called a monograph, that
[16]evaluates what we call hazard identification aspects
[17]of -- of -- of a particular chemical.
[18]And the bigger confusion points, which I point
[19]out in this discussion, is that it's called the
[20]International Agency for Research On Cancer but they
[21]don't actually do research on cancer, and the documents
[22]that they put out -- the documents that they put out are
[23]actually put forward as hazard identification rather
[24]than risk assessment.
[25]So, they're not actually allowed to look at
  Page 107
[1]data on whether the hazard they identified is a real
[2]risk. They just have to put tunnel vision glasses on
[3]with respect to risk assessment information.
[4]So, that's the biggest part of the import of
[5]this, is that in some cases -- and this has been, you
[6]know, talked about in some scientific literature as
[7]well -- in some cases, the IARC panel that's selected is
[8]more heavily influenced by, let's say, a regulatory
[9]position in the United States, and that relationship,
[10]say, in the United States -- you couldn't get a
[11]regulatory decision, let's say, through EPA methods and
[12]peer review. You couldn't get a positive decision
[13]there, but rather, if you take that same expert and put
[14]them on an IARC panel or workshop, they can influence
[15]the other researchers that's come to the opposite
[16]conclusion, in other words, come to a positive evidence
[17]conclusion about whether or not this chemical, mixing up
[18]all in this case, would be glyphosate, whether the
[19]glyphosate -- the evidence for glyphosate is sufficient
[20]to call it or classify it as a carcinogen.
[21]Those -- those are -- again, that's the nexus
[22]between evaluation of carcinogenicity evidence in both
[23]animals and humans and regulatory classification
[24]decisions.
[25]That happens differently in the United States
  Page 108
[1]under our rules and our peer review requirements than it
[2]does at -- under IARC, which is an independent agency,
[3]again, that can be influenced by individuals quite
[4]substantially.
[5]So, there are certain IARC decisions that, in
[6]the United States, EPA did not classify, similarly, the
[7]evidence of -- for there being a -- a classification
[8]status that's supported by weight of evidence and that's
[9]what this is about.
[10]This is about the rules of selecting the -- the
[11]appropriate experts and how, in some cases, the export,
[12]so to speak, of people, scientists or regulatory --
[13]regulatory scientists who have a particular opinion
[14]about scientific evidence, they can influence the
[15]outcome and come to a different outcome in the IARC
[16]workshop setting, and that creates confusion across the
[17]world, in essence, because then, the IARC decision or
[18]classification, let's say, on PCBs, they say, okay, we
[19]think now the classification of the evidence should go
[20]higher and we believe it's a known human carcinogen.
[21]Then, in California, for example, they will
[22]adopt anything that IARC says is a final appropriate
[23]classification or conclusion under Prop 65, and they'll
[24]say, okay, now PCBs are a known human carcinogen because
[25]IARC says so, and then that influences litigation in the
  Page 109
[1]United States.
[2]So, that's why, you know, in the -- in this
[3]IADC presentation, the scientific information was
[4]important or relevant is because, basically, there was
[5]influence of U.S. scientists on a European entity's
[6]outcomes or decisions that then got exported back to the
[7]United States and influenced litigation in California
[8]and glyphosate was kind of an example, in 2019, of -- of
[9]how that can happen.
[10](Plaintiff's Exhibit 6, marked for
[11]identification)
[12]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[13]Q. Okay, so, I want to go back to -- all right, so
[14]we see here what we've been talking about, which is
[15]glyphosate, which is a Monsanto product by the trade
[16]name of Roundup, that's been banned in 17 countries and
[17]24 states -- it put some sort of limit on it -- but it's
[18]your position that the IARC designation of it being a
[19]possible carcinogen should be ignored by the court
[20]because it doesn't meet a certain standard, in your
[21]mind?
[22]Is that -- am I picking it that up right?
[23]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[24]THE WITNESS: You know, we're getting pretty
[25]far afield from what -- what I think I'm supposed to
  Page 110
[1]be talking about in this case.
[2]But in that -- but in that instance, again, I'm
[3]telling a community of lawyers, who are more
[4]science -- you know, environmental and toxic tort
[5]lawyers what the import of this process, this
[6]peer -- essentially peer contribution, peer
[7]selection of experts has or had on evaluating the
[8]scientific evidence.
[9]The evidence is what it is for glyphosate. Up
[10]until this point in 2019, the evidence had not
[11]really changed substantially, but in the United
[12]States the same considerations were evaluated and
[13]they did not come to a positive conclusion.
[14]So, my point is that interpretations of IARC
[15]had been influenced by kind of a -- you know, what
[16]the -- what the workshop contributors' contributions
[17]were, and there were stronger personalities that
[18]ended up influencing the positive classification for
[19]gluphosate, whereas in the United States, they --
[20]that was not considered a valid and scientific
[21]conclusion.
[22]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[23]Q. Okay.
[24]A. So, the difference is that different --
[25]different groups of individuals considered that can be
  Page 111
[1]purported to be experts in a particular chemical or a
[2]particular arena, can come to different conclusions on
[3]the same scientific evidence.
[4]But in this case, we've got a situation where
[5]it's a regulatory entity in the United -- in the -- in
[6]the -- in Europe that influencing, ultimately, what was
[7]a negative or opposite conclusion reached in the United
[8]States through this IARC process.
[9]Q. All right. So, you told me early on, at the
[10]beginning, that Exponent provides litigation services,
[11]expert witness services for manufacturers who are being
[12]sued in asbestos litigation.
[13]On page 3 of this document there is reference
[14]to an asbestos case, and people have known -- its been
[15]well known in the scientific industry that asbestos
[16]causes asbestosis, mesothelioma, all types of nasty
[17]health issues.
[18]Are you telling me that IARC has somehow come
[19]to a different conclusion than U.S. regulatory
[20]committees on asbestos, as well?
[21]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[22]THE WITNESS: You know, you saw that I'm not
[23]the only author on this. This was more legal --
[24]legal interpretations. That's not -- not my
[25]contribution.
  Page 112
[1]I have to say again, IARC has -- has commanded
[2]a different set of opinions compared to what less
[3]scientists evaluating using the same information
[4]have -- have arrived at with respect to the
[5]regulatory classifications, and in this case, the
[6]evaluation of chrysotile, which is the least
[7]hazardous -- the least -- lease hazardous of
[8]asbestos based on epidemiologic and animal studies,
[9]there was, you know, within regulatory agencies and
[10]among scientists in the U.S., there was a
[11]distinction between chrysotile and anthrobole, what
[12]we call asbestos, that was a quantitatively proven
[13]difference in risk of mesothelioma and lung cancer
[14]as well as impacting asbestosis and pleural plaques
[15]so other diseases that have been associated.
[16]So, then again, these decisions on the weight
[17]of evidence and whether to generalize and say, which
[18]IARC did, I think, in 2012, that all forms of
[19]asbestos are essentially equal, and you can't tell
[20]the difference between anthrobles and chrysotiles,
[21]there really is clear and convincing scientific
[22]evidence that there is a difference scientifically,
[23]but they, the work group, workshop group that was
[24]directed to review that decided to come to a
[25]different -- a different final decision which wasn't
  Page 113
[1]really supported by the evidence in a rigorous way.
[2]So, people can disagree with IARC and still
[3]scientifically be accurate, correct and objective in
[4]their own sense, and that's -- that's what we're
[5]pointing out, is that the scientific evidence,
[6]again, can be influenced by people -- people wanting
[7]to kind of do the right thing or do good in a -- a
[8]regulatory complex or concept of, you know, banning
[9]or promoting the banning of asbestos throughout the
[10]world and not allowing countries like Russia or
[11]China to use asbestos because it's too hazardous.
[12]People are going to -- some scientists will
[13]have that opinion and will try to kind of expand the
[14]influence of their -- their decision-making to try
[15]to improve what -- you know, do what they think to
[16]improve the public health situations through
[17]regulatory agencies.
[18]So, again, each -- each decision that gets made
[19]by IARC is -- is not -- not the world's opinion, for
[20]sure, and in some cases it's very different from
[21]what the scientific evidence rigorously would be --
[22]would be interpreted to support, and that's again,
[23]where individuals who are on the work groups can --
[24]can create a big difference in the decision, you
[25]know, the classification decisions for any
  Page 114
[1]particular monograph and/or any particular chemical
[2]entity.
[3]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[4]Q. So, you've -- you've pointed out that not all
[5]of this paper was created and generated by you.
[6]Exponent, years ago, represented the tobacco
[7]industry in the smoking litigation, correct?
[8]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[9]THE WITNESS: I -- I don't know. I'm -- I
[10]don't have any -- I didn't have any direct
[11]connections to Exponent before.
[12]I mean, I've known people who have worked at
[13]Exponent for many years but I didn't really have
[14]a -- a grasp of what they were working on as a
[15]broader scope until I joined the company in 2014.
[16]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[17]Q. Would it surprise you to know that Exponent's
[18]expert witnesses said that secondhand smoke was safe,
[19]although the CDC says that 7,300 people die a year from
[20]secondhand smoke?
[21]Does that surprise you?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and scope.
[23]THE WITNESS: You know, I've actually had
[24]discussions with colleagues about that decision in
[25]the past, and -- basically, the scientific evidence
  Page 115
[1]is -- is relatively weak for that connection between
[2]secondhand smoke in -- in lung cancer risk, and so,
[3]it's reasonable to criticize the EPA when they
[4]utilize kind of weaker evidence to say that X-number
[5]of people die because of somebody else's cigarette
[6]smoking. They don't know that to be true, but you
[7]can use certain studies to support that position and
[8]to make that calculation.
[9]And so, this is another example, just like with
[10]IARC, where public health agencies and people who
[11]think they're doing the right thing will kind of
[12]bastardize the scientific information to purport
[13]that something is true, like, 10,000 people a year
[14]will die, from, you know, secondhand cigarette smoke
[15]and they don't know that to be true. Yet, for the
[16]public health purpose of trying to limit or reduce
[17]people's exposure to smoke, which, you know, a lot
[18]of people can agree that that's a good idea and it's
[19]ultimately where regulation went and the public
[20]wanted it to go, that doesn't mean that the
[21]scientific evidence you might rely on to support the
[22]idea that people are dying from secondhand smoke
[23]is -- is of great quality or of the import that
[24]they've used it for.
[25]So, it's basically this nexus between advocacy,
  Page 116
[1]which is using a piece of scientific evidence to
[2]achieve an outcome and weight of evidence analysis
[3]which might say that that's evidence that isn't
[4]strong enough to make that conclusion that people,
[5]X-number of people are dying because of the
[6]cigarette smoke and secondhand smoke.
[7]It's very different from, you know, among
[8]cigarette smokers, mainstream smoke, saying that
[9]tobacco is not addictive or that tobacco doesn't
[10]cause lung cancer. That's ridiculous, right?
[11]Because there's plenty of scientific evidence that's
[12]strong, consistent and coherent on that nature of
[13]exposure, but when you're talking about secondhand
[14]dose, again, this is toxicology, right? The dose
[15]makes the poison and lower levels of smoke exposure
[16]are much more difficult to assign as being a cause
[17]of lung cancer just on a dose response
[18]consideration.
[19]So, that's how -- that's how it works out, is
[20]that in each case, whether it's IARC or you know,
[21]your claims about, you know, EPA or CDC coming to
[22]decisions about secondhand smoke, there's always the
[23]scientific evidence, but then it gets interpreted in
[24]the context of public health and how -- what we
[25]should do versus what the evidence proves, and
  Page 117
[1]sometimes it gets spun up into a ball of -- you
[2]know, claims of this person is biased and this
[3]person, you know, works for this entity, et cetera,
[4]but in many cases, again, scientists can interpret
[5]the same piece or the same group of scientific
[6]studies and come to different conclusions and it be
[7]totally reasonable, but the person who wants to
[8]achieve an outcome of, you know, stopping everybody
[9]from smoking in bars is -- going to use that
[10]evidence, perhaps, differently, and that's -- that's
[11]how these -- these -- how scientific evidence gets
[12]kind of misapplied or -- or bias gets inserted into
[13]the process rather than it just being a weight of
[14]evidence evaluation.
[15]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[16]Q. So, if you started working for Exponent in
[17]September of 2014 -- is that right?
[18]A. Yeah, November of 2014.
[19]Q. All right, and you're aware that Exponent
[20]provided expert witness service and testimony to Toyota
[21]for their sudden unintended acceleration cases, are you
[22]not?
[23]A. I mean, I vaguely remember that.
[24]I really don't have much interaction with
[25]people in the -- I think it's our Phoenix office. I
  Page 118
[1]don't really have much is interaction with them.
[2]Q. Would you be -- would you be surprised to know
[3]that Exponent's expert witnesses opined that there
[4]wasn't anything wrong with the Toyota cars and it was
[5]user error that these car was having the accidents they
[6]were having?
[7]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and scope.
[8]THE WITNESS: I don't have any reason to -- you
[9]know, to be surprised or not surprised about that.
[10]I'm certain that if there was an opinion put
[11]forward by an Exponent expert that there would have
[12]been very rigorous scientific evidence evaluation
[13]behind that.
[14]So, and again, if it was put out by Exponent,
[15]just like when my put out my opinions, our ISO 9000
[16]rules require that we have, at least, one other, you
[17]know, expert qualified in the field in the specific
[18]area of that expert and of that topic, peer review
[19]it.
[20]And again, when I'm asked to QC somebody else's
[21]report I'm looking for transparency and looking for
[22]a weight of evidence, I'm looking for good
[23]methodology and good quality critique of the
[24]scientific evidence, and so, I would expect that any
[25]opinions that are put out by Exponent's experts
  Page 119
[1]would be scientifically well qualified.
[2]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[3]Q. And your example of peer review of your expert
[4]reports in this case, the Smith & Nephew hip case, that
[5]was done by the employees of Exponent which was Ann
[6]Locosano and Ellen Chang, right?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. All right, and are you aware that in the Toyota
[9]unintended acceleration cases that Toyota ultimately
[10]entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the
[11]federal government to avoid criminal charges?
[12]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and scope.
[13]THE WITNESS: I don't -- I have no idea.
[14]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[15]Q. And so, you're not aware that they had to
[16]admit, in that deferred prosecution agreement, that they
[17]misled consumers about the defect?
[18]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[19]THE WITNESS: I'm not familiar with that.
[20]MR. MATHEWS: Cami I know it's a little bit
[21]early but can we take a another break.
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Yeah. No, that's great.
[23]Are we thinking we're going to keep going or do
[24]we want to break for lunch?
[25]MR. MATHEWS: I will -- well, let's go off the
  Page 120
[1]record and then we'll talk about it.
[2]MS. CAPODICE: Okay.
[3]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record 12:47.
[4](Recess taken)
[5](After recess)
[6]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video record at
[7]1:48.
[8]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[9]Q. All right. Doctor, I'd asked you earlier today
[10]about documents you had received from Smith & Nephew or
[11]documents you had asked for or hadn't been provided, and
[12]I think you indicated you hadn't necessarily seen any
[13]internal documents from Smith & Nephew, is that correct?
[14]A. That's right.
[15]MR. MATHEWS: Okay, and let me -- I want to go
[16]and take you through a few of them here if I can.
[17]Okay, and what exhibit number are we up to?
[18]MS. CAPODICE: I think we're on 7.
[19]MR. MATHEWS: 7, okay.
[20]THE COURT REPORTER: That's right.
[21]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[22]Q. So, Doctor, you would agree with me for a
[23]company to be able to monitor or do their post-marketing
[24]surveillance and monitor their products correctly, they
[25]would need to have accurate information, correct?
  Page 121
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and outside
[2]the scope of this expert report.
[3]THE WITNESS: I'd agree that would be the
[4]preference.
[5]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[6]Q. All right, and if the -- well, let me ask you
[7]this question.
[8]If you're running a scientific study, you need
[9]that study to include the absolute best data that's
[10]available, correct?
[11]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[12]THE WITNESS: That's what you hope for is to
[13]generate the best data.
[14]MR. MATHEWS:
[15]Q. And I'm going to show you what's been marked as
[16]Exhibit or we'll mark it as Exhibit Number 7, and this
[17]is an email chain, February the 8th, 2006, where we see
[18]Nicki Tildesley -- I'm sure I pronounced that wrong --
[19]communicating with -- internally, at Smith & Nephew, and
[20]she says, there are a hundred reported revisions in this
[21]file but I am convinced there are more revisions which
[22]have not been reported.
[23]Do you see that?
[24]A. Yeah, okay.
[25]Q. In performing expert witness services for a
  Page 122
[1]client, would it be important for you to know that that
[2]company was basing their decisions on the best data
[3]that's available at the time?
[4]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[5]THE WITNESS: I'm -- I'm generally not the
[6]person to ask about company conduct. I'm mainly
[7]concerned about scientific evidence so, I'm --
[8]again, conduct of individuals within a company is
[9]not what I'm asked to look at here in general.
[10]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[11]Q. Is it important to you, as an expert witness,
[12]to do business with companies that follow proper
[13]procedures and guidelines in the medical device
[14]business?
[15]A. I don't have any criteria for how companies
[16]behave that I use, you know, from a business perspective
[17]or professional perspective.
[18]Again, what I'm asked to look at is scientific
[19]evidence and it has nothing to do with decisions or
[20]personalities that individuals in a company -- in a
[21]company might make.
[22]Q. Certainly, not personalities of individuals,
[23]but isn't it important to you, as an expert witness, to
[24]work for companies that don't somehow damage your
[25]reputation by -- simply by being associated with them?
  Page 123
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[2]THE WITNESS: I guess that's a business
[3]consideration, sure.
[4]Like working for a tobacco company or something
[5]like that, that certainly is what -- what --
[6]Exponent would not allow me to work for a tobacco
[7]company even if I wanted to because of the
[8]reputational risks.
[9](Plaintiff's Exhibit 7, marked for
[10]identification)
[11]MR. MATHEWS: All right, let me show you what's
[12]been marked as -- I'll mark it as Exhibit 8.
[13](Plaintiff's Exhibit 8, marked for
[14]identification)
[15]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[16]Q. And I'll tell you, this is an email from Tim
[17]Band to Roger Ashton, back in July of 2008, another
[18]internal document of Smith & Nephew's that's an email.
[19]And you understand the BHR product was an
[20]important product to Smith & Nephew's profit at the end
[21]of the year? Do you have an understanding of that?
[22]A. I don't.
[23]Q. All right. Do you understand that BHR was an
[24]important product in their product line for them from a
[25]profit standpoint?
  Page 124
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and outside
[2]the scope of his expertise.
[3]THE WITNESS: No, I -- I have no idea. It's
[4]not what I was asked to look at.
[5]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[6]Q. All right, and you've been deal dealing with
[7]product, medical product device manufacturers for
[8]30 years, right?
[9]A. No.
[10]Q. How long have you been dealing with product --
[11]medical product device manufacturers?
[12]A. So, dealing with, means what?.
[13]Q. How long have you been providing expert witness
[14]services for medical device manufacturers?
[15]A. I don't recall anything prior to about 2012.
[16]Q. So, for the last eight years you've been
[17]dealing with medical device manufacturers in an expert
[18]witness capacity?
[19]A. No, and I think we went over that, that I did
[20]research work for the most part in my time spent at
[21]Cardno, Cardno ChemRisk and ChemRisk, and then I only,
[22]had one other project that I actually worked on that was
[23]expert witness activity for -- and it was only for
[24]Smith & Nephew at Exponent.
[25]So, I've worked on one other litigation case
  Page 125
[1]among all the research that I've done over the past
[2]eight years. I've done the McAnany case and now this
[3]one.
[4]Q. And you have done no other research or provided
[5]any expert witness testimony for any other medical
[6]device manufacturers in that time?
[7]A. No. I think it's really been isolated to the
[8]research work that I did, which we talked about was, in
[9]part, for DePuy.
[10]But I haven't done any actual expert witness
[11]work for medical device companies other than those two
[12]in my recollection.
[13]Q. You would agree with me that a medical device
[14]manufacturer should put the safety of the patient over
[15]the profits of the company, correct?
[16]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[17]THE WITNESS: I -- I agree that they should
[18]always have a good -- a good set of information to
[19]rely on to judge safety.
[20]Again, my -- my concern is not profits or -- or
[21]marketing people, what their opinions might be.
[22]Mine is evaluating -- my scope is evaluating
[23]scientific information and assessing whether or not
[24]there's safety considerations, or in particular,
[25]toxicological problems or issues that might be
  Page 126
[1]present or might need to be acted on.
[2]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[3]Q. I think this is Exhibit 8 that I've pulled up
[4]here, this exhibit from July 1, 2008. I'm going go to
[5]page 11.
[6]Does it concern you that a company would refer
[7]to one of their products as a cash cow?
[8]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[9]MR. MATHEWS: Oh, sorry.
[10]MS. CAPODICE: Sorry. Go ahead.
[11]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[12]Q. And leave it as current specification and let
[13]it run its course, does that statement concern you, from
[14]a stay safety standpoint and the company putting its
[15]profits over the -- over consumer safety?
[16]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[17]THE WITNESS: I -- I don't know.
[18]I wouldn't want to comment on that one snippet,
[19]and then again it's not --
[20]MR. MATHEWS: Okay.
[21]THE WITNESS: -- something that -- scientific
[22]evidence and whether or not there was, you know, a
[23]problem being ignored, that might be in the scope of
[24]my work, but what people -- what people say is not
[25]my scope of work here.
  Page 127
[1]MR. MATHEWS: Okay, and I will remind you, just
[2]so it's clear this was in 2008, July 1, 2008, that
[3]this was -- this document was sent to Tim Band.
[4]What we'll mark as Exhibit 9, is another email
[5]from Tim Band, some three and a half, almost four
[6]years later.
[7](Plaintiff's Exhibit 9, marked for
[8]identification)
[9]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[10]Q. And I'm going to forward you to page 7 of that
[11]document, and almost four years later they're still
[12]referring to this BHR product as a cash cow and that
[13]they need to milk the cash cow.
[14]Do you see that?
[15]A. I see those words.
[16]Q. And down here, on the right-hand side of this
[17]same slide, page 7 of Exhibit 9, we see one of the
[18]things they're talking about doing is replacing the BHR
[19]ultimately.
[20]Do you see that?
[21]A. I see those words, yes.
[22]Q. Anybody ever talk to you, during your course of
[23]being an expert witness in this case, about their need
[24]to replace the BHR product at some point?
[25]MS. CAPODICE: I object to the form, and I also
  Page 128
[1]object because that intrudes upon the attorney
[2]work-product privilege.
[3]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[4]Q. Outside of the communications and discussion
[5]with the attorneys, anybody at Smith & Nephew ever talk
[6]to you about the need to replace the BHR system at some
[7]point?
[8]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[9]THE WITNESS: I -- I don't -- I don't recall
[10]ever speaking with anybody at Smith & Nephew.
[11]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[12]Q. All right. Let me go back -- let's see --
[13]let's go back in time back to 2010, September of 2010.
[14]And again, this is an internal email
[15]communication, Joe Devivo, John Soto, and Mark Wogue --
[16]I'm sure I pronounced that wrong, too -- and we'll see
[17]down here towards the bottom of this email, they're
[18]talking about things they need to do to convince doctors
[19]that they're being irresponsible in deterring active
[20]male patients from their best treatment choice.
[21]Do you see that in this email?
[22]A. What words are you wanting me to look at?
[23]Q. Yeah, it's number 1 there on your screen.
[24]Towards the end of number 1, they're talking
[25]about the detractors should be warned they are being
  Page 129
[1]irresponsible in deterring active male patients from
[2]their best treatment choice.
[3]Do you see that?
[4]A. Yes, I see that.
[5]Q. All right, and then further down there, number
[6]4, they say, Oxford needs to be embarrassed by their
[7]inadequate surgery.
[8]Do you see that?
[9]A. I do see that those words.
[10]Q. And so, this is internal communications where
[11]they're basically trying to come up with a plan to get
[12]surgeons, and basically, bully surgeons into using their
[13]BHR product in active male patients.
[14]Do you see that?
[15]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form. The document
[16]speaks for itself.
[17]THE WITNESS: I think you've inferred a lot
[18]there.
[19]Again, the document says what it says, you
[20]know. I don't think it's talking about science in
[21]any way so I don't really have an opinion about it.
[22]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[23]Q. Okay, and if we go back up here, Joe Devivo's
[24]response is, you two need to grow a pair and did defend
[25]your business. Do exactly what Ronan says or I'll get
  Page 130
[1]someone who does.
[2]Does that seem like the type of behavior you
[3]would expect from executives within a medical device
[4]company?
[5]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[6]THE WITNESS: I don't know. I -- I don't know
[7]anything about who said that or who these people are
[8]so I can't comment on it.
[9]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[10]Q. Is that the type of behavior and communication
[11]from a company -- is that the type of company you want
[12]to work with, is a company that treats their employees
[13]this way?
[14]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[15]THE WITNESS: I -- and again, I don't really
[16]have any -- anything to say about -- about this,
[17]these emails.
[18]MR. MATHEWS: Okay, let me move you forward
[19]then to May of 2011.
[20]We'll mark this as Exhibit 10.
[21](Plaintiff's Exhibit 10, marked for
[22]identification)
[23]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[24]Q. I want to scroll down here towards the bottom.
[25]This is another internal document, email, where
  Page 131
[1]they're talking about BHR ad hoc data request, and
[2]they're talking about modifying the BHR labeling, and --
[3]MR. MATHEWS: Hang on just a second. Let me
[4]blow this up so it's easier to read.
[5]I may have blown it up too much.
[6]Can you guys see all that or is it too big?
[7]All right, there we go.
[8]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[9]Q. -- modifying the is BHR labeling to include the
[10]helpful information related to smaller size components.
[11]So, this is with the concern of the implant in
[12]women and the smaller head size men, and they're talking
[13]about modifying the BHR labeling.
[14]And then, Dave Telling says to Bill Aubrey,
[15]U.S. IFU change only.
[16]Bill Aubrey then asked, can we get away with
[17]not putting it in ours when we are aware of a risk?
[18]So, he's asking does it only have to be in the
[19]U.S. change or do they need to include it everywhere.
[20]Would you expect a medical device company to
[21]limit the warnings that they're providing to certain
[22]parts of the world?
[23]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form, and also
[24]outside this expert's area of expertise.
[25]THE WITNESS: I don't know. You know, it
  Page 132
[1]depends on at lot of specifics I would imagine.
[2]You know that -- I know that, at least, for the
[3]BHR, the McAnany cohorts and data generated from
[4]that is different, in ways, from what might have
[5]been observed elsewhere, and there's valid
[6]consideration then if there's different patterns of
[7]potential issues pertaining to, for example, this
[8]dislocation risk in different populations that
[9]relates to physician-related, in other words,
[10]implant surgery placement related issues.
[11]It might be reasonable to warn in one place and
[12]not warn in the other because the data on different
[13]populations or with different providers of these --
[14]of the surgery services may generate different
[15]outcomes.
[16]So, it wouldn't surprise me that there -- that
[17]there is or there could be comments or questions
[18]reasonably raised about that issue.
[19]So, again, that's not my scope, but
[20]scientifically, there is reason to expect there
[21]could be differences that are population-specific or
[22]surgeon-cohort specific.
[23]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[24]Q. Scientifically, wouldn't you want a medical
[25]device manufacturer to warn, to overwarn rather than not
  Page 133
[1]warn or underwarn?
[2]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[3]THE WITNESS: Well, I think the tendency, you
[4]know, whether it's medical devices or drugs is, at
[5]least, through FDA and their procedures, is to
[6]overwarn.
[7]Now, outside of the U.S. I really don't have a
[8]good context for that.
[9]But certainly the rules and how the rules and
[10]regulations are played out by FDA, I think there's a
[11]tendency to overwarn and most -- and most drug and
[12]medical device manufacturers follow that regulatory
[13]requirement.
[14]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[15]Q. Do you have an opinion as to why a company
[16]would not want to overwarn?
[17]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form. Outside the
[18]scope of this expert's area of expertise.
[19]THE WITNESS: No, I don't.
[20]MR. MATHEWS: Move on to October 10, 2012, and
[21]what exhibit are we up to? Is this 10 or 11?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: I think it's 11.
[23]THE COURT REPORTER: No, this will be 10.
[24]MR. MATHEWS: 10, all right.
[25](Plaintiff's Exhibit 11 marked for
  Page 134
[1]identification)
[2]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[3]Q. And this is an email from Andy Hardison, an
[4]internal document.
[5]He's in charge of safety affairs for the
[6]company and in -- well, I'll let you read this and
[7]then -- let me make sure there's no more -- and then
[8]I'll ask you some questions about it.
[9]A. You just want me to read the highlighted part?
[10]Q. No, you can read the whole thing. You don't
[11]need to read it out loud. I just want you to be
[12]familiar with the document.
[13]A. I read.
[14]Q. All right. So, in this document they're
[15]discussing the need or lack thereof, to change -- of the
[16]metal-on-metal application as it relates to the
[17]Birmingham Hip modular heads in the United States,
[18]correct?
[19]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form. Outside the
[20]scope of this expert's area of expertise, and you're
[21]also asking about a document that's outside of the
[22]scope of this litigation.
[23]Subject to all those objections, you are
[24]welcome to answer.
[25]THE WITNESS: I -- I don't know. I think, you
  Page 135
[1]know, in my last set of answers we talked about that
[2]each regulatory agency, whether it's FDA in the U.S.
[3]or you know, the European entities, the equivalents
[4]of that has their own procedures and nuances, and
[5]so, it looks, to me, from reading that memo, that
[6]they're pointing to one of the nuances of U.S.
[7]regulation through the FDA that kind of makes the
[8]warning point moot, it appears.
[9]So, I'm not sure if that answers your question,
[10]but you know, again, I -- this wasn't part of what I
[11]was asked to -- to evaluate.
[12]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[13]Q. So, in this document that's an internal
[14]Smith & Nephew document, they indicate that they know
[15]that the metal-on-metal application is being used
[16]off-label and they're making a decision not to update
[17]the IFU.
[18]Would you expect a medical device company to
[19]warn consumers and doctors when they -- of an issue with
[20]the product when they know the product is being used
[21]off-label?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and scope, and
[23]foundation.
[24]THE WITNESS: I don't know.
[25]This is not something I'm comfortable
  Page 136
[1]testifying about because I don't have enough context
[2]and it's not something I'm prepared to talk about.
[3]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[4]Q. April of 2013 there's --
[5]MR. MATHEWS: This will be Exhibit 12.
[6](Plaintiff's Exhibit 12, marked for
[7]identification)
[8]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[9]Q. -- there's an exchange between Tim Band and
[10]Peter Brooks where they're discussing the way that
[11]certain components are being processed, and in it they
[12]refer to being in a room where there were three young
[13]oriental people busily picking grit from between the
[14]beads of your BHR sockets.
[15]Do you see that?
[16]A. I see those words.
[17]Q. Is Smith & Nephew -- is -- well, is a company
[18]that abuse -- abuses their employees, using racial slurs
[19]to discuss people working for them, is that the type of
[20]company you want to be providing expert witness services
[21]for?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form and outside
[23]the scope of this expert's area of expertise and the
[24]document speaks for itself.
[25]THE WITNESS: I think, you know, based on those
  Page 137
[1]words, I -- I don't really have any -- any context
[2]for that, you know, for you framing the question
[3]like that nor do I have a specific opinion about it.
[4]Again, it doesn't raise any scientific issues
[5]that I can evaluate or that relate to toxicology,
[6]and my job is not to judge companies, as a whole,
[7]based on what some person's speaking would be in a
[8]memo.
[9]My job is to evaluate scientific evidence and
[10]advise on the veracity of that evidence within my
[11]area of expertise, and that's -- that's what I'm
[12]doing in this case.
[13]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[14]Q. Let me ask you about -- and see if you have a
[15]different answer as to their treatment when it comes to
[16]women.
[17]I'm going to have a January 23, 2015 email from
[18]Greg Williams to bill Aubrey where they're discussing
[19]BHR, and they're asking about what's going to be
[20]happening with it, and they get to the point where
[21]they're talking about they're going to have to pull it
[22]back and repackage but withdraw the sizes 48 and
[23]smaller, and how that's going to affect the U.S. market.
[24]They go on to discuss Dave Telling, who's
[25]their superior, about how he's got too much time on his
  Page 138
[1]hands.
[2]He's asked to go to Germany, and then they
[3]begin discussing Kerry, his female employee that works
[4]for him, saying, she does most of the work, and then
[5]he -- they say, to be honest, I think if he went on
[6]holiday for six months you wouldn't see much difference.
[7]And then Greg Williams says, get him to do more
[8]so Kerry can come down and give me a dot dot dot dot
[9]hand. Bill Aubrey says, now, less of that. She will be
[10]busy with me. Yeah, but that will talk about three
[11]minutes, right. Bill Aubrey says, four, at the most.
[12]They're discussing Kerry, the female employee,
[13]giving both of them a hand job on an internal
[14]communication system at the company.
[15]Is that the type of behavior that you expect
[16]from a medical device company?
[17]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form. Outside the
[18]scope of this expert's area of expertise.
[19]THE WITNESS: I don't -- I don't see hand job
[20]in there. I see dot dot dot hand, but again, I -- I
[21]guess you could read that into it.
[22]That's locker-room talk type of interaction
[23]interchange that doesn't seem very professional.
[24]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[25]Q. And is that the kind of company that you want
  Page 139
[1]to provide expert witness s services for whenever they
[2]have people inside their organization behaving this way?
[3]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[4]THE WITNESS:. Again, it's not my job to
[5]judge -- judge a company's reputation and whether I
[6]want the work for them based on individual employee
[7]mis -- you know, poor quality of -- poor political
[8]correctness of -- of their emails.
[9]It isn't -- it's -- my job is to do my best, as
[10]a scientist, to advise them on scientific issues
[11]that come up. That's what I've done here.
[12]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[13]Q. Let me ask you a scientific issue then.
[14]As a toxicologist you run studies from time to
[15]time, correct?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. All right. Have any of those studies ever
[18]involved your need to utilize human tissue and/or bones
[19]for the study?
[20]A. Are you just talking about it ever in any
[21]situation or are we talking about hip implants?
[22]What are we -- what are you talking about?
[23]Q. Well, let's talk about hip implants, but I
[24]think you told me you hadn't run any laboratory studies
[25]as it relates to hip implants.
  Page 140
[1]Is that correct?
[2]A. That's right.
[3]Q. Okay, so -- well, let me ask you this.
[4]You're familiar with Dr. McMinn, correct?
[5]A. I -- I know who he is. I've never met him nor
[6]do I know him in any detail.
[7]Q. And again, he's the person who invented the BHR
[8]resurfacing hip components that we're discussing today,
[9]correct?
[10]A. That's my understanding.
[11]MR. MATHEWS: All right, and I'll mark this as
[12]Exhibit 12.
[13](Plaintiff's Exhibit 13, marked for
[14]identification)
[15](Plaintiff's Exhibit 14, marked for
[16]identification.)
[17](Plaintiff's Exhibit 15, marked for
[18]identification.)
[19]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[20]Q. Are you aware that it's recently come to light
[21]that Dr. McMinn was hoarding over 5,000 bone samples
[22]part of which were kept at his farmhouse in rural
[23]England or were you aware that those accusations had
[24]been made?
[25]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form, foundation
  Page 141
[1]and scope.
[2]THE WITNESS: No.
[3]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[4]Q. As a scientist who's conducted numerous
[5]studies, is there any reason, in your mind, that you
[6]could think a doctor would need to maintain over
[7]5,000 bone samples over a period of 25 years --
[8]MS. CAPODICE: Objection.
[9]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[10]Q. -- outside of their medical facility?
[11]MR. MATHEWS: Sorry.
[12]THE WITNESS: I don't know. I don't what his
[13]rationale might have been or if it even happened,
[14]but I have no idea.
[15]MR. MATHEWS: All right --
[16]MS. CAPODICE: Todd, I think by the protocol
[17]we're supposed to be given copies of everything that
[18]you've been using as exhibits.
[19]Is there any way you can upload those various
[20]exhibits into the Chat?
[21]MR. MATHEWS: Yeah. Let me -- I'm sure there
[22]is.
[23]Why don't we do this, let's -- because I'm
[24]going to need to use the restroom -- let's take a
[25]quick break and I'll do that at the same time, okay?
  Page 142
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Very nice. Thank you so much.
[2]MR. MATHEWS: Yes.
[3]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record 2:21.
[4](Recess taken)
[5](After recess)
[6]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video record
[7]2:37.
[8]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[9]Q. Doctor, I may have asked you this earlier
[10]today. If I did, I apologize.
[11]As to your opinions in this case, are they all
[12]stated in your report?
[13]A. Yes. All the -- the central opinions about
[14]general causation, and you know, what I've been asked to
[15]evaluate to date.
[16]Q. And you haven't been asked to give any
[17]additional opinions that aren't contained in this report
[18]for this case, correct?
[19]A. Not that I recall.
[20]Q. Okay, and Doctor, I wanted to clarify one
[21]thing.
[22]You might recall the questions I asked you
[23]about your opinion whenever it came to looking at
[24]studies and who had paid for those, and to summarize
[25]that quickly, I think you said you look at the science
  Page 143
[1]involved in those studies, not necessarily the ultimate
[2]opinions that are given in those, is that correct?
[3]A. No, I look at the whole paper which includes
[4]the methodology, the results and the interpretation.
[5]So, I review the opinions but in terms of doing
[6]my evidence analysis I don't hang on the words or rely,
[7]necessarily, on the words of the author's
[8]interpretation.
[9]Again, the intent is to present the methodology
[10]and the data so that people with different perspectives
[11]can evaluate the data for themselves in the scientific
[12]literature.
[13]So, that's what I do. I certainly, you know,
[14]note, and in some cases, give credit to interpretations
[15]being correct and sometimes they're over -- overstated
[16]or not correctly stated in my view, but that -- it's all
[17]on an individual study basis that I make those
[18]evaluations.
[19]And then tying together all of the scientific
[20]literature on a particular topic is what is -- is my job
[21]as an independent scientist to tie the relevant pieces
[22]together.
[23]Q. During that conversation you mentioned a couple
[24]of plaintiffs' experts by name.
[25]If you see a study that's conducted by someone
  Page 144
[1]you determined to be a plaintiff's expert, you'd give
[2]that study less credibility or less weight than you
[3]would from a study done by someone in the industry,
[4]correct?
[5]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[6]THE WITNESS: No.
[7]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[8]Q. All right. Let me see if I can summarize, a
[9]little bit about -- just so I make sure I have your
[10]opinion clear.
[11]For a metal-on-metal device they do have the
[12]ability to release -- release cobalt and chromium ions
[13]but if they're implanted correctly or don't have one of
[14]the other issues that you identified, such as genetic
[15]predisposition, dislocation -- you went through a litany
[16]of those -- if it doesn't have one of those unique
[17]features to it, the amount of ions released isn't enough
[18]to cause physical harm.
[19]Is that your position?
[20]A. I'd say the weight of evidence for normal
[21]functioning implants is that there isn't any -- any
[22]evidence showing cobalt-or-chromium-related toxicity,
[23]and again, we've distinguished that from what could be
[24]particle-related foreign body reactions of the body and
[25]other injuries or individual-specific issues that can
  Page 145
[1]affect fixation and in -- in -- in chain -- in chain
[2]reaction, essentially, change what the function, in
[3]terms of wear of the implant, would be.
[4]It's not a straightforward, and it is really --
[5]it's difficult to give generalized opinions.
[6]You know, we haven't talked about
[7]hypersensitivity, which is mentioned in -- in fairly --
[8]fairly good detail in my report.
[9]Then again, there are scientific questions
[10]regarding there being a particular role for cobalt or
[11]chromium in certain types of allergic responses that
[12]have been looked at in the literature pertaining to hip
[13]implants, in particular.
[14]All I can say is that, you know, the weight of
[15]evidence is distinctly different for many specific
[16]questions that -- relating to both bare particles and
[17]specific metals and the issues I've -- I've discussed in
[18]my report.
[19]And I've tried to lay it out as balanced and
[20]objectively as I can so that it takes, either a very
[21]unusual individual in terms of the hypersensitivity
[22]response, in other words, a rare occurrence of an
[23]allergic reaction or a hyper inflammatory response that
[24]can happen in people with certain genetic or disease
[25]states or it takes an extraordinary profile of -- of
  Page 146
[1]where debris generation, which, again, only happens
[2]in -- in malfunctioning implants or damaged implants or
[3]poorly -- poorly placed implants based on the
[4]literature.
[5]The body has certain defense mechanisms. They
[6]include protein binding. It includes macrophage and
[7]other immune cell interactions that help to either
[8]eliminate or isolate larger particulates, and the body
[9]also gets rids of the cobalt and chromium through
[10]circulation through -- through the kidneys.
[11]So the homeostasis that is -- that the body
[12]puts forward to be able to tolerate small amounts of
[13]wear debris volume, such as that happening with BHR or
[14]other metal-on-metal hip implants when -- when implanted
[15]properly, that homeo -- those homeostatic mechanisms are
[16]what I described and what I base my primary opinions on
[17]with respect to normal function and the fact that cobalt
[18]and chromium toxicity, what we refer to as cobalt ions
[19]or chromium ions, toxicity relating specifically to
[20]those metals is quite rare and not -- not the -- not
[21]commonplace or frequent in terms of the hazard posed by
[22]BHR against -- among the literature review.
[23]Q. So, is it fair to say, then, from a toxicology
[24]standpoint, that it's your opinion that any injury that
[25]a patient were to suffer from cobalt or chromium
  Page 147
[1]elevated ions has nothing to do with Smith & Nephew but
[2]only has to do with the way the device implanted or some
[3]sort of -- something that's unique to the patient such
[4]as genetic predisposition, hypersensitivity or a
[5]dislocation has occurred that has caused some sort of
[6]physical change in the functionality of the hip?
[7]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[8]THE WITNESS: I wouldn't care to generalize
[9]that broadly, you know, that any -- any particular
[10]problem wouldn't be, you know, related to the -- to
[11]the implant or the cobalt and chromium.
[12]I have reviewed, in my report, certain cases of
[13]hip implants, where it was ground down to a nub,
[14]like, several grams of cobalt and chromium were
[15]released in -- in actual examples of cases.
[16]So, we come along a case like that, where we've
[17]got, for example, in the Zeiwiel case where we had a
[18]cardiomyopathy death related to losing some 26 grams
[19]of -- of cobalt chromium in a metal-on-polyethylene
[20]implant and what cobalt concentrations were over
[21]6,000 micrograms per liter there would be no
[22]question that metal toxicity was part of the problem
[23]there. But, in a -- in again, the vast majority of
[24]cases you don't see that type of dramatic
[25]dissemination of either wear debris and/or cobalt
  Page 148
[1]and chromium.
[2]So, it all depends on what the situation is and
[3]what the circumstances tell us would be the
[4]plausible cobalt or chromium related effects.
[5]I acknowledged in my report that that kind of
[6]levels, say, 300 to 600 micrograms per liter or
[7]higher in the blood, there is a greater likelihood
[8]of seeing, at least, the temporary effects of cobalt
[9]toxicity systematically.
[10]But again, those seem to be based on the
[11]literature reports that those types of interactions
[12]raising the cobalt levels that high, I don't think
[13]I've seen any such elevated level reported for a BHR
[14]implant, and -- but it's possible it happened, so I
[15]wouldn't necessarily rule out any -- or make any
[16]broad generalization that it couldn't -- couldn't or
[17]wouldn't ever happen, but I always want to base my
[18]opinions on the most specific information and
[19]details about the individual, the implant and the
[20]toxicology relevant information as I can.
[21]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[22]Q. Okay. Is it your opinion, based on the earlier
[23]discussion we had, that the reason metal-on-metal hip
[24]implants have been taken off the market is because of
[25]the doctors and lawyers and not because of the science
  Page 149
[1]that supports the position that cobalt and chromium are
[2]released from metal-on-metal hips that are implanted
[3]completely correctly and don't have any unique
[4]generic -- genetic dispositions?
[5]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[6]THE WITNESS: Can you break that down?
[7]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[8]Q. Sure.
[9]We talked -- we talked about the halo effect
[10]and your position basically being that doctors were
[11]afraid of putting in metal-on-metal because there was
[12]this halo or spillover effect that was going on and
[13]lawyers pushing litigation because of revision rates
[14]going up that really had nothing to do with the failure
[15]of the product but had to do, basically, with the
[16]hysteria surrounding that product.
[17]So, my question is, is it your position that
[18]doctors at lawyers are driving these products to be
[19]taken off the market rather than the science that
[20]supports cobalt and chromium causing metallosis in these
[21]patients?
[22]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[23]THE WITNESS: I think there's contributions of
[24]both the scientific evidence and what you just
[25]described as spillover effects that impact medical
  Page 150
[1]decision-making including decision-making by
[2]companies to withdraw product.
[3]It's never one thing, and the science, again,
[4]it's -- for each implant the specific evidence of
[5]the failures or the reasons for the failures are --
[6]are distinctly different just as they are for BHR
[7]versus the THR metal-on-metal hip implants.
[8]So, in that paper, as we discussed, was about
[9]over-generalizing, and I wouldn't want to
[10]over-generalize theory, but certainly, there are
[11]always going to be liability and kind of other
[12]non-scientific-based elements of the decision to
[13]withdraw product and it really should be the
[14]evidence pertaining to that specific product that
[15]would be -- would be the strongest scientific
[16]information that would be of value for making a
[17]decision based on the science.
[18]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[19]Q. Then you would agree with me that if you were
[20]to do all this work for Smith & Nephew, create a report
[21]and that report was contrary to the position of
[22]Smith & Nephew, that that would prohibit you from
[23]getting additional business from Smith & Nephew or other
[24]metal-on-metal hip manufacturers in the future?
[25]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
  Page 151
[1]THE WITNESS: I -- I'm not sure what -- what
[2]you're asking me.
[3]Is that, that I would make my opinions so that
[4]they don't hurt other manufacturers or --
[5]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[6]Q. Let me ask -- let me ask it again.
[7]You were hired by Smith & Nephew to provide an
[8]expert opinion in this case, correct?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. All right, and if the opinion you gave in this
[11]case were contrary to Smith & Nephew's position in this
[12]case that would prevent you from getting additional
[13]business from Smith & Nephew in the future, correct?
[14]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[15]THE WITNESS: I don't know. A little too vague
[16]for me to know what you mean.
[17]BY MR. MATHEWS:
[18]Q. You told me, in the beginning, that part of
[19]your job as a principal scientist is to develop
[20]business, correct?
[21]A. True.
[22]Q. All right, and you would agree with me that
[23]there's less likelihood that you would develop business
[24]from a client that you had provided an adverse report to
[25]in the past, correct?
  Page 152
[1]MS. CAPODICE: Objection to form.
[2]THE WITNESS: What I said, I think, was that,
[3]in general, I don't take on projects that would have
[4]that type of issue, because number one, they
[5]wouldn't want to pay for me to come up with a
[6]problem -- problematic opinion because the
[7]scientific literature they presume would -- I
[8]presume they already know that there are strong
[9]adverse opinion opinions to that and I wouldn't ever
[10]try to denigrate my own reputation or that of
[11]Exponent by -- by giving opinions that are contrary
[12]to what the scientific evidence indicates.
[13]So, whether -- whether it's Smith & Nephew
[14]would hire me again is kind of a moot point.
[15]I won't to continue to be able to do toxicology
[16]work in the broad array of types of projects that I
[17]do and if the scientific evidence is contrary to
[18]them then it -- that's the way it is and I would
[19]advise them as such and they probably wouldn't have
[20]me testify.
[21]I don't know if that would exclude me from
[22]advising them in the future or future or not.
[23]MR. MATHEWS: All right, thank you, Doctor.
[24]I have no further questions.
[25]MS. CAPODICE: Can we just take a short break,
  Page 153
[1]go off the record?
[2]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record 2:55.
[3](Recess taken)
[4](After recess)
[5]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video record
[6]2:57.
[7]MS. CAPODICE: All right, Todd, you're all
[8]done?
[9]You're muted.
[10]MR. MATHEWS: Yes, I'm done.
[11]MS. CAPODICE: Okay.
[12]MR. MATHEWS: Yes.
[13]MS. CAPODICE: All right, Doctor Kerger, I just
[14]have a couple of quick follow-up questions.
[15]CROSS EXAMINATION
[16]BY MS. CAPODICE:
[17]Q. You were shown a handful of emails that were
[18]cherry picked by plaintiff's counsel out of the millions
[19]of pages of documents that have been produced in this
[20]litigation.
[21]Did any of those emails or documents change
[22]your toxicology opinions that you've given in this case?
[23]MR. MATHEWS: Object to form. Leading.
[24]THE WITNESS: No.
[25]BY MS. CAPODICE:
  Page 154
[1]Q. Sorry. Was that a no? You're a little quiet.
[2]A. No.
[3]Q. All right. And you've been questioned for, I
[4]guess, almost five hours, at this point, by very
[5]competent counsel for the plaintiffs.
[6]Have any of those questions changed your
[7]opinions that you put forth in your August 28, 2020
[8]report?
[9]A. No.
[10]MS. CAPODICE: Then I have nothing further for
[11]you and I think very much for your time today.
[12]THE WITNESS: Thank you
