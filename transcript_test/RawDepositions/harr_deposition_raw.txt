[21]Q And when did that occur?
[22]A June 26, 2014, which was, therefore,
[23]approximately two years ago.
[24]Q Doctor, before we get into your report, I just
[25]wanted to ask you about your -- you do CMEs in your
[8]
[1]practice, but it's not a large part of your practice; is
[2]that correct?
[3]A No, it's actually a minor part of my practice.
[4]I do maybe between 32 and 36 or 7 per year.
[5]Q Okay. So that's basically, you know, just a
[6]couple of months really at most or maybe three a month?
[7]A Yeah, we've looked at it. It probably
[8]averages about three to four a month.
[9]Q Okay. And obviously you charge for this -- to
[10]perform an examination?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q And in addition to the charge for performing
[13]the examination, you also review whatever medical
[14]records and films are associated with the file?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q And that, of course, takes a lot of time as
[17]well?
[18]A Well, reviewing the records and images studies
[19]probably takes most of the time for one of these
[20]examinations that have to be done because we have
[21]usually a very copious amount of past medical records.
[22]And, for instance, these are the past medical records
[23]here that I have reviewed, these looseleaf notebooks.
[24]These are, in other words, past records by other
[25]physicians, other practitioners, not me.
[9]
[1]Q And you also are here today for a video
[2]deposition for the trial that's scheduled in July
[3]because I believe that you are on vacation at that time
[4]and were taking your -- or unavailable for whatever
[5]reason but were taking your video deposition, correct?
[6]A That's my understanding as well.
[7]Q All right. Doctor, I don't think that you
[8]have ever testified for me in a trial before. Based on
[9]your recollection, would that be a fair statement?
[10]A Yes,
[11]Q All right. Let's go to the -- well, before --
[12]you are charging for this video deposition and so the
[13]jury knows, what do you charge for a video depo?
[14]A Video deposition is $ 975 per hour and
[15]additional two hours for preparation, which is at a much
[16]lower rate of about $ 375 an hour.
[17]Q All right. Doctor, let's go to your report.
[18]And I know that you took a past medical history and that
[19]she gave you a chief complaint of prior neck pain, but
[20]you took a history of present illness and I wanted to go
[21]through that with you. The first thing that I wanted
[22]you to discuss was the issue of the fact that she was --
[23]she came to your office having taken Flexeril that
[24]morning, and you made an indication in the first
[25]paragraph of your report as to your opinions regarding
[10]
[1]that. Do you recall that?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q And what did you -- what was your opinion
[4]regarding her taking Flexed' at that time?
[5]A She indicated still taking Flexeril and taking
[6]it in fact the morning of this examination, which I
[7]questioned because she related to me that she was not
[8]having any pain or spasms, and Flexeril is a muscle
[9]relaxer.
[10]Q Okay.
[11]A You wouldn't take it -- Flexeril is not
[12]considered a safe medication to take over a prolonged
[13]period of time anyways.
[14]Q All right. And she gave you a history of
[15]having been in a car accident, correct?
[16]A Correct.
[17]Q And did you happen to see any of the
[18]photographs regarding that accident?
[19]A Yes, I did.
[20]Q All right. Did it make any impression upon
[21]you at all?
[22]A Actually, I couldn't see anything on the
[23]photographs.
[24]Q In terms of damage?
[25]A In terms of damage. They were color
[11]
[1]photographs. I didn't see any damage.
[2]Q All right.
[3]A They were of the rear of the vehicle.
[4]MS. LOPEZ: I'm going to make a motion to
[5]strike, beyond the scope.
[6]MR. SIERRA: Okay.
[7]BY MR. SIERRA:
[8]Q But you did, you did see the photographs at my
[9]request?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q All right And did the Plaintiff tell you
[12]whether she had to be transported from the scene? I
[13]believe it's at the bottom of the second paragraph.
[14]A Right. You'll have to excuse me because I
[15]don't remember all the details of this since it was two
[16]years ago, but I did make a report that states the
[17]following: "There were no medical personnel called to
[18]the scene of the motor vehicle accident. Police were
[19]there. She did not require transportation to any
[20]medical facility at that time."
[21]Q Right. And it appears that the first time
[22]that she -- or the first health care provider that she
[23]saw was Dr. Chang, her primary care physician?
[24]A Yes, I believe that is her primary care
[25]physician, because Dr. Chang had seen her before that as
[12]
[1]well.
[2]Q She also, after seeing Dr. Chang, had seen
[3]other doctors that you note on page 3 of your report.
[4]Dr. Fulton, Cummins, Dr. Hack (phonetic), Dr. Kuhn, and
[5]you've reviewed all of those records, correct?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q All right. When you saw her on this date,
[8]June 26, 2014, if you go through her present symptoms,
[9]what did she tell you at that time?
[10]A She was no longer having any neck pain and no
[11]radiating pain into the upper extremities. Her only
[12]complaint was some numbness and tingling of her right
[13]thumb, index and middle fingertips. She was not having
[14]any headaches, although she did have a positive history
[15]previously for migraines. She had no nausea or
[16]vomiting, no increased pain with coughing or sneezing
[17]and no ringing or buzzing in the ears and no blurred
[18]vision or double vision or dizziness.
[19]So in other words, she was asymptomatic.
[20]Q You then performed an orthopedic examination
[21]of the Plaintiff?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q All right. And that -- we're going to go
[24]through that. It basically starts and continues into
[25]page 4. Tell me basically what you do when you perform
[13]
[1]an orthopedic examination.
[2]A Okay. Well, first of all, in order to put it
[3]in an organized fashion -- this is not the exact order
[4]that I did everything, but it is for -- in order to
[5]record it, I did put it in a certain order.
[6]What I do, first of all, is do a general
[7]examination of the patient which I observe when the
[8]patient -- or when I first enter the room, I do examine
[9]the patient, how she comports herself, how she moves
[10]about, how she walks, her level of orientation, her
[11]demeanor. That's called the general examination,
[12]whether she's able to walk with a normal gait, whether
[13]she needs crutches or any other braces or assistive
[14]devices, that sort of thing.
[15]And then I go into the examination usually
[16]where the patient was symptomatic or was previously
[17]symptomatic. In this case she was not presently
[18]symptomatic but because of her history, I knew that she
[19]had previous neck problems and therefore I needed to do
[20]a neck examination.
[21]The neck examination doesn't only include the
[22]neck itself but it includes the extremities, primarily
[23]the, upper extremities, because it's the upper
[24]extremities that can be affected by neck injuries or
[25]neck diseases.
[14]
[1]So I do an examination of the neck itself, and
[2]I also do an examination of the neurology of the upper
[3]extremities which includes reflexes, sensory testing,
[4]muscle strength testing, looking for atrophy or thinning
[5]of the musculature. I check the cranial nerves, and
[6]what I'm trying do is find out any residuals that
[7]suggest any what we call radiculopathy or nerve root
[8]deficits.
[9]Q in this case you note that there was no
[10]palpable paraspinal muscle spasm. What is -- what is
[11]muscle spasm and why is that significant in terms of
[12]your findings here?
[13]A Muscle spasm is an involuntary contraction of
[14]a muscle, sometimes lasting only a few seconds but
[15]sometimes more prolonged but usually not over days or
[16]weeks or months. It's a rare finding. It's usually
[17]seen during the very acute phase of an injury, like
[18]right after an injury when the muscles react. It's sort
[19]of like a frightened attempt to get out of there, you
[20]know, because of the injury.
[21]So spasms can be palpable, can be actually
[22]visible. It's a rare finding after the first day after
[23]injuries, but it's involuntary. It's different than the
[24]patient simply contracting the muscle and holding it
[25]rigidly and avoiding motion. It's a different
[15]
[1]phenomenon all together.
[2]Q And in this case did you find any muscle
[3]spasm?
[4]A I did not.
[5]Q You also note that there was no tenderness to
[6]-- with percussion and deep palpation. What does that
[7]mean?
[8]A Percussion is simply tapping over different
[9]areas and palpation Is actually feeling the different
[10]areas. So I'm feeling the musculature, I'm feeling for
[11]deformities, I'm feeling for anything unusual that
[12]shouldn't be there. So palpation is another word for
[13]the actual examiner to feel the patient. That's called
[14]palpation.
[15]Q You also performed an active and passive range
[16]of motion test and -- testing. And what were the
[17]results of those tests?
[18]A The results -- by the way, range of motion is
[19]simply moving in six different directions, and her range
[20]of motion was recorded as being full values throughout.
[21]She had normal, range of motion.
[22]Q All right. You also did deep tendon reflex
[23]testing. What is -- what is the purpose of that type of
[24]testing?
[25]A That is when the hammer is placed over certain
[16]
[1]parts of tile arm to see if there's a reaction when you
[2]strike the soft tissue just directly over the bone. The
[3]reason we do reflex testing is because it can beefed
[4]of radiculopathy, once again, nerve root impingement or
[5]nerve root not functioning fully. And in those cases we
[6]may see a diminished reflex or less of a reaction. It's
[7]simply tapping with the rubber hammer,
[8]Q And in this case what were the results?
[9]A I recorded all as two plus, two plus being
[10]normal values on both the left and right side. It was a
[11]total of six different reflexes tested.
[12]Q You also did sensory testing and, again, found
[13]no deficits. What are you looking fur there?
[14]A Once again, in this case we're looking for
[15]either peripheral neuropathy or one of the nerves In the
[16]arms or hands being pinched or neck, pinching of a
[17]nerve, which we call, once again, radiculopathy. And
[18]I'm checking to see because a radiculopathy or
[19]peripheral neuropathy can result in an area of the skin,
[20]called a dermatome, that is not -- that the patient does
[21]not fed. And we do that to both touch and pinwheel.
[22]Q You also did motor strength testing again and
[23]found no evidence of weakness. Why do you do that and
[24]what does that signify?
[25]A For the same reason, to rule out any possible
[17]
[1]neuropathy or nerve injury or any possible
[2]radiculopathy, nerve root, another word for nerve root
[3]injury. When you have a nerve root injury, sometimes
[4]after a while you would see weakness in a certain muscle
[5]group corresponding to which nerve is being pinched.
[6]Q All right. You also found no apparent atrophy
[7]of the muscles of the upper extremities. Again, why do
[8]you do that?
[9]A For the same reason again, radiculopathy or
[10]peripheral neuropathy. In cases in which patients have
[11]had a prolonged pinching of a nerve or a nerve that's
[12]not functioning fully such as due to a neck problem,
[13]they would be expected to have signs that are measurable
[14]actually objectively, measurable, of atrophy or thinning
[15]of the musculature, because the muscles themselves that
[16]are innervated by that particular nerve root are not
[17]getting the impulses on a regular basis and therefore
[18]they tend to weaken and become thinner and we can often
[19]see that.
[20]Q In this case your entire orthopedic
[21]examination of the cervical spine of the upper
[22]extremities, your results were what, Doctor?
[23]A It was an entirely normal examination from a
[24]neurologic standpoint. The only positive finding was
[25]that she did have a scar over the front of her neck
[18]
[1]consistent with a surgical procedure.
[2]Q Okay. You also reviewed the -- some prior
[3]records, correct?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q And, Doctor, I'm looking at page 6 at the top.
[6]You indicate that the records that you reviewed
[7]indicated some preexisting symptoms around both
[8]shoulders and scapular areas. What is the significance
[9]of that in this case?
[10]A The most common cause for scapular pain, also
[11]known as upper trapezius pain or rhomboid pain, is due
[12]to a neck condition. That's what makes it so
[13]significant. A shoulder injury isolated to the shoulder
[14]joint usually does not result in any scapular pain
[15]unless there's an injury to the scapular thoracic joint
[16]itself. So what's the most common thing that I see in
[17]my office is upper trapezius and scapular pain, and it
[18]turns out to be due to degenerative arthritis of the
[19]neck. So I did note that each time.
[20]Q All right. And this --of course, this would
[21]have been findings that were prior to this car accident,
[22]correct?
[23]A Yeah. She had the scapular symptoms prior to
[24]this accident, and I believe Dr. Chang and Dr. Chang's
[25]PA recorded that.
[19]
[1]Q All right. Did they -- was there also any
[2]indication that she had had a cervical strain on the
[3]right in the past?
[4]A There was one notation that I came across in
[5]the past medical records of a cervical strain, a
[6]diagnosis of cervical strain.
[7]Q All right, Doctor. In addition to your review
[8]of the prior medical records, did you also have the
[9]opportunity to review the diagnostic studies, xrays and
[10]MRI films in this case?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q And these were of the cervical spine, correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q And what did you find in terms of the films
[15]that were done prior to this accident?
[16]A Well, I reviewed regular xrays of the cervical
[17]spine or the neck. The first set was May 18, 2011 --
[18]that was -- you're asking me prior, prior to this
[19]accident?
[20]Q Did you see anything there prior?
[21]A I don't -- no, I didn't -- I didn't have
[22]any --
[23]Q I guess what I -- what I meant to say is did
[24]you see anything on the May 18th films, which would have
[25]been done about six days after the accident, that --
[20]
[1]A Right.
[2]Q What were those findings?
[3]A "Prior" meaning --
[4]Q Prior meaning --
[5]A -- prior to the examination in my office?
[6]Q Yes.
[7]A Okay. Plain xrays dated May 18, 2011, as I
[8]said. They were done at Bert Fish Medical Center. They
[9]showed no evidence of posttraumatic condition such as a
[10]fracture or dislocation or anything like that.
[11]I did note between C5 and C6 preexisting
[12]degenerative arthritis that was there already. This
[13]caused or resulted in a narrowing of the foramen. Here
[14]being a model of the neck. Between 5 and 6, between
[15]here and here, there appeared to be degeneration which
[16]results in some narrowing of the disc space. And the
[17]foramen is this little hole in which this yellow thing
[18]comes through. This is the actual nerve root that comes
[19]through there so that's significant. There was
[20]narrowing of her foramen on her initial xrays resulting
[21]in a pinching -- an impingement upon that nerve root.
[22]That would result, of course, in pains into the shoulder
[23]area or scapular area as well.
[24]Q Now, this -- these xrays were taken six days
[25]after the accident. How long would it take findings
[21]
[1]like this to develop?
[2]A Probably years, but at least six months to a
[3]year. So we can be well assured that they were there
[4]prior to the accident. They don't occur in a short
[5]period of time. It takes part of the aging process.
[6]Q Okay. Did you find any other -- on the films
[7]any other findings that were of significance to you?
[8]A Also some osteophyte formation in addition to
[9]the degenerative changes of the disc itself. The
[10]curvature was unremarkable. There was also no air
[11]shadow displacement on this film. It is -- there was no
[12]bleeding that occurred in that area because that would
[13]have displaced the air shadows, which is -- the air
[14]shadows being the esophagus and trachea.
[15]Q What is a -- you note a right uncinate
[16]process. What is an uncinate process?
[17]A The margins of the vertebrae just above the
[18]foramen can form little tiny spurs. Some of them are
[19]physiologic, in other words, you're just born with. And
[20]those can contribute to the stenosis or narrowing of the
[21]space. So your uncinate process is going to be part of
[22]degenerative disease as well.
[23]Q And in lay terms we would commonly call them
[24]bone spurs?
[25]A Marginal spurs. A little different than the
[22]
[1]actual big spurs that are usually traction spurs from
[2]constantly pulling on the area. She had that as well.
[3]Q Now again, would those -- would those
[4]findings, would they be something that would occur over
[5]a period of time or would that be an acute finding?
[6]A No, that's a chronic finding again that
[7]preexisted this accident and was not caused by this
[8]accident. That was something in xray finding.
[9]Q In terms of the MRIs, were there any
[10]significant findings in your review of those films?
[11]A Once again, I saw what I described as a
[12]diffuse bulging of the disc between the fifth and the
[13]sixth cervical with foraminal narrowing at the level of
[14]the uncinate process on the right side, which you could
[15]see really well on the actual image, which is the cross
[16]sectional image of the -- of the MRI. So the MRI
[17]basically is a test more for the soft tissues rather
[18]than the bone itself, so that's why we do it, in
[19]addition to regular xrays of the neck.
[20]Q Doctor, I wanted to go to the last page which
[21]contains your opinions and first of all ask you in terms
[22]of the treatment that she received. Now, she -- she did
[23]undergo surgery on her neck following this accident as
[24]well as quite a long period of pain management by
[25]various doctors. In your opinion, Doctor, did any of
[23]
[1]that treatment have anything to do with this car
[2]accident?
[3]A Other than the initial few weeks, I don't --
[4]I don't relate it to the car accident. I don't believe
[5]the accident was the main problem. She was being
[6]treated primarily for, at least in part, due to
[7]degenerative disease or an aging disease or preexisting
[8]disease, whatever you want to call it. No more than if
[9]you went to a plastic surgeon and wanted your wrinkles
[10]taken out with a facelift would that be due to the
[11]accident because you noticed the wrinkles after the
[12]accident. Of course not.
[13]So for me as an orthopedic surgeon, it's --
[14]once again, it's not a -- degenerative disc disease is
[15]not actual disease. It's just part of the aging process
[16]that one goes through. We're all going to get it sooner
[17]or later.
[18]Q So in terms of reasonable medical
[19]probabilities, do you have an opinion as to whether --
[20]the long-term pain management that she had and the
[21]surgery, do you have an opinion as to whether that
[22]treatment was causally related to this accident?
[23]A Yes.
[24]Q And what is your opinion?
[25]A I do not feel it was causally related. Once
[24]
[1]again, the majority of her treatment was most likely
[2]necessitated by her preexisting condition and had really
[3]little relationship physically to the -- to the motor
[4]vehicle accident.
[5]Q In terms of -- now, you saw her years after
[6]the accident occurred and you're also evaluating her
[7]current condition as well, and when you -- how was she
[8]doing when you saw her?
[9]A Excellent. She was doing fantastic. Wouldn't
[10]want anything better than that. She did have -- turns
[11]out it wasn't an anterior cervical fusion. Xrays
[12]revealed it was a disc replacement surgery done by
[13]Dr. Kuhn. The disc replacement showed on the xrays that
[14]I saw excellent placement of the disc replacement. The
[15]surgery appeared to have been a full success.
[16]Q And did she tell you that, that she was --
[17]that she was happy with the procedure?
[18]A Oh, I could tell she was happy with the
[19]procedure because she was asymptomatic. Why wouldn't
[20]she be?
[21]Q And when you say asymptomatic, she had no
[22]pain, spasm anything?
[23]A Nothing relating to the neck. I wasn't sure
[24]why she was here. I do remember her even though this
[25]was two years ago because it's very rare that somebody
[25]
[1]comes in and I get to evaluate them totally
[2]asymptomatic. Doesn't happen often.
[3]Q Usually people come In they're complaining,
[4]correct?
[5]A Sometimes too many complaints.
[6]Q All right. With regard to her activities, did
[7]she tell you whether she had been able to resume her
[8]prior activities that she was doing before?
[9]A Yes, because she didn't have any -- any
[10]problems anymore. She was back to normal according to
[11]her.
[12]Q And would you place any restrictions on her
[13]based on what you saw?
[14]A Based on the motor vehicle accident, no, but I
[15]would place restrictions on a joint -- disc replacement.
[16]I don't think she should become a diver into a swimming
[17]pool off of a board. I wouldn't risk doing something
[18]like that.
[19]Q But based on the activities that she told you
[20]that she commonly did, you have no problem with her
[21]doing those things?
[22]A Not at all.
[23]Q All right. And did -- Doctor, do you have an
[24]opinion as to whether she sustained a permanent injury
[25]as a result of this car accident?
[26]
[1]A I have an opinion.
[2]Q And what is your opinion?
[3]A She had no permanent injury as a result of
[4]this accident.
[5]Q Let me see if there's anything else.
[6]Doctor, have all of the opinions that you
[7]have rendered today, have they been based on reasonable
[8]medical probability?
[9]A Yes.
[10]MR. SIERRA: Doctor, that's all I have. Thank
[11]you.
[12]CROSS-EXAMINATION
[13]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[14]Q Good afternoon, Doctor. Lina Lopez on behalf
[15]of the Plaintiff, Ms. Hines.
[16]Going to go back a little bit and go over some
[17]of your testimony. If I understood you correctly, you
[18]are stating that the prior scapular pain that she had in
[19]both her right shoulder and left shoulder in 2005 and in
[20]2009 are indicative that she was having neck pain?
[21]A Most likely no, not neck pain. I didn't say
[22]neck pain. What I said was radiculopathy from the neck.
[23]Q Okay.
[24]A Okay?
[25]Q Did you have the opportunity to review the
  27
[1]MRIs that were performed of her right shoulder on
[2]5/19/2009?
[3]A No.
[4]Q Okay. So as we sit here today, you have no
[5]idea what her right shoulder looked like on May of 2009,
[6]correct?
[7]A I can just base it, of course, on the medical
[8]reports and the doctors who described it. I believe it
[9]was Dr. McLeod described a SLAP lesion, a labral tear.
[10]Q Okay. And what are -- what causes a labrum
[11]tear?
[12]A There's -- labral tears can be physiologic or
[13]degenerative in nature. They can be false positives on
[14]an MRI because of the Buford complex right there at the
[15]bicipital tendon or they can be traumatic, secondary to
[16]a sudden injury to the shoulder in which the shoulder
[17]subluxates or dislocates.
[18]Q And do you know the cause of Ms. Hines' labrum
[19]tear in 2009?
[20]A No. I can just say that the pains in the
[21]scapular area would not be consistent with -- usually
[22]with a labral tear. Labral tears hurt directly in the
[23]shoulder area and are unstable. So she might have had
[24]two different things going on, I don't know. Of course,
[25]I didn't examine her back then.
  28
[1]Q Okay. So it also shows that she was diagnosed
[2]with tendinitis. What are some of the symptoms of
[3]tendinitis back in 2009?
[4]A You're asking me to testify to the symptoms
[5]that she had?
[6]Q No, I'm asking you -- you're an orthopedic
[7]physician, correct?
[8]A In general?
[9]Q Yeah, you treat people who suffer --
[10]A You said her symptoms.
[11]Q Who suffer from tendinitis.
[12]A Right. Oh, that's easy to answer, yes. I see
[13]it all the time. Tendinitis or tendinosis simply means
[14]an inflammatory condition of -- usually what we're
[15]talking about in the shoulder is the supraspinatus
[16]tendon which starts off as the greater tuberosity of the
[17]humeral head.
[18]The tendinitis usually results in painful
[19]range of motion. It hurts to move your shoulder. It
[20]can hurt at night. It can hurt constantly. It can hurt
[21]intermittently. Usually you don't see it because it's
[22]deep. You don't see swelling, you don't see redness you
[23]don't see any of that. So what we do usually is when
[24]patients are having shoulder pain and any motion of the
[25]shoulder causes pain and they don't respond to, say,
  29
[1]injections or antiinflammatory medications, well
[2]proceed with an MRI.
[3]That's where we get into problems because the
[4]MRIs on a certain age group will always show some
[5]findings positive. It's rare to have a perfectly normal
[6]MRI because MRIs are so sensitive.
[7]Q Okay. And did you see the records of
[8]Dr. Rhodes from Atlantic Orthopedics in 2009?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Okay. And as of August 12, 2009, how was
[11]Ms. Hines doing as it relates to her right shoulder?
[12]A She was seen I have on May 19, 2009, by
[13]Dr. Rhodes. She had recurrent pain now in her right
[14]shoulder. The MRI -- he diagnoses tendinosis and a
[15]possible torn labrum and the patient was sent for
[16]physical therapy and then discharged.
[17]Q Since you don't have the record in front of
[18]you, let me show you --
[19]A I can pull it up in a second. I have it all
[20]indexed.
[21]Q I could give it to you right here.
[22]A Okay. That works too.
[23]Q (Tendering.) All right. And for the purpose
[24]of the jury, that's her medical record from August 12,
[25]2009, where Ms. Hines treated at Atlantic Orthopedic.
  30
[1]And what was she -- how was she doing on that visit
[2]regarding her right shoulder with Dr. Richard Rhodes?
[3]A Her right shoulder he indicates being much
[4]better. Objectively what his findings were was that she
[5]had excellent range of motion and he describes in which
[6]direction, which is all directions. Neurovascular
[7]status was intact to her fingers. He says he -- she had
[8]just finished her physical therapy. He discharged her,
[9]as I said before. He recommended some swimming
[10]exercises, return to activity as tolerated and return as
[11]needed.
[12]Q Okay. So as it relates to her right shoulder,
[13]it appears she had made a full recovery of her
[14]tendinitis?
[15]A Well, I can't tell -- I can't testify to what
[16]she had during this day. You'd have to ask.
[17]Q According to that medical record.
[18]A According to the medical records, which is one
[19]paragraph, I can't say whether she made a full recovery
[20]or not. That would be inappropriate for me to
[21]speculate --
[22]Q But you're --
[23]A -- to such a big conclusion.
[24]Q But you're doing it with all the other medical
[25]records?
[31]
[1]A No, not at all.
[2]Q Okay. All right. Now, let me show you a
[3]couple more -- you said you reviewed Dr. Chang's prior
[4]medical records; is that correct?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q All right.
[7]A Prior to the motor vehicle accident?
[8]Q Yes, sir, of 2011.
[9]A And after.
[10]Q Yes.
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q But right now we're talking about prior to the
[13]accident of May 24th, 2011. Did you have the
[14]opportunity to review the visits prior to this accident
[15]within two years of this accident?
[16]A Within two years, I can just tell you that I
[17]saw records from Dr. Chang dating back to August 18th,
[18]1999, all the way to August 29, 2005. Is that what
[19]you're referring to?
[20]Q No. I'm -- I'm looking at -- I'm going to
[21]show you what is reported as a well woman exam dated
[22]9/10/2010. It looks like it was signed by Dr. Chang.
[23]A I'm not sure I had that.
[24]Q Do you have -- does it appear that Ms. Hines
[25]is complaining of any neck pain?
[32]
[1]A She writes down "physical examination normal."
[2]She doesn't really talk about -- I don't see where it's
[3]talking about symptomatology.
[4]Q Okay.
[5]A Okay?
[6]Q So --
[7]A So may I --
[8]Q That's my question. That's the end of my
[9]question, Doctor. Thank you.
[10]A May I answer? You don't want me to answer the
[11]question?
[12]MR. SIERRA: He's permitted to explain his
[13]answer.
[14]MS. LOPEZ: I was going to say motion to
[15]strike, unresponsive.
[16]MR. SIERRA: You can still answer it, Doctor.
[17]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[18]Q There's no judge here so you can go ahead and
[19]answer.
[20]A Of course. No, the absence of a -- absence of
[21]a symptom or the absence of a physical finding does not
[22]indicate that it was not there. It's just that it
[23]wasn't done. She may not have even evaluated her neck
[24]or asked her that question. So it's not the absence of
[25]a finding, it's the presence of a finding that's
  33
[1]important to a physician.
[2]Q And if I understood you correctly also, in
[3]your prior medical records you don't have any of these
[4]well woman exams that show that a full physical was done
[5]on Ms. Hines prior to the accident?
[6]A The one you just showed me I can just tell you
[7]I do not have a record of receiving or reviewing. Like
[8]I said before, they go up to 2005 and then there were
[9]some additional ones after the accident as well when I
[10]believe the patient saw again Margaret Chang after the
[11]accident. I have those.
[12]Q Okay. And you mentioned prior problems with
[13]her neck that you reported in Dr. Chang's records; is
[14]that correct?
[15]A That's correct.
[16]Q All right. And how many -- on how many
[17]occasions did you note that?
[18]A I only noted the word "cervical strain" on one
[19]medical record. I -- as I said before, I noticed more
[20]than once scapular pain, upper trapezius pain and
[21]symptoms which I attribute to the neck because that's
[22]what it usually is caused by.
[23]Q Okay. And you were referring to the note of
[24]May 23, 2008; is that correct?
[25]A Yes, that was the primary one. It was
[34]
[1]actually a note I believe by the PA, Shelly Fradet, I
[2]believe is a PA there in which that is where it's
[3]mentioned "right cervical strain." It's also mentioned
[4]about the right scapula for the past two weeks, and
[5]maybe this PA also was thinking neck as well because
[6]where else would she get the diagnosis right cervical
[7]strain if she wasn't thinking that the scapular pain was
[8]coming from the neck?
[9]And, actually, the patient was placed on
[10]Flexeril, ten milligrams, at that time which would be a
[11]muscle relaxant usually done for the neck.
[12]MS. LOPEZ: Motion to strike, unresponsive.
[13]Q Was there physical examination done on May
[14]23rd, 2008?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Okay. Any abnormal findings regarding her
[17]neck?
[18]A Pain in the right trapezius muscle with
[19]flexion. Right trapezius muscle was tender to palpation
[20]and there was mild muscle spasm. This is all neck.
[21]This is neck.
[22]Q Okay. For the purpose of the jury, can you
[23]Identify the anatomy of the cervical spine?
[24]A Sure. Here's the anatomy of the cervical
[25]spine (indicating).
  35
[1]Q Okay. And in that particular model that you
[2]just showed to the jury, is there -- is the trapezius
[3]muscle part of that anatomy?
[4]A No, it's indirectly due to the nerve root.
[5]Q Okay.
[6]A May I continue with that --
[7]Q I'll ask my followup.
[8]A You don't want the jury to know that?
[9]Q Well, I was going to ask my followup.
[10]A Okay, why don't you ask your followup and I
[11]can go ahead and complete my answer about the anatomy...
[12]MR. SIERRA: Let me just put on the record
[13]that you've got to let him finish his answer. Even
[14]if you don't like it --
[15]MS. LOPEZ: Well, he's got to --
[16]MR. SIERRA: -- you've got to let him finish.
[17]You know --
[18]MS. LOPEZ: He's got to stick to what the
[19]question I'm asking and not go on and volunteer
[20]information.
[21]MR. SIERRA: He was trying to answer your
[22]question.
[23]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[24]Q All right. So just to go back on what we were
[25]discussing, the trapezius muscle is not part of the
  36
[1]actual cervical spine, correct?
[2]A It attaches to the cervical spine. It's not
[3]part of the bony elements.
[4]Q Okay.
[5]A It's part of the musculature that attaches to
[6]the thoracic and cervical area.
[7]Q Okay.
[8]A So, yes, the trapezius is part of the neck.
[9]Q Now, is it -- when you say it is part of the
[10]neck, are you referring to the dermatome patterns?
[11]A No, I am not. But it's not a dermatome. It's
[12]a little different than a dermatome. Dermatomes are in
[13]the arms and the upper extremities.
[14]Q Okay.
[15]A But there is a pathway, which I have a diagram
[16]of, of where the trapezius is, which is right here.
[17]This is C5 radiculopathy, and you see that it's the
[18]trapezius here is right here and here on a C6
[19]radiculopathy.
[20]This is something that I just saw a few
[21]minutes ago before coming in today that I found on the
[22]Internet that explains where your pain distribution is
[23]when you have a radiculopathy or a pinched nerve.
[24]MS. LOPEZ: I'm going to do a motion to strike
[25]that exhibit as it wasn't previously provided to
  37
[1]me, number one. Two, the doctor just said he found
[2]it a few minutes ago so it's beyond the four
[3]corners of his report.
[4]MR. SIERRA: Well, it's a demonstrative
[5]exhibit that's based on anatomy that's covered
[6]exhaustively in his report.
[7]MS. LOPEZ: I'm just --
[8]MR. SIERRA: I'm just responding for the
[9]record.
[10]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[11]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[12]Q All right. All right. So moving forward.
[13]Other than that 5/23/2008 visit and your mention of the
[14]right trapezius pain complaints which, in your opinion,
[15]are related to the cervical spine, was there any other
[16]finding specific to the neck between 1997 and 2011 when
[17]this accident occurred in May?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Where?
[20]A Okay. When looking back at Dr. Chang's
[21]records, I also had August 12, 2000, which the patient
[22]indicated breaking up a fight, got hit in the neck, head
[23]and shoulders.
[24]Again, September 28, 2000, patient complained
[25]of left-sided migraine and numbness on the left side.
  38
[1]And again on August 22, 2005, she had a fall
[2]in which she complained of right arm pain and shoulder
[3]pain which could have been a neck injury at that time.
[4]On 8/29/05 she also complained of right
[5]shoulder pain again.
[6]On March 22nd, 2002, with Dr. McLeod, that's
[7]when the left shoulder was causing pain. He injected
[8]It.
[9]On September 26, 2005, is when she had
[10]arthroscopic surgery to her right shoulder for right
[11]shoulder pain.
[12]So what I'm saying is I wonder -- I don't know
[13]within a reasonable degree of medical probability
[14]whether that was due to her neck at that time because I
[15]didn't examine her at that time. But it would -- to
[16]answer your question, yeah, this might have been.
[17]Q Okay. So is it your testimony, if I
[18]understood you correctly, within a reasonable degree of
[19]medical probability, that all these times that you just
[20]mentioned were indicative of Ms. Hines having a -- some
[21]type of cervical condition that was contributing to
[22]having all these symptoms?
[23]A It might have been within -- but within a
[24]reasonable degree of probability, I am not able to state
[25]that. That wouldn't be fair because I didn't see her or
  39
[1]examine her. All I can say is that to answer your
[2]question, to answer the question accurately, yes, there
[3]may have been other incidents of symptomatology, but I
[4]cannot testify within a reasonable degree of medical
[5]probability that it was coming from the neck.
[6]Q Okay. And let's talk -- since you took a time
[7]to mention all these other occasions, on 3/12/2000 when
[8]she broke up a fight at school, was there any treatment
[9]for neck injury?
[10]A Specifically Dr. Chang, whether she documented
[11]any treatment? That's a question for Dr. Chang. All I
[12]can say is the records did not indicate specific
[13]treatment to the neck.
[14]Q Okay. Was there any complaint of neck pain on
[15]3/12/2000?
[16]A Other than the fact -- no, other than the fact
[17]that the patient stated she injured -- suffered injuries
[18]to the neck area when the patient broke up the fight.
[19]Q Did she say she suffered injuries to the neck
[20]or that she got hit in the neck?
[21]A I'm not sure I understand the distinction
[22]between injury and being hit. I would consider being
[23]hit an injury.
[24]Q Okay.
[25]A Another word for it.
  40
[1]Q And 9/28/2000 you said she was complaining of
[2]migraines, correct?
[3]A Correct.
[4]Q Okay. And migraines are -- do you know what
[5]history she has of migraines?
[6]A I'm not testifying to migraines.
[7]Q I'm just asking you.
[8]A I can only state what she said.
[9]Q Okay.
[10]A No, I'm not an expert in migraines. I'm not a
[11]neurologist. I'm an orthopedic surgeon. I'm going to
[12]keep my testimony to my expertise.
[13]Q But my question was, do you know what history
[14]she has of migraines?
[15]A No, did not delve into it other than the fact
[16]that there was mention that she had migraines and that's
[17]all.
[18]Q Do you know if she had previously treated with
[19]a neurologist for migraines?
[20]A I believe that's true, Dr. Martinez.
[21]Q Okay. And so when you stated that she was
[22]complaining of -- when I inquired as to whether any
[23]prior visits that you noted were indicative of neck
[24]pain, you mentioned this migraine, so that's why I'm
[25]inquiring to you. Was there any specific indication on
[41]
[1]this particular visit that she was suffering from any
[2]neck pain?
[3]A Once again, I cannot testify to whether she --
[4]the actual level of neck pain, if she had neck symptoms
[5]because migraines sometimes can be caused by neck
[6]problems. It's a very common cause for -- for
[7]headaches. I am trained and expert in occipital
[8]headaches, that sort of thing, when they're due to a
[9]neck condition, but I only mention that because you
[10]asked me that question, was there other possibilities or
[11]things that occurred --
[12]Q No, I asked you specifically --
[13]A I'm sorry --
[14]MR. SIERRA: Let him finish before you
[15]interrupt him.
[16]A I thought -- I was under the impression that
[17]you had asked me to list other times where there could
[18]have been a neck problem. What I also said was the lack
[19]of documentation of a physical examination of a
[20]particular area, that would have to come -- the details
[21]of that examination other than the reports would have to
[22]come from those doctors. You'd have to ask them to
[23]testify.
[24]Q Okay. So just to clarify, when I inquired
[25]earlier as to whether you -- other than the May 23rd,
[42]
[1]2008 visit, whether there was any prior treatment to the
[2]cervical spine or conditions of the cervical spine that
[3]you noted in the prior medical records -- and you listed
[4]about ten days of -- in the medical records other than
[5]the May 23rd, 2008 visit, there was no other treatment
[6]to her cervical spine, correct?
[7]A No. You didn't ask if she had any treatment.
[8]You asked if she had any conditions to her neck,
[9]anything at all. You didn't use the word "treatment"
[10]when you asked that question. I could have answered
[11]that question. I do not know of any documented
[12]treatment. And I think I did answer that question after
[13]you asked it more precisely. But when I listed those
[14]other things, it was just mentioning possible neck
[15]conditions.
[16]Q Okay. Just give me one second here.
[17]Now, did you review Dr. Fulton's records? I
[18]mean, not Dr. -- Dr. Kuhn, I'm sorry.
[19]A Yes,
[20]Q All right. Earlier we talked about some
[21]MRI -- xrays and MRIs that you reviewed. The xrays and
[22]MRIs that you reviewed of the cervical spine were in
[23]2011, correct?
[24]A I believe so, yes.
[25]Q Okay.
  43
[1]A After the accident.
[2]Q 5/24/2011?
[3]A I can give you the exact date in a moment. I
[4]did see some xrays in the year 2013, as well as the --
[5]as well as the plain xrays that were in 2011 and the MRI
[6]which was also around that time, I believe.
[7]Q The MRI was what year, sir?
[8]A I didn't record the year, though. That was
[9]in -- I'll have to look that up.
[10]The MRI of the cervical spine was May 24,
[11]2011,
[12]Q Okay. Did you review any other diagnostic
[13]testing following that MRI of 2011?
[14]A The actual tests themselves --
[15]Q No, any --
[16]A -- or the reports?
[17]Q Any other reports or any additional films?
[18]A Well, yes, the previous medical records I have
[19]already listed in the reports.
[20]Q No, my question was, have you reviewed --
[21]other than the MRI of the cervical spine that was
[22]performed on May 24, 2011, did you review any additional
[23]MRIs that were performed after May 24, 2011?
[24]A No.
[25]Q Do you know if she had some?
  44
[1]A I don't recall offhand. I think she might
[2]have had another MRI. I'm not sure.
[3]Q Would it have been included in your report?
[4]A Yes, if I had it, I would have reviewed it.
[5]Q Do you have any notation in your report that
[6]you either reviewed a report or an actual film of an MRI
[7]performed in July of 2013?
[8]MR. SIERRA: It's page 6, Doc.
[9]THE WITNESS: Page 6? Thank you.
[10]A The second MRI was on June 27th, 2013, by
[11]report done at Port Orange Imaging Center. The report
[12]indicated "no significant protrusion or bulge and only a
[13]diffuse disc bulge at C5-C6 with some mild right
[14]foraminal narrowing," which seems to be quite consistent
[15]with the MRI that I reviewed.
[16]Q And just for the record, you only reviewed the
[17]report, correct?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q All right.
[20]A Correct.
[21]Q Now, earlier when we were discussing the MRI
[22]performed an May 24, 2011, you mentioned -- I'm sorry,
[23]the xray. You mentioned that the xray showed some
[24]narrow -- narrowing of the foramena?
[25]A Foramen.
[45]
[1]Q Foramen, is that correct?
[2]A That's correct, foramen, on the right side.
[3]Q Okay. Is -- is narrowing something that could
[4]be caused by trauma?
[5]A If it was many years previous. Trauma can
[6]lead eventually over the years to that problem. So
[7]let's say ten years ago prior to this motor vehicle
[8]accident she suffered an injury to her neck, it could
[9]have resulted in accelerated degenerative disc disease
[10]and arthritis with foraminal encroachment.
[11]Q Okay. And let me ask you this question. Do
[12]you know if she's had any followup treatment for her
[13]right shoulder since she's seen you?
[14]A I have no additional records after she saw me.
[15]I have not reviewed any additional records.
[16]Q Is the fact that she's still having ongoing
[17]right problems, right shoulder problems, scapula pain,
[18]treating with an orthopedic surgeon for that, is that
[19]indicative that her problem is related to her right
[20]shoulder or is it still related to her neck?
[21]A Same -- if she had scapular pain, it's not --
[22]most likely not due to her shoulder. Once again, it's
[23]most likely due to her neck if she is having those
[24]symptoms. I'm assuming what you're telling me is true.
[25]Q All right. And regarding her complaint as far
  46
[1]as the medical -- prior medical records that you
[2]reviewed, the last time she had any specific what you
[3]considered to be symptoms that might be indicative of
[4]neck problems would have been in 2009 to the trapezius
[5]muscle?
[6]A Other than what you just told me a minute ago,
[7]that she had scapular pain?
[8]Q I'm talking about 2014, 2015, which I'm asking
[9]you --
[10]A I don't have those records.
[11]Q I know, but my question was, other -- before
[12]this accident, May 24, 2011 -- I'm sorry, May 12, 2011,
[13]did you note the last time you saw any symptoms that
[14]were indicative to you of any neck problems?
[15]A I did not note that, no.
[16]Q Okay. When was the last time she received any
[17]treatment for her shoulders?
[18]A Well, I don't know. You're asking me somebody
[19]else's records.
[20]Q You reviewed them, correct?
[21]A I don't have them committed to memory. Of
[22]course I reviewed them. I didn't memorize them though.
[23]If you can point to something to me, I'd be happy to
[24]look at it.
[25]Q Okay. All right. Now, regarding her
  47
[1]examination, how long did the exam take?
[2]A I have no recollection how long it took. Nor
[3]did I record that.
[4]Q Okay. And I think earlier you already alluded
[5]to this, that you have any -- do you have any
[6]independent recollection of Ms. Hines?
[7]A Vague. Because, as I said before, I do
[8]recollect her because she was asymptomatic and I
[9]remember her telling me that.
[10]Q And just for the purpose of the jury, can you
[11]explain what you mean by "asymptomatic"?
[12]A No complaints.
[13]Q Okay.
[14]A All better, resolved.
[15]Q Okay. Now, did you see any MRIs of the
[16]cervical spine prior to May 24th, 2011?
[17]A No.
[18]Q -- 12, 2011. I'm sorry. And you mentioned --
[19]let's just go back a second here. What was your
[20]bachelors degree in?
[21]A Chemistry.
[22]Q Okay. And other than the medical school, did
[23]you have any additional fellowships or anything along
[24]those lines?
[25]A No, as I said, I entered private practice in
  48
[1]July. Back in 1978 there wasn't much in the way of
[2]fellowships.
[3]Q Okay. All right. And --
[4]A Back in those days we were fully trained in
[5]everything.
[6]Q Okay. Now, you also mentioned the fact that
[7]she was taking Flexeril on the morning of the visit; is
[8]that correct?
[9]A That's correct.
[10]Q Did you inquire as to why she was taking
[11]Flexeril?
[12]A I don't recall if I inquired or not. I know
[13]that she -- whether I asked her why or not. I don't
[14]recall that. I didn't record that. Any reason -- I
[15]didn't -- I would have given the reason if I had asked
[16]her probably.
[17]Q So the fact that she was taking Flexeril, we
[18]don't know if it was indicative she was suffering from
[19]any other ailments that you were not aware of, correct?
[20]A Well, I asked her and her intake form and
[21]everywhere else, there was no -- nothing to indicate a
[22]reason for taking Flexeril other than the fact -- which
[23]worries me, of course, because Flexeril is a controlled
[24]substance now. It is not a safe drug to take
[25]chronically.
  49
[1]Q Okay. Now, you also mentioned that you do the
[2]compulsory medical exams, correct?
[3]A I do them, yes, of course. Did this one too.
[4]Q And you mentioned in your direct examination
[5]that you are winding down?
[6]A No, not compulsory medical evaluations per se.
[7]I'm winding down, I'm slowing down my practice now
[8]that -- I stopped doing the spinal surgery as of January
[9]1st. I was doing the spine surgery for the last 40
[10]years, so now I'm slowing down. I'm getting to the age
[11]where I'm going to try to enjoy my family a little bit
[12]more.
[13]Q Okay. Now, I know you mentioned that you had
[14]not been retained prior to this case by Mr. Sierra; is
[15]that correct?
[16]MR. SIERRA: That -- that's not what he said.
[17]A It's okay.
[18]MR. SIERRA: Testified at trial.
[19]MS. LOPEZ: I'm sorry. I apologize.
[20]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[21]Q But have you been retained by Mr. Sierra in
[22]the past?
[23]A Probably. I don't recall any, but I've seen
[24]his name before, if that's what you're asking. I don't
[25]remember even a deposition, actually. I don't know
  50
[1]whether he has -- he has referred patients. I'm sure
[2]they've referred other patients for compulsory medical
[3]examination because he is a rather large firm. But I
[4]don't make any attempt at documenting or keeping track
[5]of that sort of thing because it has no influence on my
[6]testimony.
[7]Q Do you have any breakdown of how much has been
[8]paid by representatives of the Defendant to you in the
[9]last three years?
[10]A I don't even know who the representative of
[11]the Defendant has been. Nor do I keep track of any of
[12]that information. Has no bearing on my testimony or
[13]my -- my examination.
[14]Q Okay. If I were to tell you in the last three
[15]years you've been paid $ 351,000 by the Defendant's
[16]representatives, would you -- does that sound right to
[17]you?
[18]A I have no opinion. I don't know the number
[19]and I don't even know who it is so how could I possibly
[20]answer if it sounded right or not?
[21]Q Okay. And let's go over your charges for this
[22]case.
[23]MR. SIERRA: Just let me put on the record
[24]that you're telling him that it's Defendant's
[25]representatives I think is inaccurate and
[51]
[1]misleading, but for the record.
[2]MS. LOPEZ: There's case law on that though.
[3]MR. SIERRA: I understand.
[4]MS. LOPEZ: Because I can't say anything else.
[5]MR. SIERRA: I understand, but I still think
[6]it's misleading the way it's phrased.
[7]MS. LOPEZ: Okay.
[8]BY MS. LOPEZ:
[9]Q Let me rephrase just in case that gets
[10]stricken.
[11]Do you have any indication or recollection how
[12]much Mr. Sierra or his lawfirm have paid you in the last
[13]three years?
[14]A None at all. It would be a total guess. I
[15]have no idea because it has no importance to me.
[16]Q All right. If I were to tell you that you've
[17]been paid in the last three years -- this doesn't
[18]include 2016 -- $ 351,656.66. Does that number surprise
[19]you?
[20]MR. SIERRA: Again, objection. That's not a
[21]figure from our lawfirm so -- it's impossible,
[22]so -- go ahead.
[23]A Once again, I have no reason to take that as
[24]being true or not since I have no knowledge of it
[25]whatsoever. I can't answer something I don't know the
[52]
[1]answer to.
[2]Q Okay. What if I were to tell you that we sent
[3]expert discovery to the defense attorney and he provided
[4]such numbers for me on your behalf?
[5]A Is that a question you're asking him or me?
[6]Q No, I'm asking you.
[7]A I would have no knowledge of that, once again.
[8]Q Okay.
[9]A This is not something I can even attempt to
[10]answer so I have no knowledge of it.
[11]Q Okay. Now, regarding this particular case
[12]involving Ms. Hines, when were you retained?
[13]A It looks like it was in March, on March 11,
[14]2014, they called the office to schedule the
[15]appointment.
[16]Q Okay. And as of the time that you performed
[17]the examination of Ms. Hines, how much total time had
[18]you charged up to date, until that day?
[19]A I don't believe there was any charges prior to
[20]the evaluation.
[21]Q Okay. Did you review records prior to the
[22]evaluation or after?
[23]A No. It would have been a summary. I review
[24]medical records usually the day of the examination.
[25]Q Okay. All right. How much total did you
  53
[1]charge for the evaluation?
[2]A Let me pull that statement out, if I may.
[3]There was a reserved time fee for the compulsory medical
[4]evaluation that was charged for May 22nd, 2014. The
[5]patient arrived with a videographer and it was not
[6]prescheduled. We did not have time to do the
[7]examination without pre-knowledge of it being
[8]videotaped. That was $ 950.
[9]It was then rescheduled to come back on June
[10]26, 2014, and this time it was scheduled with the
[11]videographer but the videographer didn't come. The
[12]patient elected to proceed with the evaluation without
[13]the videographer, but the time that was given for that
[14]exam included the videographer and that was $ 1,700.
[15]There was a deposition that you requested, I
[16]remember, and that was $ 775. Somebody requested medical
[17]records or copies of the medical records which was an
[18]additional $ 138.75.
[19]On March 28th I did a review of the records
[20]prior to it -- I think this was your question -- prior
[21]to the actual first IME because -- or sorry, compulsory
[22]medical examination, which was $ 325, and a telephone
[23]conference on that same day with somebody, I didn't
[24]record who, was $ 150.
[25]Q And in the time frame between the medical exam
  54
[1]that eventually took place I think June 26, 2014, and
[2]today, other than the deposition, previous deposition
[3]that I took of you, have you been charged any additional
[4]costs for this particular file?
[5]A There will be a charge for today's deposition.
[6]Q Okay. Any additional time for record review?
[7]A No.
[8]Q Okay. You met with --
[9]A There will be additional time for record
[10]review depending on after this deposition is completed.
[11]I have already spent four hours on the record for you.
[12]Q Okay. So how much do you charge for record
[13]view?
[14]A 350 per hour, I believe.
[15]Q Okay. So you already spent -- in prior --
[16]preparation for today's deposition, you spent four hours
[17]reviewing the medical records again?
[18]A Yes. I had to review them all over again
[19]because it was two years previous that I had reviewed
[20]them.
[21]Q Okay. I just want to make sure I have an
[22]accurate breakdown. And you met with opposing counsel
[23]before the video deposition. Are you going to be
[24]charging for that time?
[25]A Today?
  55
[1]Q Yes, sir.
[2]A No.
[3]Q Have you met with him any other time before
[4]today other than what we already talked about to discuss
[5]this file?
[6]A No.
[7]Q And I think you said you charge 950 an hour
[8]for your video deposition?
[9]A $ 975 an hour.
[10]Q Okay. Now, do you have an opinion as to
[11]whether Ms. Hines sustained any injuries -- I'm not
[12]asking whether they were permanent or not -- from the
[13]auto accident of May 12, 2011?
[14]A No.
[15]Q Okay. And you also mentioned that a few weeks
[16]of treatments -- I don't want to put words in your
[17]mouth -- I think you said was reasonable?
[18]A When did I say that? In the deposition? Did
[19]I say that today?
[20]Q Yes, sir.
[21]A Because it's true. I -- for me we're
[22]referring in general to a person who comes in with
[23]similar problems would it be reasonable to do about
[24]three weeks of treatment? Yes, it would be reasonable.
[25]Whether it turns out to the necessary or not, no, not
[56]
[1]necessarily needed, but it is reasonable to rule out any
[2]possible thing that does need to be treated.
[3]Q Okay. All right. So just so were clear,
[4]it's your testimony that none of the treatment Ms. Hines
[5]received was reasonable and related to this accident?
[6]A No, I didn't say that either.
[7]Q Okay. So what are you saying, Doctor?
[8]A I'm saying that the treatment at the very
[9]beginning might have been reasonable. Those were my
[10]words as well.
[11]Q Might have been?
[12]A Sure. I don't know because I wasn't there.
[13]Q Okay.
[14]A Is it reasonable looking back at the medical
[15]records for her to have an evaluation with her primary
[16]care physician, for instance? Yes. Sometimes patients
[17]continue to have complaints of pain in the neck. Is it
[18]reasonable to get an MRI? Possibly, but I don't know at
[19]that time because I didn't examine her.
[20]Q Okay. So as to the reasonableness of the MRI
[21]of the cervical spine that was recommended by Dr. Chang,
[22]would you defer to her since she saw her at that time?
[23]A No, I don't defer to any doctor, especially
[24]one that is not specialized in neck injuries.
[25]Q Okay. And so it's your opinion she had no
  57
[1]injuries from this accident. Possibly some treatment,
[2]minimal treatment would have been necessary?
[3]A I think you're summarizing something I didn't
[4]exactly say.
[5]MR. SIERRA: Object to the form.
[6]A I don't know if you're saying that for the
[7]record or just talking to yourself, but some of that you
[8]just said, it's not what I just Said, not exactly.
[9]Q Okay. Well, she had no injuries from this
[10]accident, correct?
[11]A I already answered that question. I said she
[12]may have had injuries -- because you qualified that to
[13]be permanent, whether it was permanent or not. I don't
[14]know whether she had any initial injuries or any
[15]exacerbation of her arthritis or anything like that
[16]because I wasn't there.
[17]Q Okay.
[18]A That's a different question.
[19]Q Well, no, my question was -- I wasn't talking
[20]about permanent injuries.
[21]A Yeah, that's what --
[22]Q Okay. It's your opinion that she had -- well,
[23]let me start again. Do you have an opinion whether she
[24]had any injuries of any kind following this auto
[25]accident that were not permanent, in your opinion?
  58
[1]A There is no way to answer that question
[2]because she could have had an exacerbation of her
[3]arthritis. This is about the fourth time I'm saying the
[4]same thing, I know, but that -- not that she did. It's
[5]just that I wasn't there so I couldn't answer that
[6]question specifically.
[7]Q Okay. And regarding the need for the surgery
[8]that Dr. Kuhn ultimately performed, do you have an
[9]opinion as to whether that surgery was related -- the
[10]need for that surgery was related to this auto accident
[11]of May 20117
[12]A I do have an opinion.
[13]Q And what is that, sir?
[14]A It was not related to the motor vehicle
[15]accident, as I stated previously. It was done, from
[16]what I can see, as primarily for her degenerative
[17]disease at C5-C6.
[18]Q Okay. What kind of physician is Dr. Kuhn?
[19]A Neurosurgeon.
[20]Q For the purpose of the jury, can you explain
[21]the difference between neurosurgeon and orthopedic
[22]surgeon?
[23]A A neurosurgeon is trained to treat brain and
[24]spine, whereas an orthopedic surgeon is trained to treat
[25]the spine and extremities. So Dr. Kuhn would not be
  59
[1]doing a knee replacement, but I would not take a tumor
[2]off of somebody's brain.
[3]Q Okay.
[4]A So one deals with the different parts of the
[5]body, but there's an overlap when it comes to spine. We
[6]invented anterior cervical fusion as orthopedic
[7]surgeons.
[8]MS. LOPEZ: All right, Doctor, that's all the
[9]questions I have. Tender the witness back to your
[10]attorney.
[11]THE WITNESS: Excuse me. He's not my
[12]attorney.
[13]MS. LOPEZ: I'm sorry.
[14]MR. SIERRA: Exactly.
[15]REDIRECT EXAMINATION
[16]BY MR. SIERRA:
[17]Q Doctor, I just wanted to clarify one thing, or
[18]a couple of things. When she was asking you about the
[19]July 27, 2013, MRI that's referred to on page 6 of your
[20]report, I believe that you said that you were -- you
[21]reviewed the report but didn't review the film, but I'm
[22]looking down at what you label as paragraph two near the
[23]bottom of that page and you indicate --
[24]A Which page?
[25]Q This is page 6 of your report.
  60
[1]A Okay.
[2]Q -- that you were able to retrieve that film
[3]online.
[4]A I was.
[5]Q Port Orange film?
[6]A Oh, I thought --
[7]Q See where I'm referring to?
[8]MS. LOPEZ: I'm going to object. Outside the
[9]scope of his report In his discovery deposition
[10]he testified clearly that he had not read it.
