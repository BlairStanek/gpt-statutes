[1]Q Okay. What do you -- your report has been
[2]marked as Farcht Exhibit Number 1 -- Farcht Exhibit
[3]Number 1.
[4]A Okay.
[5]Q Farcht Exhibit 1 which I need my copy of
[6]that. Here we go. Does this contain all your opinions
[7]related to this case?
[8]A Thus far.
[9]Q Okay. Do the -- does your opinion depend
[10]upon whether or not the McNultys own their land in fee
[11]simple?
[12]A Well, I appraise fee simple interest.
[13]Q Okay. What does fee simple mean?
[14]A It's the greatest bundle of rights private
[15]property owners can hold subject to the four great
[16]forces.
[17]Q Which are?
[18]A Police power. Taxation. Escheat and
[19]eminent domain.
[20]Q The land that you appraised, was it owned
[21]in fee simple?
[6]
[1]A That's what I appraised. I didn't do a
[2]title search.
[3]Q Do you know -- do you know whether it's
[4]owned in fee simple?
[5]A No. It's not part of my -- scope of my
[6]assignment was to appraise fee simple interest.
[7]Q Okay. So if you didn't appraise -- if the
[8]land in question is not owned in fee simple, that could
[9]affect the value, correct?
[10]A It depends.
[11]Q I said it could affect the value; is that
[12]correct?
[13]A Not necessarily, no.
[14]Q That's not an answer to my question,
[15]though, is it?
[16]A I said no.
[17]Q Huh?
[18]A I said no.
[19]Q No, it could not affect --
[20]A I said not necessarily, no. I'm trying to
[21]explain my no.
[7]
[1]Q That's a double no. Let me ask my
[2]questions, and you answer my questions. Okay. My
[3]question is if the land is not owned in fee simple,
[4]that could affect your opinion, correct?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[6]A There is not enough in your question for me
[7]to give you an affirmative or a negative answer. I
[8]don't know under your hypothetical.
[9]Q If -- if -- I said "could." If the land is
[10]not owned in fee simple, that could affect the value of
[11]the land, correct?
[12]A I don't know enough of your question to
[13]give you an informed answer.
[14]Q Okay. So you don't know whether owning
[15]something in fee simple or not in fee simple affects
[16]the value?
[17]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[18]A That wasn't the last question.
[19]Q Well, do you know the answer to that?
[20]A It depends upon what property rights you
[21]are comparing to fee simple.
[8]
[1]Q Okay. Well, you valued fee simple?
[2]A I did.
[3]Q Okay. If -- if this land in this case is
[4]not owned in fee simple, will that affect the value
[5]that you placed on it?
[6]A It depends on what ownership you assert in
[7]comparison to the fee simple rights.
[8]Q Okay. How about a right-of-way?
[9]A I don't understand your question.
[10]Q Would a right-of-way on the land that you
[11]valued affect the value of the land?
[12]A It depends upon the appraisal problem upon
[13]which the right-of-way is being considered.
[14]Q So everything depends?
[15]A Well, I think most opinions are fact based
[16]on analysis of facts. So, yeah, facts matter in a --
[17]or relate to opinions.
[18]Q How much land -- strike that. You based
[19]your opinions upon Mr. Farcht's report, correct?
[20]A In part.
[21]Q Okay. Because he came up with -- the land
[9]
[1]in question was approximately one-tenth of an acre,
[2]right?
[3]A The land upon which --
[4]Q The disputed land?
[5]A The disputed land, yes.
[6]Q Approximately one-tenth of an acre, and it
[7]was your opinion that the rental value of that
[8]one-tenth of an acre was over $ 2,000 per month?
[9]A I don't think so.
[10]Q That's what I saw.
[11]MR. CHANG: Can you point him to a page?
[12]Q Well, what do you think the rental value of
[13]that strip of land is?
[14]A I'm going to tell you in a second.
[15]Q Okay.
[16]A So I'm not sure where you got your answer.
[17]I would say that present value of the rental value of
[18]the 45 months is what I opined to, and that's $ 923.
[19]Q Okay. What is the -- what is 2,166 monthly
[20]rental value?
[21]A Where do you see that? I'm not following.
[10]
[1]Q Page 19.
[2]A That's the remainder.
[3]Q Okay. So you think that the value of --
[4]A Let me --
[5]Q Hang on. I'll ask the questions.
[6]A I know. I haven't finished my answer, and
[7]you already started.
[8]Q Finish your answer then. Go ahead.
[9]A I was going to direct you to the top of
[10]Page 19 because I believe your answer was with the land
[11]in dispute, that you believe that I had opined that it
[12]was worth 2,000 a month.
[13]What I'm directing you to the top part of
[14]the payment is $ 271 a month. The bottom part of the
[15]page is the remainder, and that is 2,166 a month. I
[16]was trying to orient you to the two different metrics.
[17]Q Okay. So the remainder is 2,166 per month?
[18]A Correct. For the land.
[19]Q For the land. Okay. And what does that
[20]mean?
[21]A Actually, it's land and improvement less
[11]
[1]the one-tenth of an acre.
[2]Q What does that mean?
[3]A So it's 5 --
[4]Q Go ahead. Go ahead. I cut you off. I
[5]apologize.
[6]A It's 5.9 acres less the one-tenth of an
[7]acre. So it's 5.9 acres, plus the contributory value
[8]of the improvements. That's the rental value per
[9]month.
[10]Q Looking at Page 19, your opinion that
[11]concludes an $ 88,737, please tell me what that
[12]reflects.
[13]A That reflects the unimpaired value,
[14]260,000, which is full property value, for the 45
[15]months rental value.
[16]Q In other words, it's approximately what
[17]somebody in the market would pay to rent their house
[18]for 45 months?
[19]A We say house. It's the entire property.
[20]Q The property?
[21]A Yes.
[12]
[1]Q So how is that relevant to this case?
[2]A Well, because the trespass is analogous to
[3]condemnation, a taking of private property. And that
[4]is how it is relevant. And this is a federal venue.
[5]So the before and after -- or federal rules. What's
[6]recognized is a basis upon which the court deems proper
[7]testimony under that rule for purpose of valuation.
[8]Q So just trying to basically understand what
[9]you are saying in layman's term, because I'm a layman
[10]in this context.
[11]A Well, layman's terms I'm saying that this
[12]is a finite appraisal problem. Finite in the sense of
[13]duration. The duration of the occupancy and cloud on
[14]title caused by the trespass and occupancy is
[15]approximately 45 months.
[16]And what is recognized is that for that
[17]purpose, when you have a taking of partial interest in
[18]a property for a short term, it is generally recognized
[19]under the federal court system in case law that the
[20]rental value is a proper metric upon which damages
[21]would be calculated.
[13]
[1]And here you've got a bifurcation of the
[2]property. You have the area of the trespass. Then you
[3]have the remainder. So the area of the trespass is,
[4]you know, what it would be indubitable equivalent to
[5]its market rent for that 45-month period. The
[6]remainder is impaired by virtue of its impaired
[7]marketability because of the cloud on title that one
[8]can't get typical title insurance without a special
[9]endorsement for.
[10]So the combination of those two things is
[11]what creates the damages of $ 94,000 in lay terms.
[12]Q All right. So let's just focus on this
[13]88,737.
[14]A Uh-huh.
[15]Q Are you suggesting that the Caseros engaged
[16]in a complete taking of this property?
[17]A They have impaired the value of the
[18]property by virtue of the 45 months, and so in essence,
[19]what a market value opinion assumes is the passing of
[20]title for consideration. So in order to effect a
[21]transfer of title, the consideration would be reduced
[14]
[1]by the impairment of the property. That's the way the
[2]market would recognize it and that impairment would be
[3]approximately $ 94,000 of --
[4]Q I'm just focused on the remainder for now.
[5]Let's stick with the remainder.
[6]A Uh-huh.
[7]Q The remainder. How much of the remainder
[8]did the Caseros take?
[9]A Well, they affected all of the remainder by
[10]virtue of the cloud on title attaches to a hundred
[11]percent of the property interest.
[12]Q I see. And so did the McNultys move out?
[13]A Well, it's not -- my opinion is not
[14]dependent upon the McNultys occupying the property.
[15]It's a hypothetical buyer and seller upon which market
[16]value is premised.
[17]Q So at least let me get -- the 2,166 per
[18]month that you've arrived at, that is supposed to
[19]reflect the approximate amount that the McNultys could
[20]have rented their property for per month?
[21]A Per month, and then it's discounted for the
[15]
[1]period of time.
[2]Q Meaning 45 months?
[3]A 45 months at a discount rate. In other
[4]words, the aggregate sum would be greater than the
[5]discounted value.
[6]Q Because it's money over time?
[7]A Time versus money, yes.
[8]Q Okay. You said earlier that this cloud on
[9]title is like condemnation?
[10]A No. I said the trespass --
[11]Q The trespass.
[12]A -- is analogous to a condemnation.
[13]Q Got you. And your opinion -- and your
[14]whole opinion assumes that, correct?
[15]A Well, I don't know when you say -- "assumes
[16]that," what do you mean by that?
[17]Q Good question. Your whole opinion that is
[18]stated in Farcht Exhibit Number 1 assumes that a
[19]trespass is analogous to a condemnation proceeding?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. I'm sorry. You
[21]said Farcht Exhibit Number 1?
[16]
[1]MR. COLLINS: Yes.
[2]THE WITNESS: This is Farcht 1. This what
[3]I understand.
[4]MR. CHANG: I'm sorry. Apologies. Okay.
[5]A And my answer would be, not necessarily
[6]because I relied primarily upon Judge Motz's opinion
[7]which is cited. I can direct you to that.
[8]Q I know where it is. I know what it says.
[9]A Okay.
[10]Q I'm quite familiar with that two-page
[11]opinion.
[12]A Okay.
[13]Q I have it practically memorized. All
[14]right?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q But the question I had was you're assuming
[17]that the trespass in this case was comparable to a
[18]condemnation proceeding, correct?
[19]A I wouldn't use "comparable." I would say
[20]analogous. It's used as a replacement.
[21]Q Analogous. And you're also assuming that
[17]
[1]you are valuing the full -- both the .1 of an acre and
[2]the rest of the property, correct?
[3]A Well, I valued the subject property
[4]relative to what I believe the appraisal problem
[5]requires with regard to the bifurcation of the
[6]component parts that were affected by both the trespass
[7]and then the cloud on title. So they are -- they are
[8]joined at the hip, but they are two different analyses.
[9]Q When you did your -- your analysis, did you
[10]look at rental valuation elsewhere?
[11]A No.
[12]Q You don't have any data on what rental
[13]values are for this kind of property in that location?
[14]A I didn't find an active rental market in
[15]that location. I did do a market study. I did do a
[16]very broad 10-mile radius search. I just didn't find
[17]it to be an activity rental market. In other words,
[18]properties weren't being acquired in that area for
[19]their capitalized rental value, they were being
[20]acquired for the amenity of home ownership.
[21]Q So what are -- what are the methods for
[18]
[1]valuing property, real estate?
[2]A Well, the three basics are -- the three
[3]basic approaches to value are cost approach, income
[4]capitalization approach, sales comparison approach.
[5]Q Cost, what?
[6]A Income capitalization and sales comparison.
[7]Q All right. So let's take one at a time.
[8]A Sure.
[9]Q Which one did you use?
[10]A Sales comparison.
[11]Q Sales comparison. And what does that
[12]consist of?
[13]A It's a comparative analysis of known
[14]transactions in order to derive the value of the
[15]property that is unknown as to its value, the subject
[16]property.
[17]Q Can you dumb that down for somebody with my
[18]education?
[19]A Sure. Sales comparison is a -- it relies
[20]on transactional data in the form of settled sales,
[21]listings and under contracts depending upon what is
[19]
[1]available in the market place. Those are known price
[2]points.
[3]And then a comparative analysis of the
[4]elements of comparison recognized in the appraisal
[5]profession are undertaken. And there is 11 such
[6]elements.
[7]Based upon a comparative analysis, one can
[8]draw a conclusion as to the valuation, the defined
[9]value being sought for the subject property which is an
[10]unknown.
[11]Q So, as I understand it, when I go and get a
[12]mortgage or I go to buy a new piece of property, I get
[13]somebody like you to go out and appraise the property,
[14]make sure that the mortgage company is not letting me
[15]borrow too much against it, right?
[16]A No. In that particular situation, the
[17]appraiser represents the lender, not the property
[18]owner. And all the lender cares about is whether there
[19]is surplus productivity to protect their investment,
[20]meaning if they are making you a loan of $ 80,000 on
[21]$ 100,000 price point, the lender wants to make sure
[20]
[1]that they can get out of that loan in the event they
[2]take the property back.
[3]Q All right. That's what I thought I said
[4]but just in different words. But that's okay.
[5]A Uh-huh.
[6]Q And what -- and you go out, and you make
[7]sure that the price I'm paying is at least pretty close
[8]to what the actual -- the property is actually worth
[9]and I can turn around the next day and sell?
[10]A Well, when you say I go out, I go out, and
[11]basically I will have already identified the appraisal
[12]problem at issue. And part of that identification
[13]would require the client to tell me a few things about
[14]the premise of the assignment such as the effective
[15]date, the defined value sought. Because it's not
[16]always market value. It could be insurance value. It
[17]could be investment value. There are different
[18]valuations being sought.
[19]Q Are you using fair market value here?
[20]A I used fair market value, yes.
[21]Q Okay. So I go and buy a house. I put a
[21]
[1]contract in on it. I want to pay $ 500,000 for it. And
[2]your role is to go out and check other comparable
[3]properties in the area to make sure that that's a fair
[4]price, right?
[5]A Well, my job is dependent upon who my
[6]client it.
[7]Q So it's a mortgage company. They want to
[8]make sure that they are not giving a loan for $ 550,000,
[9]right?
[10]A No. They can give a loan for $ 550,000, but
[11]they would seek probably additional cost
[12]collateralization.
[13]Q All right. Bottom line is you go out and
[14]you look at comparables, right?
[15]A If the relevant market is owner
[16]occupancy -- in many of homeownership -- I think sales
[17]comparison would be the preferred methodology?
[18]Q And that's what you did here?
[19]A That's what I did.
[20]Q And you came up with this property being
[21]worth $ 260,000, right?
[22]
[1]A That's correct.
[2]Q Okay. And then you came up with the
[3]opinion that even though the owner gets to remain
[4]there, use the property, for all intents and purposes,
[5]they have lost over $ 90,000 over the course of 45
[6]months?
[7]A Well, I don't totally understand your
[8]question. But let me take a stab at it because you had
[9]a compound question. The second part of the question
[10]was they got all utilization was it?
[11]Q Yes.
[12]A Well, they don't. That's the whole point.
[13]It's got impaired marketability by virtue of the Class
[14]4 detrimental condition caused by the trespass. So
[15]they don't have a hundred percent of their ability to
[16]--
[17]Q Of the remainder, though? But of the
[18]remainder they do?
[19]A They don't have that.
[20]Q Okay.
[21]A Because of the impaired marketability
[23]
[1]prevents them -- in other words, in your illustration,
[2]you have been using lenders. So a lender would not
[3]extend to them a hundred percent credit on the full
[4]value because it's impaired.
[5]Q Have you looked at any of the documents
[6]relating to their attempts to sell the property or
[7]anything like that?
[8]A No.
[9]Q Okay. Bottom line is you came up with
[10]the -- what you thought was -- the property value was
[11]$ 260,000, right?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q Okay. And that was based upon looking at
[14]comparables, correct?
[15]A Sales comparison approach, and that's what
[16]I would classify as the before condition, meaning under
[17]the hypothetical condition that no impairment existed.
[18]Q Okay. What was the taking in this case?
[19]A The taking was two-fold. It's the hundred
[20]percent of occupancy of the one-tenth of an acre where
[21]the trespass occurred, and then it's the taking of the
[24]
[1]hundred percent marketability interest in the remainder
[2]by virtue of the cloud on title.
[3]Q And how did they accomplish this?
[4]A I'm sorry?
[5]Q How do the Caseros accomplish this?
[6]MR. CHANG: Objection. I'm going to object
[7]here. You are asking questions related to liability,
[8]which obviously has already been decided.
[9]Q You can answer the question.
[10]A I don't look at parties. In other words,
[11]I -- I -- my valuations, hypothetical buyer and seller.
[12]So it doesn't matter who the parties are. Under a
[13]hypothetical buyer and seller concept, a owner seeking
[14]to potentially sell their property would be impaired by
[15]virtue of the same analogous situation that is present
[16]at the subject property. That's the way I looked at
[17]it.
[18]Q In what way did the Caseros occupy a
[19]hundred percent of this tenth of an acre?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[21]A My understanding is the one-tenth of an
[25]
[1]acre where it is situated is now utilized by the
[2]neighbor, the Caseros and Ms. Hattenburg. And when I
[3]visited the property and tried to orient to the area of
[4]trespass, you know, what is primarily displayed is a no
[5]trespassing sign. So, therefore, they have assumed all
[6]of the rights to that one-tenth of an acre based upon
[7]my opinion.
[8]Q Where? What did they do?
[9]MR. CHANG: Object to this line of
[10]questioning. Goes to liability. Liability has already
[11]been determined. Discovery is limited to damages and
[12]relief.
[13]MR. COLLINS: I understand that's your
[14]position.
[15]Q What did the Caseros do to assert dominion
[16]or control over this one-tenth of an acre, and did it
[17]vary from one part of another -- to another?
[18]MR. CHANG: I'm going to instruct you not
[19]to answer for the same objection, same reason.
[20]Q All right. So the bottom line is your
[21]opinion is founded upon the assumption that the Caseros
[26]
[1]exercised a hundred percent dominion and control over
[2]the one-tenth of an acre, correct?
[3]A It's not assumption. It's my opinion that
[4]they did that.
[5]Q Okay. All right. Now, isn't it true that
[6]the vast majority of the one-tenth of an acre that you
[7]are talking about is subject to a public easement?
[8]A It is true.
[9]Q Okay. So many people exercised dominion
[10]and control over that land by driving their cars or
[11]walking on it, correct?
[12]A No.
[13]Q What did the Caseros do that was different
[14]from other people to exercise dominion and control over
[15]all or any part of that one-tenth of an acre?
[16]A Well, the before condition, the same
[17]right-of-way existed. So the difference between the
[18]before and after is by virtue of the confiscation of
[19]the property, the installation of the driveway, its
[20]utilization as the front yard for the neighbor's
[21]property and no longer the front yard for the owner's
  27
[1]property, those are different criteria.
[2]Q So you are saying that they changed it
[3]from being the owner's front yard to their front yard?
[4]A Basically, yeah.
[5]Q How did they do that?
[6]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. Again,
[7]this is going to liability. This is strictly going to
[8]liability. If you want to ask him questions about his
[9]expert report, ask him questions about the expert
[10]report, but what you are doing is asking questions
[11]about liability which again has already been
[12]determined. You have already tried to -- you know,
[13]you've moved to reconsider. It has been denied. I
[14]mean we have gone over this before.
[15]MR. COLLINS: Exactly. You don't need to
[16]repeat yourself and waste my time either.
[17]MR. CHANG: I'm going to -- I'm going to
[18]instruct the client not to answer this question.
[19]THE WITNESS: I'm not the client, but I
[20]think you meant the expert.
[21]MR. CHANG: The witness. I apologize.
  28
[1]Q You are not client. The last one appeared
[2]to be a client. He used the attorney-client privilege
[3]to say not to answer questions. Are you his client?
[4]A I'm not. When you say "his," I think --
[5]Q Mr. Chang.
[6]A -- you are referring to Mr. Chang? I'm not
[7]Mr. Chang's client. Mr. Chang is defending this
[8]deposition.
[9]Q I understand. Okay. So does your opinion
[10]assume that the Caseros exercised a hundred percent
[11]dominion and control over the one-tenth of an acre?
[12]A Well, it is my opinion they have exerted a
[13]hundred percent control over the one-tenth acre.
[14]Q Great. Now tell me how you think that, why
[15]you think that. What facts are you basing that on?
[16]A The fact of the matter is is that I looked
[17]at the property before and after the trespass in April
[18]2014 when I understood the dispute commenced. And in
[19]looking at the changed complexity of the frontage --
[20]previously it was -- served as an additional barrier
[21]and privacy strip for the McNultys. They had an
  29
[1]improvement on there in the form of a fence.
[2]In the after condition, the former gravel
[3]bed driveway had been removed prior to the trespass.
[4]The old house that burned down.
[5]So the previous use of the right-of-way for
[6]a dual purpose of a parking apron had been negated. It
[7]had been eliminated.
[8]Under the new use -- under the trespass,
[9]there are two factors that I considered. One is that
[10]the landscaping is now integral to the
[11]Casero/Hattenburg property. The new driveway that
[12]services the improvement on the Casero/Hattenburg
[13]property is now the -- how the tenth of the acre
[14]functions for purposes of what is not part of the
[15]preexisting condition of the right-of-way. And there
[16]is a posting on that section of the property that
[17]advises all parties no trespassing. That it's
[18]asserting to the public ownership of that property.
[19]That property being owned by Casero and Hattenburg.
[20]Q Where is the posting?
[21]A Right on a tree that is to the west of the
  30
[1]new driveway.
[2]Q Is it -- whose land is it posted on?
[3]A It's posted I believe on the
[4]Casero/Hattenburg property.
[5]Q So why can't they post a no trespassing
[6]sign on their property?
[7]A Well, it gives the image to any
[8]hypothetical buyer/seller/renter, any party, that that
[9]-- they are asserting no trespassing to the area that
[10]functions as their property. That function includes
[11]that portion of the driveway that's on the McNulty
[12]property.
[13]Q The driveway you are only talking about?
[14]A The driveway is an extension of the
[15]Casero/Hattenburg property. The frontage along Salt
[16]Lake Drive, that has been modified to suit Casero to
[17]the detriment of McNulty. They have asserted a hundred
[18]percent control over that one-tenth strip of land that
[19]is outside of the roadway. And, again, the roadway was
[20]a preexisting condition. So my value before already
[21]took that into account. The only thing that has
[31]
[1]changed is the confiscation of the property rights by
[2]the neighbor to the south to the detriment of the
[3]neighbor to the north.
[4]Q They did that by putting up a driveway,
[5]right?
[6]A They did that by putting up the driveway.
[7]Q How much land is affected by the driveway?
[8]A I don't know.
[9]Q How much of the McNulty's land has an
[10]asphalt on it from the Casero's driveway?
[11]A I don't know.
[12]Q That is not relevant?
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[14]A No. It not relevant to my appraisal
[15]problem.
[16]Q What other conduct are you assuming the
[17]Caseros did to exercise dominion or control over
[18]anything besides the asphalted driveway?
[19]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. Again, it
[20]goes to liability. I'm going to instruct the witness
[21]not to answer.
[32]
[1]MR. COLLINS: Okay.
[2]Q Do you have any opinions regarding this
[3]case that he is going to let you answer?
[4]MR. CHANG: Objection. What kind of
[5]question is that, FJ?
[6]MR. COLLINS: Well, your instruction is
[7]absurd. We have been through this.
[8]MR. CHANG: I know.
[9]MR. COLLINS: So stop it. Please stop
[10]interrupting my deposition.
[11]MR. CHANG: Stop asking questions that go
[12]to liability and are outside the scope of discovery.
[13]Do you want me to show you the order that limits
[14]discovery to damages and relief?
[15]MR. COLLINS: It says "relief."
[16]MR. CHANG: Okay. And what --
[17]MR. COLLINS: Let me go on.
[18]Q What would it take to solve this problem,
[19]this cloud on title?
[20]MR. CHANG: Objection. Objection.
[21]Liability.
  33
[1]MR. COLLINS: How can you say that's
[2]liability.
[3]MR. CHANG: Instruct you not to answer.
[4]Q Do you have an opinion on how we could
[5]solve the problem of the cloud on title?
[6]MR. CHANG: Objection. Instructing the cli
[7]-- the witness not to answer.
[8]Q Did you use the income capitalization
[9]system or approach?
[10]A In part.
[11]Q For what?
[12]A For purposes of the net present value
[13]calculation, that's a function of a discounted value
[14]which is a form of yield capitalization of income
[15]capitalization.
[16]Q Okay. So in layman's term, shouldn't the
[17]analysis be how much could the McNultys rent their
[18]property for with the land being the way -- with the
[19]Caseros doing what they are doing, whatever that might
[20]be, versus with them not doing whatever they could do?
[21]A No. Because that only -- that only looks
[34]
[1]at the portion of the property no longer under their
[2]control, the one-tenth of an acre in dispute. It
[3]leaves unanswered the remainder impact.
[4]Q That's what I'm saying, with regard to the
[5]remainder, their ability to rent that property --
[6]right? That's what you are looking at, right?
[7]A No. As I said --
[8]Q The impact on their ability.
[9]MR. CHANG: Let him answer the question.
[10]A As I said in the beginning, the -- an
[11]expression of market value as defined assumes
[12]hypothetical buyer/seller passing of title for
[13]consideration. So the rental is indubitable equivalent
[14]of the impairment.
[15](The reporter asked for clarification.)
[16]A The indubitable equivalent of the
[17]impairment, but you still have to have the ability to
[18]convey title. And it's the cloud on title that impairs
[19]the remainder. So that might be that portion of the
[20]appraisal problem you've not yet analyzed.
[21]Q Let's start defining some terms.
  35
[1]A Okay.
[2]Q You've used the term "indubitable
[3]equivalent." What does that mean?
[4]A It's an arbiter recognized in the market
[5]place when -- in other words, like kind property
[6]impaired with a trespass isn't available, and its
[7]transaction value isn't available for analysis.
[8]So when there is paucity of that type of
[9]relevant data, direct comparison, the courts and case
[10]law from my perspective have recognized what do you
[11]look at as an analogous situation. The analogous
[12]situation is short-term rental value given the 45-month
[13]duration that effective date range applied to.
[14]Q What does "indubitable equivalent" mean? I
[15]still don't understand. Is that a term of art?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q Equivalent to what?
[18]A Analogous.
[19]Q I don't understand what that means.
[20]A Like kind.
[21]Q Like kind of what?
  36
[1]A To the appraisal problem at issue.
[2]Q I'm -- I'm just rather obtuse today.
[3]Forgive me.
[4]A Okay.
[5]Q I need this to be explained for a fourth
[6]grader.
[7]A All right.
[8]Q Okay.
[9]A Let me take another crack at it.
[10]Q Please.
[11]A The analysis of the rental value is the
[12]best real world scenario one can find to demonstrate to
[13]a jury or to a court what the potential impairment is
[14]to a property that's affected in that manner when a
[15]like kind property with the exact same trespass
[16]configuration isn't available for analysis because
[17]there are no such transactions. So you look at the
[18]next best thing.
[19]Q And what's the next best thing?
[20]A Well, the next best thing is recognizing
[21]what is the net present value of the rental value for
  37
[1]the two components that are subject to the detrimental
[2]condition.
[3]Q Okay.
[4]A And that rental value is assumed to reflect
[5]the impairment on the before value relative to
[6]recognizing the after value in its attendant condition.
[7]Q All right. So the term "indubitable" to me
[8]means unquestionable. Do you really mean to use that
[9]term?
[10]A Well, I think it would apply because in the
[11]cases that I have testified, and -- and the results
[12]that the juries have, or the courts have utilized, is
[13]they recognize that as an uninquestionable [sic]
[14]substitute to what can't be replicated in reality in
[15]the marketplace when there is a paucity of data.
[16]Q Okay. So what you are saying is since we
[17]can't find another example like this market data, we
[18]have to go to some other method of analyzing it, right?
[19]A That's correct.
[20]Q I'm just troubled by the word "indubitable
[21]equivalent." Whose decision is that it's indubitable?
  38
[1]A Well, it's -- it's my assertion that the
[2]capitalization of the lost rental value is the
[3]unquestionable substitute recognized by the courts when
[4]an actual impaired property transaction is not
[5]available for analysis.
[6]Q All right. So I'm just going to use the
[7]term equivalent because I can't deal with indubitable.
[8]A Sure. Sure.
[9]Q My wife doesn't accept it when I say
[10]something. Neither should you. Things that I say are
[11]not indubitable, and I don't think things that you say
[12]should be considered indubitable.
[13]So let's just talk about equivalence. What
[14]you are saying is that instead of using sales
[15]comparables, you are going to use rental value?
[16]A No.
[17]Q What are you using then?
[18]A Well, I have used sales comparables.
[19]What -- what was not available in the marketplace was a
[20]property with a similar impairment in the form of a
[21]trespass of a de minimis portion of the overall
  39
[1]property with improvement.
[2]Q Okay.
[3]A That would be a comparable. Here what I
[4]have used is substitute properties to establish the
[5]before value. There, that impairment didn't need to be
[6]recognized. To recognize the impairment, one would
[7]have to find a detrimental comparable. Those I didn't
[8]find.
[9]Q Okay. So the equivalent was? You used
[10]what?
[11]A The equivalent was to recognize under the
[12]duration of the date range for the effective date of my
[13]opinion -- to what is attached to my opinion, what the
[14]present value of lost rents would be --
[15]Q Okay.
[16]A -- which is what I understand the court
[17]recognizes in these situations.
[18]Q Let me ask you for a hypothetical. I want
[19]you to -- you could have determined the before value
[20]using rentals, couldn't you?
[21]A No. As I previously testified, my market
  40
[1]analysis of the entire area didn't recognize that there
[2]was an active rental market. In other words, that was
[3]not the impetus for people to acquire title to
[4]property, this type of property, residential property.
[5]It was primarily for the amenity of homeownership.
[6]Q I guess what I'm having a real hard time
[7]with is that you are comparing apples to oranges,
[8]aren't you?
[9]A Well, I'm looking at fruit as a generic
[10]category. And when there is no other apples, you look
[11]at the best substitute, and that would be an orange.
[12]But the court recognizes when there is no apples, you
[13]look at oranges. That is generally accepted appraisal
[14]practice in this type of application.
[15]Q But you're willing to look at the rental
[16]value on the after, but you are not comparing it to the
[17]rental value before, right?
[18]A No. I've looked at the interim impairment
[19]and the lost rents. That's what I'm actually looking
[20]at, that portion of the property which has been taken
[21]away.
[41]
[1]Q That's the rental value after, correct?
[2]A It's the rental value during.
[3]Q During. No, but after the first trespass?
[4]A Well, during.
[5]Q During the trespass? During the trespass?
[6]A Yes. The entire date range. The 45 months
[7]that I have assumed to be the period of trespass is
[8]what I'm coming up with the present value from which I
[9]am then deducting from the before value to get to the
[10]after value.
[11]Q So tell me, if you had been able -- well,
[12]let me ask you this. Rental value has some
[13]relationship to the sales value of the property, right?
[14]A Well, it can.
[15]Q I mean if you have a $ 5 million house, it's
[16]likely to rent for more than a $ 1 million house, right?
[17]A It depends upon the property. You know, it
[18]may not necessarily because the --
[19]Q On average.
[20]A Because the carrying costs of the $ 5
[21]million property to the tenant may be more adverse than
[42]
[1]the carrying cost on the $ 1 million property.
[2]Q All else being equal.
[3]A It's not a straight linear relationship is
[4]what I'm saying.
[5]Q If you were to compare the rental value of
[6]the property before 2014 to the rental value after
[7]2014, what would the difference be?
[8]A Well, in order to do that, there would have
[9]to be an active rental market to which two forms of
[10]data could be extracted. One would be comparable
[11]rents. Two would be the capitalization rate tied to
[12]those rentals in the form of a gross rent multiplier,
[13]some other metric. That data didn't exist based upon
[14]my inquiry.
[15]Q How did you come up with a rental value for
[16]after the trespass?
[17]A There is no rental value after the
[18]trespass. What I previously testified to and what I
[19]thought you agreed to was during the trespass.
[20]Q During. Well, during. I'm saying after
[21]the first trespass. But during the trespass how did
  43
[1]you come up with a rental value during the trespass but
[2]can't come up with a rental value before the trespass?
[3]A Well, because I looked at the short-term,
[4]metrics that would go into the cost of capital. So I
[5]looked at five-year notes, added 200 basis point to
[6]2.59 percent, which is the prevailing rate, plus the
[7]cost and time and management. The risk element. So
[8]that's where the five percent comes from. The 10
[9]percent is the reasonable return in the marketplace for
[10]that short term.
[11]And these are what the courts have
[12]recognized when there is not information available in
[13]the form of short-term rents of trespass property.
[14]These are what you look at, the alternative cost of
[15]capital.
[16]Q All right. For purposes of this appraisal
[17]assignment, Page 1, "I was asked to estimate the fair
[18]market value with and without Class 4 legal detrimental
[19]conditions." Who asked you that?
[20]A Well, that was the question posed to me by
[21]client's counsel.
  44
[1]Q Do you have the fair market value of the
[2]fee simple interest in the land?
[3]A In the property?
[4]Q In the property.
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q You have the fair market value of the fee
[7]simple interest?
[8]A I don't understand your question.
[9]Q You were asked to give the fair market
[10]value of the fee simple interest in the real estate?
[11]A Correct.
[12]Q Did you do that?
[13]A I did.
[14]Q What is the fair market value of the fee
[15]simple interest in 516 Salt Lake Road as of 2017?
[16]A Well, that would be with the Class 4
[17]conditions.
[18]Q Correct.
[19]A Yes. That would be --
[20]Q What is the fair market value of it?
[21]A That would be 260 less 94, which --
[45]
[1]$ 166,000.
[2]Q Is that really your answer?
[3]A That's my answer, yes.
[4]Q The fair market value? What a reasonable
[5]willing buyer would pay a willing seller?
[6]A As of the date that you provided, which is
[7]in the date range that I appraised, it's $ 166,000.
[8]Q So in what way do you find the Caseros'
[9]conduct impaired the McNultys' use of the property?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Goes to liability.
[11]MR. COLLINS: Does not.
[12]MR. CHANG: I'm going to instruct you not
[13]to answer.
[14]A I'm not looking at personal conduct, I'm
[15]looking at real estate, and I'm analyzing a piece of
[16]property that has impaired utilization.
[17]Q What is the impairment?
[18]A Well, the impairment is that the property
[19]is no longer attached to the front yard of the neighbor
[20]to the north, it is now being utilized to the neighbor
[21]to the south as an integral function of their front
  46
[1]yard, their access, their driveway. And what was
[2]removed was the fencing that was previously available
[3]for privacy and other mechanisms to the owner of the
[4]north. Those are the conditions that I've recognized
[5]at the property and the valuation problem attaches to.
[6]Q So it's your opinion that the fencing in
[7]question that was taken down was privacy -- had privacy
[8]in interest?
[9]A Sure. A fence is a barrier, and a barrier
[10]presents some form of privacy. It's not necessarily a
[11]screening privacy, but it tells the world that this is
[12]a barrier. And one would not necessarily cross that
[13]barrier unless they had the right to do that.
[14]Q Did that impair the value -- taking down
[15]that fence impair the value of the McNulty property?
[16]A Yeah. In part because it no longer serves
[17]as the basis for a -- an area of the front yard with a
[18]fence.
[19]Q What's the contributory value of that
[20]one-tenth of an acre?
[21]A Well, I didn't look at it that way because
  47
[1]it's all integral, it's not subdivision of a property.
[2]Q So let me ask it this way.
[3]A Okay.
[4]Q Somebody goes up and wants to pay $ 260,000
[5]for the McNulty property. Losing that one-tenth of an
[6]acre, is that going to impair their ability -- their
[7]willingness to pay $ 260,000 for that acre --
[8]MR. CHANG: Objection. Speculation.
[9]Q -- for that property?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Speculation.
[11]A It would depend upon the conditions
[12]associated with losing the one-tenth of an acre. Under
[13]the appraisal problem that I examined, the loss of the
[14]one-tenth of an acre also created a cloud on the title
[15]to the remainder property. So if you -- if your
[16]hypothetical is could the value -- is the value to be
[17]recognizable without a cloud on title, but by doing a
[18]boundary line adjustment of the one-tenth of an acre --
[19]I guess I don't understand your question. Maybe you
[20]can rephrase it for me.
[21]Q What is your assumption about the -- what
  48
[1]are you basing this assumption that there is a cloud on
[2]title?
[3]A Well, there was an encroachment. The
[4]encroachment is one-tenth of an acre. It's not an
[5]assumption. It's now part of the court record that
[6]that encroachment is of record and recognized by the
[7]court. And, therefore, that's a cloud on title.
[8]Q I don't understand why there is a cloud. I
[9]thought that the court decision determined that there
[10]is no cloud? That they own it?
[11]A They do own it, but it's still occupied.
[12]There is no -- there is no order of ejectment yet. And
[13]that's what I'm assuming will happen at the end of 45
[14]months is that there will be a final order of an
[15]ejectment, and then the cloud on title will be removed.
[16]Q The court -- counsel, Mr. Chang, has
[17]represented on multiple occasions that this is a final
[18]judgement that has been decided, that there is no cloud
[19]on title, that you guys own it, the McNultys own the
[20]property. So is there really a cloud on title still?
[21]MR. CHANG: I want to interject here. You
  49
[1]are misrepresenting my words now. I've never said
[2]"final judgement." There is a judgement in place.
[3]Q That there is a judgement. Anybody can
[4]look at this and see that there is no cloud on title,
[5]is there?
[6]A I think there is a cloud on title until the
[7]resolution of the case relative to the damage caused by
[8]the cloud on title is -- is adjudicated by the court.
[9]Q Okay. So you have assigned income
[10]production to this one-tenth sliver of land?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q How could that possibly happen?
[13]A Because as I have previously testified to,
[14]in the absence of transactional data of an identical or
[15]similar or like kind nature, it's generally accepted
[16]appraisal practice as recognized through accepted
[17]texts, treatises, case law that this is what an
[18]appraiser does to opine as to impact on value caused by
[19]impairment of one-tenth of an acre.
[20]Q As an appraiser, don't you have to look
[21]at -- let me use some things here.
  50
[1]MR. COLLINS: Can I have this marked as
[2]Harvey Exhibit 1.
[3](Harvey Exhibit 1 was marked for purposes
[4]of identification.)
[5]Q Do you know this document?
[6]A I do.
[7]Q Do you try to comport with it?
[8]A I do.
[9]Q Okay. Would you agree that you need to
[10]cross check your -- your opinions against other
[11]appraisal methods to make sure that they have
[12]credibility?
[13]A Depends.
[14]Q Because what I'm seeing is that you are
[15]saying that what the Caseros did is worth close to the
[16]full amount of what their property -- the McNulty
[17]property would have rented for for the 45 months?
[18]A Again, the portion of the property impaired
[19]and then the impairment to the remainder is what I
[20]valued the net present value for during the duration of
[21]the impairment. And that is my opinion.
[51]
[1]Q Okay. But when you are making an
[2]appraisal, don't you have to look at all of the facts?
[3]A Well, you look at the relevant facts.
[4]Q Okay. So let's do an analogy. I have an
[5]on going business. I have Subway shop, and in my
[6]Subway shop, I'm making $ 1,000 per month.
[7]A Uh-huh.
[8]Q And then I find out that there is a cloud
[9]on my title, and I have to go to court to get that
[10]cloud on title removed, but during the entire time I'm
[11]using the Subway -- I've got the Subway shop I'm still
[12]making $ 1,000 per month in net profit.
[13]A Uh-huh.
[14]Q What is the impaired value? Is it the full
[15]amount of $ 1,000 a month.
[16]A Where the Subway located? Maryland?
[17]Q Yes.
[18]A In Maryland, the federal courts have
[19]recognized that real estate impairment is secondary to
[20]lost business profits, and if you were to look at the
[21]Lord & Taylor versus White Flint case, which went up on
[52]
[1]appeal in fourth district, they came down on that. So
[2]it's unique to Maryland. But that's the remedy.
[3]Q What is?
[4]A When you have an operating business and you
[5]allege some impairment of that by virtue of a breach of
[6]contract or impairment of real estate, the measure of
[7]lost for the business is loss profits for the business.
[8]It's unique to Maryland, and the case that I would
[9]recommend you look at is Lord & Taylor versus White
[10]Flint.
[11]Q So in that situation, what would the --
[12]what would the impairment be?
[13]A Well, it would be the capitalization of the
[14]lost business profits.
[15]Q So I was still making 1,000. I was making
[16]1,000, and now I'm still making 1,000. There is no
[17]loss, right?
[18]A Well, I don't know what you mean by
[19]"making." Are you netting 1,000?
[20]Q Yes. Netting.
[21]A I don't see how you can net 1,000 because
  53
[1]under your analogy there would be the recognition of
[2]some increased cost to the business by virtue of the
[3]changed condition of the real estate that you are
[4]saying is potentially affecting, and that lost profit
[5]would, therefore, be the increase in the carrying costs
[6]in your hypothetical.
[7]Q No. There is just a cloud. It doesn't
[8]affect how many people walk in my door and buy subways
[9][sic] from me?
[10]A Well, a cloud is an adverse material
[11]condition. So if you use your property as collateral,
[12]you would have a loan covenant. You would be required
[13]to report to your lender that there is change in the
[14]MAC clause. And that lender would elect to either call
[15]the note -- you would have the cost of replacing the
[16]financing, or that lender could self insure for the
[17]cloud and provide you the supplemental endorsement.
[18]But there would -- I believe there would be a
[19]recognizable and material -- not trivial -- cost to the
[20]business which would impair and would be capitalized in
[21]the form of lost profit in that hypothetical.
  54
[1]Q Is there -- is there ever a cloud on title
[2]that doesn't have an impairment in value?
[3]A Well, it depends upon what the cloud would
[4]be. But a cloud -- a cloud would always have an
[5]impairment. The question could insurance over the
[6]cloud by virtue of something that would be recognized
[7]in the market as preferrable to leaving the condition
[8]in place.
[9]Q Do you know Randall Bell?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Okay.
[12](Harvey Exhibit 2 was marked for purposes
[13]of identification.)
[14]Q Is this the article upon which your
[15]analysis was done, based -- based?
[16]A No. This is the 1998 appraisal journal
[17]article -- the appraisal journal article upon which was
[18]the origin of Mr. Bell's theories. The case -- the
[19]actual publication that I relied upon was authored by
[20]Randall Bell, but it's the third edition of Real Estate
[21]Damages published by the Appraisal Institute. So you
  55
[1]will find some parallels, but they are not -- they
[2]don't match up.
[3]Q Isn't it recognized in this article and the
[4]book that you are talking about that there are
[5]impairments that have no impact on the value?
[6]A That would be Class 1, benign impairment.
[7]It would be recognized as an impairment that doesn't
[8]impact value. Yes, there is a potential for that.
[9]Q And many of the words and graphs and
[10]pictures that you used in your report come straight
[11]from this or the book, right?
[12]A Well, it comes from the book, not from
[13]this. This is no longer recognized. It's out -- out
[14]of date. It has been replaced, as I said, by the third
[15]edition of the book.
[16](Harvey Exhibit 3 was marked for purposes
[17]of identification.)
[18]Q Have you ever seen this document?
[19]A I have not.
[20]Q Did you consider Randall Bell to be an
[21]expert in your field?
[56]
[1]A When you say the "field," I'm not sure what
[2]field.
[3]Q In your field.
[4]A And the field is real estate valuation?
[5]Q Yes.
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q And would you consider his writings to be
[8]authoritative?
[9]A Depends upon his writings.
[10]Q Have you ever disagreed with any of his
[11]writings?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q What have you disagreed with?
[14]A Mr. Bell valued the Gettysburg Tower for
[15]purposes of the Department of the Interior, and in that
[16]analysis, Mr. Bell's opinion did not carry the day.
[17]Mr. Lyndhoff's (phonetic) did. I agree with Mr.
[18]Lyndhoff's methodology over Mr. Bell's. And that's a
[19]published case.
[20]Q Any others?
[21]A Yeah, there are. I just can't remember
  57
[1]which one it is. It was a patrol [sic] and impairment
[2]case.
[3]Q Look at Page -- the page that -- Page 8.
[4]A Okay. I may have to read the whole thing,
[5]but let me -- you direct me to what you want me to look
[6]at, and I'll tell you if I can answer it out of
[7]context.
[8]Q "When value indications are substantially
[9]different, careful analysis of the valuation data used,
[10]and assumptions made, is needed to determine which
[11]value indicator is the most reliable. In the final
[12]reconciliation, the appraiser reconsiders the entire
[13]appraisal, making sure the data available and analyt --
[14]analytical techniques and logic applied have led to
[15]consistent judgements." Do you agree with that
[16]statement?
[17]A I do.
[18]Q So this is -- again, down to a fourth
[19]grader, please. The problem I have with your report
[20]that is just hitting me in the face -- and maybe I'm
[21]missing something. I need you to explain it to me.
  58
[1]And that is, that you are coming up with the impairment
[2]of this property is very close to what the total value
[3]of that property would be over those 45 months if they
[4]were to just go and rent it out. Am I wrong about
[5]that?
[6]A Yes. When you say they would rent it out,
[7]if they rented it out, they would rent it at -- the
[8]property recognized on the marketplace generally was
[9]going to be a hundred percent of the property rights
[10]that McNultys hold. And in order -- that would be a
[11]whole property. And really what is -- the question is
[12]what can you rent out a partial interest to the
[13]property for by virtue of why is there a partial
[14]interest. Because part of the property has been
[15]occupied, been trespassed on, occupied upon. And how
[16]does that affect the remainder of the property.
[17]Well, if you were going to sell it and --
[18]if you looked at either side of the Mason-Dixon line,
[19]Maryland area realtors and the Pennsylvania area
[20]realtors, they use the exact same language in their
[21]recognized standard form contract for residential
  59
[1]property, and in there it says there cannot be any
[2]encroachment, easement, or so forth, that causes a
[3]special endorsement to the title policy.
[4]And in this particular case, there is that
[5]encroachment. I understand what you said about the
[6]court order, but I think the court's order was only a
[7]portion -- one prong of the case that is at issue, and
[8]that was who was liable.
[9]Now the court is yet to find what the
[10]damages are. My opinion goes to damages, not
[11]liability.
[12]Q You didn't answer my question.
[13]A I thought I did.
[14]Q You didn't.
[15]A Okay.
[16]Q I said for a fourth grader -- I'm seeing
[17]that if they got $ 260,000 piece of property, they might
[18]be able to rent it out for about $ 2,000 a month. And
[19]you are assessing $ 2,000 a month as their damage even
[20]though they got to stay there the whole time?
[21]A Okay. I think I understand where the
  60
[1]disconnect is.
[2]Q That would be great if you can explain it.
[3]A Now, in the -- I'm going to walk you
[4]through the report. You might want to mark some of
[5]this. So go to 7 -- Page 7, if you would please. In
[6]the fair market value opinion -- definition, second
[7]full paragraph, "Fair market value for purposes of this
[8]appraisal [sic] is defined as what a willing buyer" --
[9]buyer, not renter, buyer -- "would pay in cash to a
[10]willing seller at the time of the taking." Okay.
[11]And that is what I'm recognizing. That
[12]what is being sold is a property upon which partial
[13]occupancy remains but cannot be insured relative to
[14]commercial title insurance requirement without a
[15]special endorsement even if a special endorsement were
[16]available. So one has to recognize what is the impact
[17]on the remainder of that inability to get title
[18]insurance without a special endorsement, or to get
[19]title insurance at all. That's one half of the
[20]equation.
[21]The other half of the equation is if I'm
[61]
[1]selling this property and recognize the one-tenth of an
[2]acre -- I'm selling you this property. You are going
[3]to own it. You are going to pay taxes on it. You are
[4]going to insure it, but you lost your use. The fence
[5]that I would have conveyed to you is no longer there
[6]because the neighbor took it, and the neighbor took the
[7]one-tenth of an acre as his own property -- has their
[8]own property. And they have improved it with a now
[9]integrated improvement -- site improvement that
[10]services their property, not our property. Ours being
[11]the seller.
[12]So in the context of the definition of the
[13]value being sought here, I think I have answered your
[14]question.
[15]Q Not in a way I can understand it. Let me
[16]make that clear. I'm not understanding what you are
[17]saying.
[18]A I can tell --
[19]Q But I am going to keep trying.
[20]A Sure. Let me -- let me take one more bite
[21]of the apple, and I'll finish my answer.
  62
[1]This definition of value comes from the
[2]footnote Kirby Force Industries by U.S.. That was also
[3]in --
[4]Q I have no problem with your definition of
[5]fair market value. I learned that the first --
[6]A I was going to put -- I was going to put it
[7]in context for you. If you read Columbia Gas
[8]Transmission, LLC v. Joyce, et al. That was Judge
[9]Motz's opinion which was upheld by the fourth district,
[10]and in that context, it was Judge Motz who ruled that
[11]the impairment of the properties that were subject to
[12]temporary construction easements, a temporary duration,
[13]the occupancy by a third party, not the owner, that the
[14]proper metric is the rental value of the property as
[15]impaired. And -- so you might want to read that case.
[16]Maybe it will help you understand where I'm coming from
[17]on my opinion.
[18]Q Okay. But they were deprived of their
[19]entire use of the property?
[20]A No. It was similar. It still holds the
[21]world together, but it was -- now the occupancy of the
  63
[1]property went to Columbia Gas. The owner of the
[2]property, subject to Columbia Gas' temporary occupancy
[3]and trespass, still paid the taxes, still paid the
[4]insurance on the property, but they didn't have
[5]physical use of that property other than it held the
[6]world together.
[7]Q Doesn't the fact that the McNultys have
[8]physical use of the property impact this opinion at
[9]all?
[10]A Well, when you say "the property," are you
[11]talking about the remainder, or the area of the
[12]trespass?
[13]Q The remainder.
[14]A Yes, but their use is limited. In other
[15]words, under the definition being sought --
[16]Q They can't sell, but they can use it?
[17]A Right. But the fact is that fee simple
[18]gives you the right to occupy, sell, rent or do
[19]nothing. But they have been denied a partial -- the
[20]bundle of sticks that they held before the trespass has
[21]been reduced because now they can't sell it because of
  64
[1]encroachment, because of the cloud on title. And
[2]that's being recognized in that appraisal problem.
[3]Q All right. This is what I want you to do
[4]for me. You've done your methodology. I want you to
[5]answer a hypothetical question. What is the difference
[6]in sale price that the McNultys could get for their
[7]property if they were to file a quit claim deed to that
[8]one-tenth of the property -- one-tenth of an acre and
[9]sell the rest?
[10]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[11]speculation.
[12]A Okay. I'm not sure I follow you. They
[13]could file a quit claim deed to the tenth of an acre?
[14]Q Yes. So there is no more cloud on title
[15]because they don't own it.
[16]A They are conveying it to a third party, a
[17]another party?
[18]Q Just to the world.
[19]A But I mean filing a quit claim deed, you
[20]could file -- it's not a confirmatory quit claim deed.
[21]I don't understand what you mean by file a quit claim
  65
[1]deed. Meaning they are deeding the property to some
[2]other party?
[3]Q Record a quit claim deed that says we don't
[4]want any or have any interest in that one-tenth of an
[5]acre.
[6]A Okay.
[7]Q And then sell the remainder. What would
[8]the sale price be of that remainder?
[9]A That's not an appraisal I did.
[10]Q I understand. What do you think it would
[11]have -- about how much money would it be? How much in
[12]a diminution in value would they experience?
[13]A You asking me to -- under your
[14]hypothetical, you are asking me to violate the
[15]standards of valuation practice. I cannot do that.
[16]Q Why can't you?
[17]A Because it would require me to go get --
[18]follow the valuation process. The same things that I
[19]have done here. I would have to define the premises,
[20]the date, and then collect the data.
[21]Q Okay. So let's do that for a minute.
  66
[1]Let's look at your data. You came up with $ 260,000 in
[2]Exhibit 5, correct?
[3]A Correct.
[4]Q You did that based upon three other
[5]comparables, correct?
[6]A That's correct.
[7]Q Okay. Comparable 1 in Delta, Pennsylvania,
[8]how much land in it?
[9]A 4.73 acres.
[10]Q Comparable 2 had how much?
[11]A 6.61.
[12]Q Comparable 3 had?
[13]A 9.
[14]Q So despite their variations, you were able
[15]to use those comparables to come up with an opinion
[16]regarding the value of the McNulty property, correct?
[17]A That's correct.
[18]Q So I'm asking you to look at the subject
[19]property --
[20]A Uh-huh.
[21]Q -- and make only one change, reduce the
[67]
[1]land size by one-tenth of an acre. How much would that
[2]impair the fair market value of it?
[3]A If you look on the bottom of the page,
[4]you'll see I didn't use the land area as the unit of
[5]comparison. I used the GLA, the living area. So I
[6]can't answer your question without going back and
[7]reanalyzing the data.
[8]Q Come on. You used there other doc -- three
[9]other properties that are far different from their
[10]property. Hang on. Let me ask my question.
[11]A Sure.
[12]Q You used three properties that were
[13]substantially different from theirs to arrival at a
[14]value, correct?
[15]A Correct.
[16]Q And I'm asking you to just change the
[17]subject property by a very small change, and you can't
[18]come up with a value?
[19]MR. CHANG: Objection. Asked and answered.
[20]A Yeah. You are asking me to do -- opine on
[21]an appraisal that I have not yet performed.
  68
[1]Q That minor difference is far less than
[2]these other variations, isn't it?
[3]A Well, what you described as minor is a new
[4]appraisal assignment under the generally accepted
[5]appraisal practice and the rules that I have to follow
[6]by virtue of the state licenses. It is a new
[7]assignment. I haven't fulfilled the entire valuation
[8]process, to answer your question, and I'm not going to
[9]answer your question for that reason because I can't.
[10]It violates the -- the license requirements that I'm
[11]sitting here as an expert to qualify on.
[12]Q Come on. You can take three that are very
[13]different and give an opinion, but you can't take the
[14]one and the three together, make one minor change to
[15]this one, and answer that question?
[16]MR. CHANG: Objection. You are harassing
[17]the witness at this point. Asked and answered.
[18]Q Can you do that?
[19]A I can't do it sitting here today and adhere
[20]to professional standards.
[21]Q What would it take to do it?
  69
[1]A What would it take?
[2]Q Yeah.
[3]A It would take recognition of the appraisal
[4]problem, requisite time to go out, find the
[5]information, analyze it and get back to you under the
[6]transmittal that we agree upon either oral or written.
[7]Q You have all the data that you need, right?
[8]A Based upon your hypothetical?
[9]Q Yes.
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Okay. I'm asking you to do that, and I'm
[12]paying you today to sit here. And I'm going to pay you
[13]to do it right now.
[14]A Well, you are going to pay me to answer
[15]questions on virtue of the appraisal that I have
[16]already performed and it's been entered into the record
[17]here.
[18]Q So you are not going to do it today?
[19]A I'm not going to do an appraisal assignment
[20]sitting here under oath that would not conform to the
[21]appraisal standards I'm required to comply with, yes.
  70
[1]Q How long would it take you to do it?
[2]A A couple days.
[3]Q It would take you a couple of days even
[4]though you have all the data already? Why would it
[5]take you a couple of days? Why couldn't you just
[6]change the words a little bit in the one you already
[7]have done?
[8]A Because I don't have time to change the
[9]words a little bit given what other requirements I have
[10]on my schedule.
[11]Q Did you consider at all the value of the --
[12]that a few years ago the McNultys purchased an
[13]additional lot as of 2013 for $ 800?
[14]A I'm aware of the purchase. Did I consider
[15]it, no. It wasn't comparable for purposes of the
[16]analysis.
[17]Q I mean wouldn't that be kind of the --
[18]A No. Because of the area in question was a
[19]triangular shape, it didn't contribute the same
[20]frontage that the property being trespassed upon did.
[21]It has an entirety different utility.
[71]
[1]MR. COLLINS: Let me use this as the next
[2]exhibit.
[3](Harvey Exhibit 4 was marked for purposes
[4]of identification.)
[5]Q I want to show you a photograph that has
[6]been marked as Harvey Exhibit Number 4. This is an
[7]aerial photograph of the respective properties taken in
[8]2008. If you can look over --
[9]A Can I ask you a question?
[10]Q Are you oriented to it?
[11]A No. Because you said 2008, and this date
[12]on Harvey 4 is 11-03-2014.
[13]Q That's when it was printed out. This is an
[14]aerial photograph 2008.
[15]A Okay.
[16]Q Let me just point a couple of things out to
[17]you to help orient you.
[18]A Sure.
[19]Q This is the house that burned down.
[20]A Uh-huh.
[21]Q Okay.
  72
[1]A Archer?
[2]Q This is the fence we are talking about.
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q Okay. This is the McNultys' fence. You
[5]have seen it before, right?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q Okay. So can I ask, looking at that, do
[8]you have any reason to believe that the fence on the
[9]south side -- that's Salt Lake Road going right across
[10]it --
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q -- is there any reason you have to believe
[13]that fence was ever used for privacy of the McNulty
[14]property?
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[16]speculation.
[17]A Well, as I previously testified, the fence
[18]is a barrier, and barriers create in effect a privacy
[19]element. So I believe it did produce some element of
[20]privacy.
[21]Q Looking at this, isn't it clear that fence
  73
[1]was used as a barrier for the meadow on the west side
[2]of the property, the Casero property?
[3]A It was.
[4]Q Okay. Of the meadow on the Casero
[5]property.
[6]A Understood.
[7]Q Is that right?
[8]A Yes. I said yes.
[9]Q Okay. It's certainly not to enclose a
[10]meadow on the north side of Salt Lake Road, correct?
[11]A When you say "it" --
[12]Q The fence.
[13]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[14]speculation.
[15]A The existing fence in 2008 extended as
[16]shown in Harvey 4. The ability to extend the fence
[17]further still existed on that date and was -- that
[18]ability and that right was held by the McNultys, and
[19]that is what has been confiscated.
[20]Q To extend it where?
[21]A As far to the east as their property line
  74
[1]exists, which is just before Big Creek Stream.
[2]Q What I'm talking about is that that
[3]property line -- excuse me, that fence is clear from
[4]this aerial photograph was used to enclose that meadow,
[5]was it not?
[6]A I wouldn't say it would enclose the meadow
[7]because there is gaps in the meadow. What it shows me
[8]is it was awareness to the public that there was a
[9]barrier here that should be recognized, and that's all
[10]it recognize -- that's all it demonstrates.
[11]Q Did you assume for purposes of your -- your
[12]opinion that the entire fence was on the McNulty
[13]property?
[14]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. That goes
[15]to liability, and I'm going to -- you can answer.
[16]A Can you explain to me? I don't understand
[17]your question. "Entire fence," I'm not sure what that
[18]means.
[19]Q The Caseros were accused of trespass by
[20]tearing down a fence, right?
[21]A Correct.
  75
[1]Q Do you know whether that entire fence was
[2]on the McNulty property, or only part of it?
[3]A I can't tell you from looking at this. I
[4]presume that a portion was on Archer's corner and that
[5]the balance was on McNulty's property.
[6]Q You assume that. Why do you assume that?
[7]A Because of the -- I believe the demarcation
[8]between the two boundaries which was the subject, as I
[9]understand, of other litigation that has been resolved
[10]between Archer and Casero and Hattenburg. Resolved
[11]this line.
[12]Q I'm talking about the east-west fence that
[13]was allegedly taken down.
[14]A Uh-huh.
[15]Q Do you know whether --
[16]A I can't tell you whether it was a hundred
[17]percent on McNulty property or a portion was also on
[18]Archer. I can't tell you that. I don't know.
[19]Q How about it being a portion on the Casero
[20]property? Did you assume that?
[21]A No, I did not.
  76
[1]Q So you assumed that the entire fence was
[2]either owned by the Archers or the McNultys?
[3]A I only assumed that the portion of the
[4]fence that -- that McNultys replaced was on their
[5]property and no other property.
[6]Q Was on the Cas -- was on the McNulty
[7]property?
[8]A Correct, that's all I assumed.
[9]Q Okay. And, obviously, if that's not true,
[10]that would have effect your opinion, correct?
[11]A If what's not true?
[12]Q If part of the fence was not on the McNulty
[13]property, that would impact your opinions, correct?
[14]A No. Because as I just stated, the only
[15]thing I assumed was that the portion of the fence that
[16]McNulty sought to rebuild was on their property.
[17]Q So you are assuming that the fence was on
[18]the McNulty property?
[19]MR. CHANG: Objection. I'm going to, one,
[20]object and instruct the client not answer because this
[21]is again going to liability.
  77
[1]MR. COLLINS: Not a client.
[2]MR. CHANG: Witness. Thank you.
[3]MR. COLLINS: You are instructing the
[4]witness not to answer that question.
[5]MR. CHANG: That's correct.
[6]MR. COLLINS: Even though it goes to
[7]damages --
[8]MR. CHANG: It goes to liability.
[9]MR. COLLINS: -- and remedies?
[10]MR. CHANG: It goes to liability. It goes
[11]to liability.
[12]MR COLLINS: It goes to remedies too.
[13]MR. CHANG: Okay. Same objection. Same
[14]instruction.
[15]Q Okay. So does -- does your opinion assume
[16]anything regarding who -- whose land the fence was on?
[17]A The contributory value of fence that is
[18]incorporated in my analysis assumes that that portion
[19]of the fencing is on the McNultys' property as I have
[20]defined it.
[21]Q Okay. Now, if -- if the property in
[78]
[1]question -- strike that. Does your opinion assume that
[2]the McNultys had the full use and authority over the
[3]one-tenth of an acre?
[4]A I don't understand year question. My
[5]opinion is a damage element. Are you saying before the
[6]trespass?
[7]Q Correct. Before -- before the trespass.
[8]A Subject to the existing easement of the
[9]right-of-way.
[10]Q Does your opinion assign income production
[11]to this one-tenth of an acre?
[12]A When you say "income production" --
[13]Q For purpose of -- for purposes of --
[14]A Lost rent is, what, $ 271 a month.
[15]Q Pardon?
[16]A The -- that's what I pointed out to you, I
[17]think, on Page 16 on the upper paragraph, if I can find
[18]my copy. Is that it? It's not 16.
[19]MR. CHANG: 19.
[20]A 19. $ 271 is the annual rent for that
[21]one-tenth of an acre, and it is 2,250 for a month is
  79
[1]what I assigned to the one-tenth of an acre as to its
[2]rental value -- short-term rental value for the 45
[3]months.
[4]Q So going back to -- same page. The one
[5]about 88,000. And walk me into your analysis on
[6]that -- walk me through your analysis on that again.
[7]A It recognizes the entire property, the
[8]$ 260,000 value, and what its short-term rental value
[9]would be under the 45-month time frame.
[10]Q So do the math for me, and explain it as
[11]you go.
[12]A 260 times 10 percent is the rate of return
[13]on the short-term rental.
[14]Q Hang on. So you are assuming that they
[15]would make --
[16]A 10 percent on the asset value as a rate of
[17]return for rental purposes.
[18]Q Where did you come up with that?
[19]A That is based upon the replacement cost of
[20]capital indexes published by the Appraisal Institute as
[21]of these dates.
  80
[1]Q Can you tell me which ones you are talking
[2]about?
[3]A I can tell you where to go get it.
[4]Q Please.
[5]A Yeah. Go to the Appraisal Institute's
[6]website, www.appraisalinstitute.org. On the top menu   6 website, www.appraisalinstitute.org. On the top menu
[7]line there is five or six submenus, and the one you
[8]want is economic indicators. And then there are
[9]various rates of return produced for like -- in other
[10]words, the riskless rate would be a five-year treasury
[11]bond. And for the risk element of private property,
[12]you add to that. But if you look at those indexes
[13]you'll find various indexes that I looked at as to
[14]alternative investment criteria to opine that the 10
[15]percent was a reasonable return.
[16]Q So a rate of return for rental prop -- a
[17]reasonable rate of return for rental property is 10
[18]percent is basically what you are saying?
[19]A Is what I'm saying, yes.
[20]Q Go ahead.
[21]A So 260 times 10 percent gives you an annual
[81]
[1]rent of $ 26,000 a year divided by 12 gives you a
[2]monthly rent of let's say 2,167 rounded. Because it's
[3]an amount to be received periodically into the future,
[4]I then discounted back to a net present value at five
[5]percent. So the 40.955 is the net present value factor
[6]at -- periodically at five percent discounted monthly
[7]for 45 months. Beginning of the period. Convention.
[8]Q Five percent annual safe rate, what is
[9]that?
[10]A Well, safe rate is -- in other words, if
[11]you put your money in a money market, you are not even
[12]going to get one percent. So a safe rate would be if
[13]you went to your bank and you negotiated -- I want to
[14]do a one-year CD or I want to do a three-year. It is
[15]basically a riskless rate that you want to have the
[16]money available at the end of the holding. So it's
[17]called a safe rate by definition.
[18]Q So you are saying they could buy a 45-month
[19]CD for about five percent? Something like that?
[20]A Yeah. I mean -- well, it's a comparative
[21]rate that doesn't render the risk element as a function
  82
[1]of return. So it's a relatively riskless rate because
[2]real estate investments carry with it risks over and
[3]above what a financially -- financial institution CD
[4]insured by the government would bring.
[5]Q So you did -- you did the reduction by
[6]taking the 45 months and reducing to 40.955 months? Is
[7]that the two numbers that we are dealing with?
[8]A Well, that's the net present -- the present
[9]value factor is -- that's the factor for a compound
[10]discount rate of five percent annually using monthly
[11]compounding for 45 months.
[12]Q I've done present value before. But
[13]normally you take the 2,166.67 for 45 months, and you
[14]put in your rate of return. And it doesn't use a
[15]factor like 40.955, but it does give you a result. Is
[16]that doing the same thing?
[17]A Yes. It's doing the exact --
[18]mathematically you are doing the exact same thing, yes.
[19]Q That's what I thought. Okay. All right.
[20]So -- so the highest and best use of the property is as
[21]a residence?
  83
[1]A Correct.
[2]Q Okay. The before and the after that you
[3]are looking at are before what?
[4]A Well, before the impairment. Before the
[5]occupancy, the trespass.
[6]Q What did you see as the start date?
[7]A April 2014.
[8]Q And what was that event?
[9]A That was the -- my understanding, by virtue
[10]of the documents I reviewed, when the McNultys were
[11]aware of the trespass, and that commenced the period of
[12]time. If you look on Page 9, there is a footnote
[13]there. Footnote 8. It explains the date range. April
[14]24, 2014 when the land owners first discovered the
[15]encroachment on the subject property.
[16]Q Okay. How much were you -- how much time
[17]did it take you to do your report?
[18]A Well, it was a fixed fee. I didn't do a
[19]census of my time, but I mean --
[20]Q How much time, about?
[21]A Just in travel alone, it was six hours.
  84
[1]Probably another 10 or 12 hours of processing, and one
[2]or two hours for the report.
[3]Q So that would be six hours of travel?
[4]A Six hours of travel?
[5]Q Uh-huh.
[6]A Probably another five or six hours for
[7]analyzing -- collecting data, analyzing.
[8]Q Okay. Then what?
[9]A And then another hour or two to write the
[10]report.
[11]Q Does 14 hours sound about right?
[12]A That would be correct.
[13]Q Okay. You've listed 24 cases in which you
[14]have given deposition or trial -- and/or trial
[15]testimony, right?
[16]A Let me double check.
[17]Q Page 2 through 5 or 6.
[18]A 24 cases in the last four years.
[19]Q Okay. How many of those did you use the
[20]detrimental conditions analysis?
[21]A You want me to go through and tell you?
  85
[1]I'll give you the case number. 1. 3. 6. 8. 9. 11.
[2]14. 17. 20. 21. That would be it.
[3]Q Were you -- was your opinion ever excluded
[4]by the court?
[5]A I have had an opinion excluded by the court
[6]which is where I gave you that information about lost
[7]business profits. Let's see where is it? 17. Again,
[8]the -- Judge Titus ruled that in Maryland the remedy
[9]available to the plaintiff, Lord & Taylor, was lost
[10]business profits, not impairment of real estate values.
[11]So, therefore, he said my real estate opinions were not
[12]helpful to the court and were excluded.
[13]Q Any others?
[14]A That's it.
[15]Q Okay. So Page 6, fee simple interest.
[16]A Yes, sir.
[17]Q It is clear that at least as to the
[18]one-tenth of an acre, they did not have fee simple
[19]interest in that property, correct?
[20]A Well, I believe what they hold is fee
[21]simple interest. I believe what you are recognizing is
  86
[1]that there was an encumbered -- potentially encumbered
[2]fee by virtue of the roadbed?
[3]Q Yes.
[4]A I'm just trying to get to -- what they
[5]owned was a hundred percent fee simple interest. Their
[6]title was a hundred percent fee simple interest.
[7]Q That's not true, is it?
[8]A I think it is true.
[9]Q I mean, if there is a right-of-way, that's
[10]not fee simple, is it?
[11]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object here. You
[12]are asking for a legal conclusion.
[13]MR. COLLINS: Well, he uses the term here
[14]in his report.
[15]MR. CHANG: You are asking for a legal
[16]conclusion. So I'm objecting.
[17]MR. COLLINS: I don't care. He uses it in
[18]his report.
[19]A It is the fee simple interest that I
[20]valued, and in my due diligence in looking if there was
[21]-- there is no encumbrance recognizable as of this
  87
[1]date. There is nothing that says that is a state route
[2]or anything else. It's just a commonly used travelway.
[3]Q So as far as you know, they could put a
[4]fence up that stops people from traveling on that road?
[5]A Well, that's a different opinion, and I
[6]don't know about that.
[7]Q All right.
[8]A What I appraised was the fee simple
[9]interest, and I recognized that the roadbed existed in
[10]the preexisting condition as well. So it had no effect
[11]on my opinion of damages of $ 94,000.
[12]Q But what you really also recognize is that
[13]it is not -- they do not have a fee simple interest,
[14]correct?
[15]A I disagree with you.
[16]Q It says here, "Fee simple interest is the
[17]absolute ownership unencumbered by any other interest
[18]or estate, subject only to the limitations imposed by
[19]the government powers of taxation." The road is not
[20]taxation, right?
[21]A It's not.
  88
[1]Q Eminent domain. The road is not eminent
[2]domain?
[3]A Hasn't been taken yet.
[4]Q Police power?
[5]A There is -- there is no police power that
[6]I'm aware of under the zoning that I confirmed.
[7]Q Escheat or however you say that word?
[8]A Escheat.
[9]Q Escheat. It's not subject to that, right?
[10]A No. Nobody has terminated their estate
[11]without a will.
[12]Q Okay. And so -- but there is a public
[13]right-of-way going across almost all of that one-tenth
[14]of an acre, correct?
[15]A That's correct.
[16]Q When there is a right-of-way -- a public
[17]right-of-way, that is not fee simple ownership, is it?
[18]A If it's a recorded right-of-way that
[19]features some type of easement of record, it could be
[20]recognized as -- that portion could be encumbered fee.
[21]Q Okay. Did you look at their title policy?
[89]
[1]A No.
[2]Q Did they have a title policy?
[3]A I didn't get a title policy. I don't know
[4]whether they have a title policy or not.
[5]Q Do you know whether their title policy
[6]that -- I assume that they have title policy. Maybe
[7]I'm wrong. But do you know whether they had one?
[8]A Well, I already answered the question. I
[9]haven't seen. I don't know whether they have one.
[10]Q Okay. What if their title policy revealed
[11]this particular problem --
[12]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[13]speculation.
[14]Q -- would that impact your opinions?
[15]A When you say "this particular problem," are
[16]you talking about the trespass, the occupancy?
[17]Q The one-tenth --
[18]A Trespass, occupancy?
[19]Q Yes.
[20]A And if their title policy existed? I don't
[21]see how that's a reasonable hypothetical given that
  90
[1]they acquired the property before the alleged trespass.
[2]Q What about if the deed -- ah, screw it.
[3]Forget it. So you recognized that fair market value
[4]for purposes of this appraisal is defined as what a
[5]willing buyer would pay in cash to a willing seller at
[6]the time of the taking, correct?
[7]A That's correct.
[8]Q Okay. But you did not have data using
[9]comparables to determine what a willing buyer would pay
[10]for this with and without, the one-tenth of an acre,
[11]did you?
[12]A I did with. I didn't with out. And I used
[13]the equivalent methodology recognized by the courts and
[14]generally accepted appraisal practices to make that
[15]determination.
[16]Q What do you mean "hypothetical" conditions?
[17]A Hypothetical condition is something that is
[18]known to be false but assumed to be true for purposes
[19]of analysis.
[20]Q What is that here?
[21]A Before condition that assumes no trespass.
[91]
[1]Q Why is that false? I don't understand.
[2]A The April 14th, 2014, at what point -- the
[3]incident before or after the trespass, it's a
[4]hypothetical. I'm conveying to the reader the intended
[5]use for this report that my before value assumes no
[6]occupancy on April 14th, 2014, but that the instance
[7]after the occupancy, the trespass, that is the after
[8]value.
[9]Q All right. Under paragraphs 11, 12 and 13,
[10]you have limited the ability of other people to use
[11]your opinion here, correct? It's only for purposes of
[12]this litigation?
[13]A That's correct.
[14]Q On Page 10, Paragraph Number 2, do you list
[15]Mr. Bell's report?
[16]A Middle -- middle -- middle of the
[17]paragraph. Real Estate Damages, Applied Economics and
[18]Detrimental Condition, second edition.
[19]Q Thank you. You said second edition. I
[20]thought you said there was a third?
[21]A You know what, I believe that's a typo.
[92]
[1]Let me double check for you. Paragraph should read
[2]third edition. I apologize for that.
[3]Q Okay.
[4]A And when I say that paragraph, I'm
[5]specifically referring to Real Estate Damage, Applied
[6]Economics. And where it says "2008," it should say
[7]2015 in parens after that word. I'm not going to mark
[8]this, but just --
[9]Q What peer reviewed appraisal treatises have
[10]you relied upon?
[11]A That goes more to general knowledge. I
[12]didn't cite a specific treatise -- learned treatise.
[13]Q You contacted a title insurance company?
[14]A No.
[15]Q You didn't?
[16]A No.
[17]Q Who did?
[18]A The owner.
[19]Q The owner contacted title insurance
[20]companies?
[21]A Yes, sir.
  93
[1]Q When did that happen?
[2]A Up until the date of the appraisal.
[3]Q Do you know what he asked?
[4]A Sought title insurance after describing the
[5]encroachment at issue.
[6]Q So he calls up somebody and says that there
[7]is an encroachment, could you insure it?
[8]A Calls up, asks what the cost would be for
[9]title policy with the encroachment and whether
[10]insurance would, in fact, be provided and what the cost
[11]of the insurance would be.
[12]Q Did he ever -- do you know whether he asked
[13]can you provide title insurance and just exclude this
[14]issue?
[15]A No. My understanding, that the whole
[16]purpose of the tile insurance would be to get this
[17]special endorsement to insure over what would generally
[18]be an exception under the title policy.
[19]Q What is the PWC Real Estate Investor
[20]Surveys? How did that play into this?
[21]A The return on investment. I talked about
  94
[1]the alternative investments. That's one of the things
[2]you'll see in the economic indicators of PWC Real
[3]Estate Investors, and then the economic indicators,
[4]that is what I pointed you to on the website.
[5]Q The Metropolitan Regional Information
[6]System, is that the multiple listing?
[7]A That's multiple listing, yes.
[8]Q So you looked at that, and that's where you
[9]got the other two -- three properties?
[10]A Six properties.
[11]Q You only listed three?
[12]A There is three improved. There is three
[13]land sales. Total of six.
[14]Q Okay. Now, your opinion also assumes that
[15]there is a claim for a prescriptive easement?
[16]A I'm not sure I understand your question.
[17]I'm aware of the arguments that have been made asking
[18]for a prescriptive easement in lieu of some other
[19]finding by the court, but I'm not assuming any of that.
[20]Q Does that -- does that prescriptive
[21]easement play in your opinion in any way?
  95
[1]A No.
[2]Q When I say the "prescriptive easement," I
[3]say the request for or -- request or denial of a
[4]prescriptive easement doesn't affect your opinion?
[5]A No. It confirms my opinion. I would
[6]believe that the prescriptive easement that was
[7]requested and denied is recognition of the now illegal
[8]occupancy, trespass of the one-tenth of an acre. So it
[9]confirm my opinion based upon the detrimental condition
[10]at issue.
[11]Q So let me ask you this. If this was an
[12]eminent domain situation and your county, or Harford
[13]County, whoever, electrical company, whatever, wanted
[14]to exert eminent domain over that one-tenth of an acre,
[15]and they took that one-tenth of an acre from the
[16]McNultys, is it your opinion that that one-tenth of an
[17]acre would have been valued at the same price as you
[18]are calling for today?
[19]A Well, when you say took it, permanently?
[20]Q Yeah.
[21]A No.
  96
[1]Q How much would it be then? Do you know?
[2]A It would be a different appraisal. I don't
[3]know because I didn't do a permanent taking. I did
[4]temporary taking.
[5]Q Would it be more or less?
[6]A I can't say until I do it. It would
[7]probably be more because I'm only recognizing the
[8]contributory value over a 45-month period. A permanent
[9]taking could confiscate all the rights for eternity.
[10]Q Okay. So what you are saying is that if
[11]they came in and they took that one-tenth of an acre --
[12]let's say they wanted to widen the road, and they took
[13]that one-tenth of an acre to do it, and they used
[14]eminent domain, you are saying that your opinion would
[15]be that more than $ 88,000 would have been lost on their
[16]property -- property value?
[17]A No. Because you are incorporating damages
[18]to the remainder in a taking that wouldn't result in an
[19]encroachment. It's an entirely different appraisal
[20]problem.
[21]Q I understand it is, but isn't it a check
  97
[1]and a balance on your opinions here -- wouldn't -- I
[2]mean, come on. Are you telling me that you would opine
[3]that -- what is -- whatever the math is. $ 88,000 out
[4]of $ 260,000, the property without the taking is worth
[5]260, and they take one-tenth of that property, and they
[6]take it permanently, forever, and they put up some
[7]utility poles, or they put a road there, it's going to
[8]still be -- it's going to be reduced in value by
[9]$ 88,000?
[10]A No. Because in your hypothetical, there
[11]would not be the cloud on title to the remainder, and
[12]therefore, the 88,373 wouldn't attach.
[13]Q Would it be higher or lower than 88,000?
[14]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[15]speculation.
[16]MR. COLLINS: No, it doesn't.
[17]MR. CHANG: Asked and answered.
[18]A I direct you to Page 2, Exhibit 7. The
[19]portion that you are saying would be taken by Harford
[20]County, as I understand your hypothetical, would be
[21]represented in C. And what C represents --
  98
[1]Q Where is that? Let me find that.
[2]A The chart after Exhibit 7 to Farcht 1.
[3]Q I know. I'm looking for it. Okay.
[4]A Okay. So if you see, on the far left, you
[5]see one or two, before and after. Then you see A, B, C
[6]and D. And what you asked me, I believe, and what I'm
[7]trying to answer, if Harford County took C, the value
[8]would be greater than the 923 that I show because
[9]that's just a temporary taking. But the 88,373 in D
[10]would not be part of my answer to your hypothetical
[11]because there would be no encroachment on the remaining
[12]property causing the lack of title insurance. So
[13]it's -- its not a valid comparison relative to an
[14]analogous situation. Hopefully I've answered your
[15]question.
[16]Q It would be more than 923,000, but it would
[17]be far less than 88,000, right?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q So it's -- its more costly, it's more
[20]damage if you do it for 45 months than if you do it
[21]forever?
  99
[1]A No. Because you are not recognizing the --
[2]the damages is attached to remainder, not to the part
[3]taken.
[4]Q I understand. But -- but -- but the total
[5]damage to the whole property is going to be more if you
[6]do it for 45 months rather than for eternity?
[7]A It's going to be more if you do it for 45
[8]months and you create a cloud of title by virtue of the
[9]taking. There would be defeasible title in a Harford
[10]County taking that would not result in a cloud on
[11]title.
[12]Q But you haven't figured out how much that
[13]would be?
[14]A I haven't done that appraisal. I'm
[15]answering your hypothetical to the best of my ability
[16]sitting here today and not violating my professional
[17]standards.
[18]Q Well, don't your professional standards, as
[19]I saw them earlier, also require you to check your math
[20]and make sure that you do it and it -- it makes some
[21]sort of sense?
  100
[1]A I think this makes perfectly good sense,
[2]and I believe --
[3]Q Well, where I'm having a hard time is that
[4]this temporary taking for 45 months is costing whole
[5]lot more than the permanent taking if they widen the
[6]road.
[7]A Well, I think you need to recognize as part
[8]of my solution to the appraisal problem at issue I'm
[9]recognizing the cloud on title. And it seems to me
[10]that that's the element that you are not embracing.
[11]Q You're -- you're assuming 45 months of
[12]cloud on title that doesn't impair their ability to use
[13]their property in any way, their remainder, other than
[14]maybe to sell?
[15]A Well, that's the whole point.
[16]Q No, it's not the whole point because they
[17]got to use in the meantime, right?
[18]A The defined value here that you've read
[19]repeatedly is willing buyer, willing seller, passing of
[20]title. So to say that's not the point I think really
[21]is -- is the point.
  101
[1]Q They could easily have gotten from a title
[2]policy that excluded this one-tenth of an acre, right?
[3]A Well, if they are going to sell their
[4]entire property, it includes that one-tenth of an acre.
[5]Q It just has an exception that says we are
[6]not going to -- we are not going to insure that
[7]one-tenth of an acre?
[8]A Well, then one would not be able to meet
[9]the generally accepted clauses put forth in either
[10]Maryland or Pennsylvania's recommended residential
[11]contract because you are not --
[12]Q Have you ever looked at a title policy?
[13]A Yes, I have.
[14]Q They have exceptions for everything in
[15]there, don't they?
[16]A Depends upon whether they are reasonable
[17]exceptions or special endorsement exceptions. And what
[18]the language in the contract say special endorsement
[19]requirements are voidable under the contract terms.
[20]Q Are you using the concept of stigma?
[21]A No.
  102
[1]Q You mention it on your report on Page 16?
[2]A Can you direct me to where you see that
[3]language, and I'll put --
[4]Q Second paragraph.
[5]A Second paragraph. I'm just -- that's a
[6]footnote. That's a passage from Real Estate Damages.
[7]I'm just doing it verbatim. "There are risks as
[8]perceived by the market. These risks are sometimes
[9]referred to as stigma." But that's not -- the risks
[10]I'm relating to is the risk that you can't sell the
[11]property now because you can't get title insurance.
[12]And I'm also -- further into that paragraph
[13]the risks that I'm recognizing is a temporary risk
[14]because of the finite duration of the 45-month
[15]impairment period.
[16]Q Did you know that the McNultys exercised
[17]dominion and control over this strip of property?
[18]A Well, I don't believe they do because if
[19]that were true they would still have a fence.
[20]Q Well, they weed whacked it. Is that
[21]dominion and control, cutting the grass?
  103
[1]A You mean they took the fence down with a
[2]weed whacker? I don't understand your question.
[3]Q They cut all the grass down on what they
[4]thought was their property.
[5]A Un-huh.
[6]Q Isn't that exercising dominion and control
[7]over it?
[8]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object. This goes
[9]to liability. Instruct the witness not to answer. I'm
[10]instructing you not to answer.
[11]Q So if, in fact, they did exercise dominion
[12]and control, would that affect your opinion?
[13]A It would depend upon the dominion and
[14]control that they exercised, but I would go back to
[15]what I think is an overarching issue is that there was
[16]a fence. The purpose of the fence was to create a
[17]barrier. The fence was removed. I think they are not
[18]exerting a hundred percent dominion and control over
[19]the property at issue, the one-tenth of an acre.
[20]Q How about if they are exerting 50 percent
[21]dominion and control?
  104
[1]A Well, they are not because now the property
[2]serves in part to the benefit of the southern property
[3]owner by virtue of the connection to the driveway which
[4]has been assembled.
[5]Q Connection to the driveway? What are you
[6]talking about?
[7]A In other words, the McNultys' strip has
[8]assembled with the Casero northern property boundary to
[9]create plottage value. The plottage value is the
[10]incremental increase to Casero recognized by the
[11]greater utility of that property without the McNulty
[12]strip.
[13]Without the McNulty strip, they'll be
[14]crossing and gaining access to their property east of
[15]Big Stream Creek. That's -- that roadway stream
[16]crossing for purposes of fire truck purposes is going
[17]to be a six-figure element.
[18]Q I don't understand what you just said.
[19]A Okay.
[20]Q Explain it.
[21]A Take another bite of the apple.
  105
[1]Q Please do.
[2]A They don't -- the McNultys don't exert a
[3]hundred percent dominion and control. They lost the
[4]fence. They also lost the ability to use the property
[5]with the fence because now it's impaired with a
[6]driveway. That driveway benefits --
[7]Q The fence was nowhere near the driveway.
[8]MR. CHANG: Can he finish his answer?
[9]MR. COLLINS: I know.
[10]Q But I want to make sure you understand
[11]that. The fence was nowhere near the driveway?
[12]A If they had a hundred percent dominion and
[13]control, they had the right to put the fence on the
[14]entire strip of property they owned.
[15]Q Okay. All right.
[16]A All right. So they are not exerting a
[17]hundred percent dominion and control because they don't
[18]have that fence, and they could extend the fence. And
[19]now there is a trespass in the form of a driveway. Now
[20]that driveway benefits the southern property owner.
[21]Now, to get legal access from Salt Lake
  106
[1]Drive, that southern property owner needs to go to the
[2]east of Big Stream Creek, which means there is going to
[3]be a creek crossing to access the improvement. That
[4]creek crossing is for purposes of allowing the fire
[5]truck; otherwise, the southern property owner couldn't
[6]maintain their insurance policy, and they would have to
[7]advise their carrier of an adverse condition, change in
[8]their policy. And that's going to be potentially a
[9]six-figure cost item to legal access from Salt Lake
[10]Road for the southern property owner.
[11]Q To the Caseros?
[12]A Yeah.
[13]Q I got it. The McNultys can extort the
[14]Caseros --
[15]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[16]Q -- for that cost? Is that what you are
[17]suggesting?
[18]MR. CHANG: Objection.
[19]A I don't think it's an extortion at all. I
[20]think it's a recognition that the Caseros avoided that
[21]cost by trespassing and occupying the McNultys'
  107
[1]property.
[2]Q But we already saw that the prior land
[3]owner had access to that Salt Lake Road all along for a
[4]hundred years. Do you agree with that?
[5]MR. CHANG: Objection. Objection.
[6]A Not in the location.
[7]Q But on the west side of that stream?
[8]MR. CHANG: I'm going to object.
[9]Q Right?
[10]MR. CHANG: That does go -- again go into
[11]liability, and I'm going to instruct the witness not to
[12]answer.
[13]Q Do you not -- do you know that or not?
[14]MR. CHANG: I'm instructing the witness not
[15]to answer.
[16]MR. COLLINS: All right. We'll take a
[17]break.
[18](A recess was taken.)
[19]Q How important is it to your opinion that
[20]McNultys are unable to obtain title insurance without a
[21]special exclusion?
  108
[1]A Well, that's not the entirety of the
[2]concern. The concern would be there would be a special
[3]endorsement requirement and then what the cost of that
[4]premium if one could find an insurer who would insure
[5]over that exception, what it would be.
[6]Q So what does -- how does it impact your
[7]opinion?
[8]A Well, right now there is no availability of
[9]title insurance even with a premium for the special
[10]endorsement.
[11]Q So how do it affect your opinion?
[12]A It recognizes the impairment. It confirms
[13]the impairment.
[14]Q So putting aside title insurance, does
[15]your -- the impact on title insurance, does that --
[16]does your opinion change?
[17]A I don't understand your question.
[18]Q Putting aside this issue that you've
[19]identified regarding insurance --
[20]A Uh-huh.
[21]Q -- does that change -- just take that out
  109
[1]of the equation. Does your opinion regarding the
[2]values change?
[3]A That would be a different appraisal.
[4]Q So you don't know?
[5]A I do know, but that would be a different
[6]appraisal. And what you would have to do is define the
[7]appraisal you want me to consider it under.
[8]Q So you don't know the answer to my
[9]question.
[10]A I believe I answered your question.
[11]Q I would like a yes or a no. Would it
[12]affect your opinion if you take out this whole issue
[13]about title insurance? Yes or no?
[14]A Under your hypothetical, yes.
[15]Q Okay. Would it go up or down?
[16]A Depends upon the rest of the appraisal
[17]problem you are asking me to hypothetically consider.
[18]Q Okay. In your opinion, normally
[19]remediation is considered as part of one of these
[20]temporary conditions, right?
[21]A It's considered.
  110
[1]Q Did you consider it?
[2]A Well, the remediation in this case would be
[3]if there was availability of title insurance to
[4]insurance over the special exception, and what the
[5]premium would be, that would be the cost of
[6]remediation.
[7]Q Was it considered in your opinion?
[8]A Yes. And it was also the physical
[9]remediation. In other words, to reinstall the fence
[10]and to remove the driveway.
[11]Q You've got to remove the driveway,
[12]reinstall a similar fence?
[13]A The fence.
[14]Q And then clear the title issue?
[15]A And clear the title, yes.
[16]Q And that would be --
[17]A -- all forms of remediation, and you would
[18]have to remove the trespass.
[19]Q Well, that's -- that does it, right?
[20]A I'm not sure.
[21]Q What do you mean?
  111
[1]A Well, as I said, that area has been
[2]integrated to the yard of the southern property owner
[3]with the no trespassing sign. If you remove all those
[4]criteria, I think, yes, the four corners of the
[5]remediation would be fulfilled.
[6]Q So -- so if the court ordered them to not
[7]use that one-tenth of an acre -- ordered the Caseros
[8]not to use the one-tenth of an acre, ordered them to
[9]take down the no trespassing sign, allowed the McNultys
[10]to put up a comparable fence, and told the Caseros to
[11]take the asphalt off of the McNulty land --
[12]A Uh-huh.
[13]Q -- and restore it to grade or whatever --
[14]A Uh-huh.
[15]Q -- is there anything else that would need
[16]to be done to remediate the problem?
[17]A Just make sure there was no remaining
[18]clouded encroachment of record that could possibly
[19]impair title -- the availability of title insurance.
[20]Q I mean if the court ordered that they owned
[21]the one-tenth of the land, that would do that, right?
  112
[1]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[2]speculation.
[3]A I'm not sure that it would do it in its
[4]entirety. I'm just saying to fully remediate, you
[5]would have to remove any cloud of title.
[6]Q How do you do that?
[7]MR. CHANG: Objection. Calls for
[8]speculation.
[9]A Sue the quiet title.
[10]Q That's what this is, right?
[11]A In part.
[12]Q Okay. So if a federal judge issued an
[13]order that ordered that McNultys own that one-tenth of
[14]the land, that would -- one-tenth of an acre, that
[15]would remove the cloud on title, correct?
[16]A I believe so.
[17]Q It would also effectively move the
[18]Mason-Dixon line, right?
[19]A That, I'm not qualified to answer. I'm not
[20]an engineer.
[21]Q So is it your opinion that the McNultys had
  113
[1]the right to put a fence in from the corner of their
[2]property all the way down to the other corner of their
[3]property?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q What do you base that on?
[6]A The fact is that was identified to me by a
[7]qualified licensed surveyor as the property owned by
[8]the McNultys, and that they would have the ability to
[9]put a fence just like they had previously on the
[10]entirety of the property they owned.
[11]Q And so if that were not true, that would
[12]impact your opinion, correct?
[13]A It would depend upon why it's not true and
[14]what the effect of untruth was on my opinion.
[15]Q Well, it's one of the assumptions of your
[16]opinion, correct?
[17]A What is?
[18]Q That they had a right to put a fence all
[19]the way down.
[20]A It's my opinion that they had the right to
[21]put a fence on the property they owned.
  114
[1]Q And that's one of your assumptions.
[2]A When you say "all the way down," I'm not
[3]sitting here telling you exactly where the corner is.
[4]I'm just saying for the portion of the property that
[5]the McNultys own that is bounded by Casero/Hattenburg
[6]property, they had a right to put a fence in.
[7]Q Okay. That's one of the assumptions of
[8]your opinion, correct?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Okay. Let me turn to Exhibit 6 of your
[11]report?
[12]A Yes, sir.
[13]Q What is the significance of this?
[14]A In order to value the components of the
[15]property, being land and improvements, and then the
[16]portion occupied and remainder, you have to look at the
[17]total property value and then the land value separately
[18]to get those four elements. And this is the land
[19]value.
[20]Q Why do you get -- why do you get the land
[21]value separate from --
  115
[1]A It's a different physical component. And
[2]in order to --
[3]Q So is the whole property worth 260, plus
[4]160?
[5]A No. 260. Of which the allocation of the
[6]value of 260 is 160 to the land and 100 to the
[7]improvements. Total of 260.
[8]Q Okay. And from this, you were also able to
[9]opine that the value per acre in that area is
[10]approximately $ 27,000 per acre?
[11]A Yes, sir.
[12]Q And is that comparable elsewhere? I think
[13]what you are looking at here is one is 29, one is 23
[14]and one is 24. Is that about right?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Okay. Does the use of the property make a
[17]difference when it comes to the value of land in that
[18]area?
[19]A These are residential uses comparable to
[20]the subject. So, I mean, you could theoretically have
[21]an agricultural use or a conservation use that has a
  116
[1]different value.
[2]Q Is that usually higher or lower?
[3]A It would depend upon what the utilization
[4]was. A conservation use is generally going to be lower
[5]unless you carve out a building location as part of the
[6]conservation easement.
[7]Q Do you know whether the McNultys' property
[8]was subject to a conservation easement?
[9]A According to Fawn Grove township, it was
[10]not.
[11]Q How about an agricultural use?
[12]A Well, it's in an agricultural conservation
[13]zoned district, but it's -- one of the permitted uses
[14]is single-family-detached residences. So it's fully
[15]compliant with zoning.
[16]Q At one point the prior owners got paid
[17]something to zone it agricultural. Is that the same
[18]thing we are talking about?
[19]A I mean it wasn't the prior owners. It was
[20]the township. In other words, they adopt the zoning
[21]ordinance.
  117
[1]Q I'm talking about something different.
[2]A Okay.
[3](Harvey Exhibit 5 was marked for purposes
[4]of identification.)
[5]A Yes, sir.
[6]Q Isn't this a document indicating that the
[7]homeowner, the Bates, the prior owner, had agreed that
[8]they would not use the property -- that they are
[9]getting money --
[10]A They are getting a reduction in their
[11]assessment based upon land use, but that reduction is
[12]voided when it changes title. It's no longer in force
[13]or effect.
[14]MR. COLLINS: Okay. I have nothing
[15]further.
