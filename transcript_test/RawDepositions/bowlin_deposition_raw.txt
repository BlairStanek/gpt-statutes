[13]EXAMINATION
[14]BY MR. [*4]  JOHNSON:
[15]Q. All right. Good morning, Dr. Bowlin. My
[16]name is Willie Johnson. I am here, along with
[17]Ms. Riley, on behalf of the Plaintiff, Ms. Janice
[18]Beard, who is also one of your patients.
[19]Doctor, please state your full name and
[20]business address for the record, please.
[21]A. Timothy Charles Bowlin, M.D., Baton Rouge
[22]Orthopaedic Clinic, 8080 Bluebonnet Boulevard, Suite
[23]1000, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70810.
[24]Q. Dr. Bowlin, what kind of doctor, are you?
[25]A. I'm an orthopaedic hand surgeon.
Page 7
[1]Q. Can you explain for the jury what that
[2]involves?
[3]A. Orthopaedics is the treatment of bones and
[4]joints, and I specialize in hands, wrists and elbows.
[5]Q. Outstanding. Doctor, you've provided us
[6]with your C.V., your curriculum vitae. Some of the
[7]jurors might understand it to be a resume.
[8]A. Okay.
[9]Q. You've provided that to us. Is this current
[10]and up to date, Dr. Bowlin?
[11]A. It is. The only thing that needs to be
[12]added to this is a certificate of added qualification
[13]in surgery of the hand.
[14]MR. JOHNSON: Doctor, we will attach
[15]your [*5]  C.V. for the jury's review as Bowlin
[16]No. 1 -- subject to any objection?
[17]MS. GONZALES: There are none.
[18](Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.)
[19]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[20]Q. Doctor, how long have you been a surgeon?
[21]A. I -- I finished my residency in 2008,
[22]finished my fellowship in 2009. I've been here since
[23]August of 2009 in private practice at the Baton Rouge
[24]Orthopaedic Clinic.
[25]Q. If you could, just very briefly explain for
Page 8
[1]the jury, what you do day to day.
[2]A. I see patients, diagnose them with hand and
[3]upper extremity problems, treat them either with or
[4]without surgery.
[5]MR. JOHNSON: Doctor, at this time,
[6]I would like to tender you as an expert
[7]in the field of orthopaedic medicine --
[8]do you have a specialty in hand surgery?
[9]THE WITNESS: Correct.
[10]MR. JOHNSON: -- with a specialty in
[11]hand surgery -- subject to any objection?
[12]MS. GONZALES: None.
[13]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[14]Q. Doctor, I understand that you have treated
[15]Ms. Janice Beard here at the clinic, Baton Rouge
[16]Orthopaedic Clinic, is that correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18] [*6]  Q. According to the records I have, you began
[19]treating Ms. Beard on January 14, 2015; is that
[20]correct?
[21]A. That's correct.
[22]Q. Doctor, can you explain for the jury how you
[23]came to meet Ms. Beard? Did she find you, was she
[24]referred to you; can you explain that to the jury?
[25]A. I believe she was referred to me by my
Page 9
[1]partner, Nick Hatzis. He had taken care of a shoulder
[2]problem she had, and she was complaining of hand
[3]dysfunction and he sent her to see me.
[4]Q. Doctor, if you can, take a look at your
[5]chart notes. And is there any indication in your note
[6]there as to what records or information you had
[7]available by the first visit of January 14, 2015?
[8]A. I had Dr. Hatzis' notes:
[9]Q. And could you please provide the jury with
[10]Ms. Beard's complaints to you at that time? What were
[11]her problems?
[12]A. Her complaint to me was left small finger
[13]pain and stiffness.
[14]Q. And, Doctor, in your note, there is an area
[15]that is entitled History.
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. Can you explain for the jury what a history
[18]is?
[19]A. The information that is provided [*7]  by the
[20]patient pertaining to the reason that they see a
[21]physician.
[22]Q. Doctor, could you please provide Us with the
[23]history that Ms. Beard provided to you on that date?
[24]A. She explained to me that she was a
[25]55-year-old right-hand dominant woman who works for
Page 10
[1]the city council in Hammond, Louisiana, and also a
[2]volunteer tax preparer. She stated that she was
[3]arrested by the Sheriff's Department on February 22nd,
[4]2013, and it sound like she had a small finger injury
[5]and right shoulder injury.
[6]She subsequently had surgery by Dr. Gerald
[7]Peterson on March 7th, 2013, where she explained that
[8]he pinned her small finger. Then on July 16th, 2013,
[9]she reported that he removed a pin in the operating
[10]room. She described the complaint as being stiff ever
[11]since the injury and surgery. She had had hand
[12]therapy at North Oaks in Hammond and hadn't gotten any
[13]better.
[14]Her primarily complaint the day that I saw
[15]her was inability to flex her finger but also some
[16]mild pain, and she said that she had seen Dr. Hatzis
[17]for her shoulder as well as someone else for her neck
[18]problems. [*8] 
[19]Q. Doctor, did you have an opportunity to
[20]review any records from her previous treatment
[21]performed by Dr. Peterson?
[22]A. Not that I'm aware of.
[23]Q. Okay. Doctor, in this History, she explains
[24]that Dr. Peterson pinned her left small finger on
[25]March 7, 2013; is that correct?
Page 11
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. Can you explain for the jury what it means
[3]to pin? What does that mean when it says, "Her left
[4]finger was pinned"?
[5]A. Well, without the ability to see x-rays and
[6]before the injury and after the surgery, I would have
[7]to assume that she had a broken finger, one of the
[8]bones in the finger was broken and he set that -- that
[9]fracture, and then stabilized it with a pin.
[10]MS. GONZALES: I'm going to have to
[11]object to the extent that his testimony
[12]is not based on sufficient facts or
[13]information. He said he did not review
[14]Dr. Peterson's records and his treatment
[15]of the Plaintiff.
[16]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[17]Q. And we're just reading the -- this is the
[18]history that was provided to you, correct, Doctor?
[19]A. That's correct.
[20]Q. All right. And, Doctor -- to [*9]  address
[21]Ms. Amy's objections, they're perfectly understandable
[22]-- why is a history important to the treatment of a
[23]patient?
[24]A. They explain etiology or cause of the --
[25]their complaint; what pertains to the complaint, what
Page 12
[1]complaint -- what makes it better, what makes it
[2]worse; why they're having a complaint, is it painful,
[3]is it dysfunction? And then some type of historical
[4]background that might pertain to the relevance of the
[5]complaint.
[6]Q. So the history is important to you as a
[7]doctor?
[8]A. It's very important.
[9]Q. All right. So the information that she
[10]provides, by way of Dr. Peterson's previous surgeries,
[11]was that important to you?
[12]A. It is.
[13]Q. All right. Doctor, now, it goes on to say
[14]that on July 16, 2013, he did, Dr. Peterson did a pin
[15]removal, is that what your History says?
[16]A. Yes, sir.
[17]Q. What is a pin removal? Explain that for the
[18]jury.
[19]A. Well, sometimes the hardware or metal that
[20]we put in in people's bodies to fix fractures,
[21]sometimes it becomes painful, sometimes it fails and
[22]it requires to be removed. [*10]  Sometimes it's a planned,
[23]staged situation where we know we're going to have to
[24]go in and take it out and we wait for the bone to heal
[25]and then take it out, and sometimes just due to
Page 13
[1]patient's complaints or the hardware can fail.
[2]Q. Okay. So, Doctor, did you conduct a
[3]physical examination of Ms. Beard at this time?
[4]A. I did.
[5]Q. And can you tell the jury what the results
[6]of that examination were?
[7]A. I examined her left upper extremity and
[8]noted that she had small finger stiffness at the PIP
[9]joint, which is the middle joint of the finger, And
[10]she had significant loss of mobility there from
[11]lacking 25 degrees from full extension, so she
[12]couldn't straighten out the finger all the way, and
[13]she could only flex it to 45 degrees at this joint.
[14]So instead of flexing it all the way, she could only
[15]flex it approximately 45 degrees. So she had a range
[16]of motion of roughly 20 degrees at that joint.
[17]Q. Doctor, is it fair to say in your expert
[18]medical opinion that at that time would you consider
[19]her finger to be usable?
[20]A. It's usable but it's quite dysfunctional. [*11] 
[21]Q. What do you mean by "dysfunctional," Doctor,
[22]for the jury?
[23]A. Sure. Well, in my opinion, the small finger
[24]is the second most important digit in the hand, minus
[25]the thumb, which is the most important. And the
Page 14
[1]reason that it's extremely important, the small finger
[2]that is, is because in order to have any grip
[3]strength, it requires the small finger tip to be into
[4]the palm. If you lack 45 degrees of flexion, you
[5]can't bend it or flex it anymore than this
[6](indicating), and that serves two -- two problems:
[7]One is the lack of ability to make a tight fist, which
[8]decreases grip strength, and the second is that it
[9]often gets stuck on things. You go to put it in your
[10]pocket, it's getting stuck. It sticks out and it's --
[11]it's a problem.
[12]Q. Okay. Doctor, did you review any x-rays or
[13]MRIs at this time?
[14]A. I took some x-rays --
[15]Q. Okay.
[16]A. -- of her finger. AP lateral and oblique
[17]view or three fingers of that finger, and I noted
[18]there were some mild arthritic changes in that joint,
[19]the PIP joint that was affected.
[20]Q. Now, Doctor, at this time [*12]  what were your
[21]impressions or diagnoses?
[22]A. Left small finger stiffness after the PIP --
[23]of the PIP joint, and that she had had surgery on that
[24]finger before.
[25]Q. What is the PIP? What does that stand for?
Page 15
[1]A. Proximal interphalangeal joint. So, distal
[2]interphalangeal joint, proximal interphalangeal joint.
[3]Q. So would that be the knuckle, the middle
[4]knuckle?
[5]A. It's the middle knuckle of the small finger.
[6]Q. Middle knuckle of the small finger. All
[7]right And, Doctor, what was your plan -- what was
[8]your game plan at that point?
[9]A. Well, I asked her if this was something that
[10]she could tolerate. She stated that she was having
[11]difficulty living this way, and she really wanted to
[12]do anything possible to try and improve her function
[13]and decrease the pain. I just explained to her that
[14]there was a surgical option. Since she had tried hand
[15]therapy, it had had been so long since the previous
[16]surgery that it really wasn't going to get any better
[17]on its own and that surgery was appropriate in my
[18]opinion; and that would be a PIP capsulectomy, which
[19]is [*13]  that middle knuckle where we go in and we open up
[20]the joint capsule which is scarred down in these
[21]situations, we release that, as well as an extensor,
[22]which means the ability to straighten the finger out.
[23]Tenolysis which is -- there is scar tissue between the
[24]skin and underlying bone of the extensor mechanism
[25]which prevents her from straightening it out, so we
Page 16
[1]free up that scar tissue along the tendons and in the
[2]joint itself.
[3]Q. Okay. So, Doctor, what -- what was your
[4]next -- your next date that you saw Ms. Beard?
[5]A. I believe I operated on her.
[6]Q. According to my records, January 21st, 2015?
[7]A. I believe that's correct. Yes,
[8]January 21st, 2015, which is one week after I
[9]initially met her.
[10]Q. So, Doctor, can you explain for the jury
[11]what you did in the surgery?
[12]A. Just what I explained. We brought her to
[13]the operating room. We provided her with some
[14]anesthesia, numbed her linger, and then made an
[15]incision along the dorsum or the top of the finger
[16]over the PIP joint. We freed the scar tissue along
[17]the extensor mechanism as well as did a capsulectomy, [*14] 
[18]which is where we release the joint capsule itself,
[19]and then release the ligaments that stabilize that
[20]joint which were scarred down as well.
[21]Q. Now, Doctor, this surgery -- so the jury
[22]understands, this was performed in a hospital?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. What hospital was it performed?
[25]A. Surgical Specialty Center of Baton Rouge.
Page 17
[1]Q. All right. And was Ms. Beard placed under
[2]general anesthesia?
[3]A. No, sir.
[4]Q. Okay. She was placed under local
[5]anesthesia?
[6]A. She was placed under, what we call, MAC
[7]anesthesia, which is sedation --
[8]Q. Okay.
[9]A. -- and then local.
[10]Q. Okay. And how long did the surgery take
[11]place, Doctor?
[12]A. I don't know the exact time but I would say
[13]it was approximately 30 minutes or less.
[14]Q. Okay. Now, was Ms. Beard conscious? Was
[15]she able to see what Was occurring? Explain that.
[16]A. She couldn't see because we keep a drape
[17]over her to provide -- to maintain sterility during
[18]the procedure.
[19]Q. Yes.
[20]A. But I did have them wake her up after we
[21]started because, once I did [*15]  the release of the joint
[22]and the tendons, I like to have patients actively or
[23]under their own power see how much flexibility we have
[24]gained that way we know, basically, that is probably
[25]as good as it's going to get --
Page 18
[1]Q. Yes, sir.
[2]A. -- and we know what a reasonable expectation
[3]is in the future.
[4]Q. So, Doctor, after the surgery, explain to us
[5]how you determined whether your goals had been met.
[6]Did you fix the problem?
[7]A. We made it better.
[8]Q Made it better. Explain to the jury what
[9]you mean by "better."
[10]A. We provided -- she was able to obtain more
[11]range of motion after the surgery than she had before
[12]the surgery.
[13]Q. So now I know we had that -- that deficit in
[14]terms of flexing.
[15]A. Yes, sir.
[16]Q. Can you hold your finger up and, if you
[17]remember, explain for the jury how far the finger
[18]extended after the surgery?
[19]A. That I don't know. Based on my operative
[20]report, I did talk about gaining 30 more degrees of
[21]flexion, so probably instead of tight like this
[22](indicating), it was probably about like this in the
[23]operating [*16]  room (indicating) --
[24]Q. Okay.
[25]A. -- but I did not document how much extension
Page 19
[1]was there.
[2]Q. Extension. Okay. Doctor, now, after the
[3]surgery -- did you prescribe any medication for
[4]Ms. Beard following the surgery for pain or
[5]inflammation or otherwise?
[6]A. Yes, sir.
[7]Q. Can you explain for the jury what
[8]medications you prescribed?
[9]A. I don't know what I prescribed but I always
[10]prescribe some type of narcotic medication as long as
[11]the patient can take it. And we do that obviously for
[12]their comfort, but we start the patient -- and for
[13]this type of procedure -- the next day with hand
[14]therapy, and so it's very important that they have
[15]adequate pain control so they can work through the
[16]pain and hopefully prevent or minimize the scarring
[17]that wants to occur after the surgery.
[18]Q. Doctor, where did Ms. Beard obtain or
[19]undergo hand therapy?
[20]A. Let's see. At the Physical Hand -- Physical
[21]Therapy and Hand Center in our Livingston office.
[22]Q. And, Doctor, can you tell us based on your
[23]notes there, do you know how many times she underwent
[24] [*17]  hand therapy?
[25]A. I don't know.
Page 20
[1]Q. Okay. So let's move on to your next visit
[2]Doctor, with her and, according to my records, that
[3]was February 3rd, 2015?
[4]A. That's correct.
[5]Q. Doctor, at that time, can you tell us what
[6]Ms. Beard reported to you?
[7]A. She was doing better. She had more mobility
[8]with extension and flexion. She had no complaints
[9]other than it hurt, otherwise, she was getting better.
[10]Q. And did you conduct a physical examination
[11]of the finger?
[12]A. I did.
[13]Q. And what were your results?
[14]A. The wound had healed. There were no signs
[15]of infection, and her range of motion had improved but
[16]I did not measure the exact amount.
[17]Q. Okay. And you also removed the stitches --
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. -- on that day?
[20]A. Yes, sir.
[21]Q. Okay. Doctor, I also notice that in your
[22]Impression you have "Two weeks status-post surgery as
[23]above," and what was your plan at that time?
[24]A. We removed the stiches. Continue the
[25]therapy. I gave her another prescription for
Page 21
[1]Percocet, which was the pain medicine [*18]  that we had
[2]provided for her, and we were to see her back in a
[3]month.
[4]Q. And, Doctor, when was the next time you saw
[5]Ms. Beard?
[6]A. March 6th, 2015.
[7]Q. And what did she report at that visit?
[8]MS. GONZALES: I'm going to object
[9]to the extent that these records have not
[10]been produced in accordance with a court
[11]order.
[12]MR. JOHNSON: Yeah, we don't have
[13]them either.
[14]MS. GONZALES: Okay.
[15]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[16]Q. And, Doctor, we have a note here that you
[17]have March 6th, 2015. We do not have that note, the
[18]updated record.
[19]A. Oh, okay.
[20]Q. Our records stop at February 3rd, 2015.
[21]A. Oh, okay.
[22]Q. But we'll circulate that note.
[23]A. You're happy to have it after I'm done
[24]reading it.
[25]Q. Absolutely. Doctor, what did the patient
Page 22
[1]report at that time on March 6th, 2015?
[2]A. She stated that she was doing better.
[3]Unfortunately, it was cold at that time and she said
[4]that it was hurting. And she brought in some -- some
[5]compounding prescription that Dr. Peterson had
[6]provided for her previously, and said she was [*19]  running
[7]out, it had helped and wanted to know if I could
[8]provide her with another prescription. Overall, she
[9]stated she was very happy with the improvement that
[10]she had made.
[11]Q. Okay. Did you conduct a physical
[12]examination at that time?
[13]A. I did.
[14]Q. And what were the results of that
[15]examination?
[16]A. Improving range of motion but it was stiff
[17]that day, again, she related that as more of an
[18]anomaly due to the cold weather. Swelling was
[19]improving and she had a well-healed incision.
[20]Q. That's good. So were you pleased at this
[21]point --
[22]A. Yes
[23]Q. -- overall? Okay. And was she still
[24]undergoing therapy?
[25]A. She was.
Page 23
[1]Q. Okay. Do you have those records, Doctor,
[2]the therapy records?
[3]A. I only have one record of therapy, but it --
[4]I don't have the exact dates that she went, but -- I
[5]can tell you that I'm not sure she was going to
[6]therapy but I wanted her to be going to therapy.
[7]Q. Excellent. But as far as you know, she was
[8]compliant, she was doing as you ordered her to do?
[9]A. I assumed.
[10]Q. And, Doctor, [*20]  when was the next time you saw
[11]Ms. Beard?
[12]A. April 17th, 2015.
[13]Q. And what did she tell you at that visit;
[14]what was her report?
[15]MS. GONZALES: I'm just going to
[16]have the same objection regarding our
[17]production.
[18]MR. JOHNSON: I understand.
[19]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[20]Q. And same response, Doctor, we don't have any
[21]records --
[22]A. Yes, sir.
[23]Q. -- passed February 3rd, 2015 to address
[24]counsel's objection.
[25]A. Okay. She stated the change in the weather
Page 24
[1]would make it hurt. She had some stiffness but
[2]overall she was better.
[3]Q. So, Doctor, at this point, as of April 17,
[4]2015, what is your understanding as to what's causing
[5]this -- the patient's stiffness?
[6]A. Well, there's -- I'm sure it's
[7]multifactorial: She had a fracture, she had surgery,
[8]she had -- and then she had some arthritis in her
[9]joints as well.
[10]Q. Okay. And, Doctor, did you conduct a
[11]physical examination at this time?
[12]A. I did.
[13]Q. And what were the results of that exam?
[14]A. She had full extension which is the ability
[15]to straighten her finger [*21]  out all the way, and she
[16]lacked 30 degrees of flexion.
[17]Q. So show the jury what that means when you
[18]say, "She lacked 30 degrees aflexion."
[19]A. Roughly that. (Indicating.)
[20]Q. All right. And what about extension?
[21]A. Full extension.
[22]Q. Full extension. All right. So you're
[23]pleased overall that she --
[24]A. It's an improvement.
[25]Q. Okay.
Page 25
[1]A. Yes, sir.
[2]Q. But it was Still painful based on her
[3]reports?
[4]A. Due to the weather change, yes, sir.
[5]Q. Okay. Doctor, when did you see -- or what
[6]was your plan at this point as of April 17, 2015?
[7]A. Well, at that point, we basically decided
[8]there was nothing else surgically that can be done to
[9]alleviate any stiffness, and that we would just give
[10]it time to see how things progressed and that I would
[11]see her as needed.
[12]Q. Okay. So, as of April 17, 2015, you have
[13]not seen Ms. Beard?
[14]A. That's correct.
[15]Q. And you have not discharged her yet?
[16]A. Well, I have.
[17]Q. Okay.
[18]A. When I say I'm going to see people as
[19]needed, it's basically -- I mean, [*22]  they're welcome to
[20]back if they need but, no, we don't have a plan to
[21]continue care at this time.
[22]Q. Excellent. Did you provide her with any
[23]prescriptions at that time?
[24]A. I did not.
[25]Q. All right. So, Doctor, if she experiences
Page 26
[1]pain, what is her -- what would you expect for her to
[2]do?
[3]A. I would expect her to use some heat,
[4]antiinflammatories, and Tylenol.
[5]Q. Now, those antiinflammatories, are those
[6]prescription antiinflammatories or something over the
[7]counter?
[8]A. Either over the counter or, if that's not
[9]acceptable or doesn't work, then provide a
[10]prescription.
[11]Q. Give the jury examples of antiinflammatories
[12]that are purchased over the counter at your local
[13]Walgreens.
[14]A. Ibuprofen such as Advil, and then Naproxen
[15]such as Aleve.
[16]Q. Okay. Doctors are you familiar with the
[17]term "prognosis"?
[18]A. Yes, sir.
[19]Q. As of today, what is the prognosis for
[20]Ms. Beard -- well, I'm sorry. What does prognosis
[21]mean?
[22]A. Prognosis is basically an expectation of
[23]what's to come.
[24]Q. And what is your expectation [*23]  for Ms. Beard
[25]in this left pinky finger?
Page 27
[1]A. I think that she is going to have permanent
[2]stiffness in that finger, and I think she'll have
[3]occasional pain, and I believe that the arthritis will
[4]eventually progress.
[5]Q. Doctor, I know We began this deposition with
[6]an explanation about usability of the finger and I
[7]think you used the term functional or dysfunctional.
[8]Can you explain for the jury whether the finger is
[9]functional or -- explain the functionality of the
[10]finger as of today.
[11]A. Well, I think -- based on my last
[12]documentation of her lack of motion, I think that it's
[13]probably functional but there's obviously some
[14]dysfunction because she can't make a tight fist;
[15]however, function and dysfunction is subjective
[16]because some patients are able to overcome more
[17]significant limitations than others, so I think that's
[18]really a per patient determination.
[19]Q. Doctor, I noted in my preparation for today,
[20]your note of January 14, 2015, if you could, go to
[21]that note, page two.
[22]A. (Complies.)
[23]Q. That was the first day you saw her?
[24]A. Yes, sir. [*24] 
[25]Q. And on the second page of the note, you
Page 28
[1]stated that her finger, quote, "will never be normal."
[2]A. That's correct.
[3]Q. Can you explain to the jury what you mean by
[4]that statement: "It will never be normal"?
[5]A. Well, the chances of having -- With the
[6]condition that she came in with as long as it had been
[7]going on and everything that pertained to her
[8]condition, in my opinion and experience, our goal is
[9]normality, but it's very seldom reached with this type
[10]of problem and with the subsequent treatment and
[11]surgery. So I like for patients to have realistic
[12]expectations and so I am very honest with them with
[13]what to expect. If a miracle happens and it's normal,
[14]fantastic, but the likelihood of that happening is
[15]small.
[16]Q. Okay. And, Doctor, as of the last time you
[17]saw Ms. Beard and following the surgery that you
[18]performed, which appears to be a success, is this
[19]your position that the finger will never be
[20]normal?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. All right. And that is for the remainder of
[23]her life?
[24]A. That's correct.
[25]Q. All right. Doctor, are [*25]  you familiar with
Page 29
[1]the term "Maximum medical improvement"?
[2]A. I am.
[3]Q. Explain what that means to the jury, please.
[4]A. We use that term most often with workers'
[5]compensation claims to determine -- when we state a
[6]patient met maximum medical improvement, it means that
[7]we don't believe that any further treatment is going
[8]to make a significant improvement in the patient's
[9]outcome.
[10]Q. And in Ms. Beard's case, has -- does she
[11]qualify for that definition at this time?
[12]A. I believe so.
[13]Q. All, right. So as far as the left pinky
[14]finger, based on your experience and in your medical
[15]opinion, she has reached maximum medical improvement?
[16]A. Yes, sir.
[17]Q. All right. Doctor, based on your knowledge
[18]of this patient and the treatment that you provided,
[19]is it your opinion that, more probably than not, that
[20]this injury to the left pinky finger and the treatment
[21]you provided came as a result of the arrest incident
[22]with the Tangipahoa Sheriff's Office that she reported
[23]to you on January 14, 2015?
[24]MS. GONZALES: I'm going to object
[25]because it assumes [*26]  facts not in evidence.
Page 30
[1]Calls for speculation.
[2]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[3]Q. Go ahead, Doctor.
[4]A. I would agree it's speculation because
[5]without me seeing her before the injury and
[6]specifically what the injury looked like at the time
[7]with x-rays, then I -- I can't say how much of an
[8]underlying condition she had in the joint as far as
[9]arthritic change, but I -- I can state that when
[10]patients have this surgery that Dr. Peterson did,
[11]people often, get stiff.
[12]Q. And, Doctor, based on your January 14, 2015,
[13]note, what did Ms. Beard report to you as the reason
[14]for her finger injury?
[15]A. That she was -- she had been arrested and
[16]her small finger -- her left small finger and right
[17]shoulder were injured during that arrest.
[18]Q. Assuming that to be true, assuming that she
[19]never -- that her left finger were normal prior to the
[20]arrest incident and then it was injured, following the
[21]arrest incident, which has a date of February 22nd,
[22]2013 -- assuming that to be true, are you able to
[23]render an opinion as to the cause of her finger
[24]injury?
[25]MS. GONZALES: Same objection. [*27] 
Page 31
[1]THE WITNESS: If her finger were
[2]perfectly normal, prior to the arrest --
[3]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[4]Q. Yes.
[5]A. -- and the injury, then I would say that
[6]there is a direct cause and effect from the injury and
[7]surgery that would cause her stiffness.
[8]Q. From the arrest?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. Great.
[11]MR. JOHNSON: And, Counsel, since
[12]this is a trial deposition, would you
[13]like to state the basis of your objection
[14]previously?
[15]MS. GONZALES: The basis of my
[16]previous objection was it assumes facts
[17]not in evidence. There's no detail about
[18]the arrest or the mechanism of injury.
[19]He's already stated that she had
[20]preexisting injury or arthritis to her
[21]finger which would impact his
[22]decision-making.
[23]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[24]Q. And, Doctor, with that objection, assume for
[25]me -- first, do you have any records of Ms. Beard's
Page 32
[1]finger condition, the left finger condition prior to
[2]February 22nd, 2013?
[3]A. I do not.
[4]Q. Okay. Assume for me that Ms. Beard did not
[5]have a broken finger prior to February 22nd, 2013 --
[6]A. Okay.
[7] [*28]  Q. -- and then after February 22nd, 2013, when
[8]she reports an arrest by the Sheriff's Office, that
[9]she stained a broken finger. Assuming that to be true
[10]and based on what you know through today, is it your
[11]opinion that, more likely than not -- your medical
[12]opinion more likely than not to a degree of reasonable
[13]certainty -- that this injury to the left pinky finger
[14]came as a result of the arrest that she reports in
[15]your January 14, 2015, note?
[16]MS. GONZALES: I'm going to object
[17]to the form. What injury are you
[18]speaking of?
[19]MR. JOHNSON: Her broken left
[20]finger.
[21]MS. GONZALES: The break to the
[22]finger?
[23]MR. JOHNSON: Yes.
[24]MS. GONZALES: Okay.
[25]THE WITNESS: Yes.
Page 33
[1]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[2]Q. All right. Doctor, the other question I
[3]have for you is are you familiar with the term,
[4]"Impairment rating"?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. What is impairment rating?
[7]A. Impairment rating is based on the AMA's
[8]guide. The American Medical Association provides a
[9]guide of impairment that we use. It's a reference
[10]manual that we use to determine how much impairment, [*29] 
[11]based in my -- in my business, from a finger to the
[12]whole body. So if there's damage, such as an
[13]amputation or permanent stiffness to a finger, there's
[14]a guide, tables that we use that we base those
[15]numbers. We look at the numbers -- the objective data
[16]that we find, the measurements in this case, and then
[17]we would refer to tables. And then that provides a
[18]hand impairment rating, an upper extremity rating, and
[19]then that correlates to a whole person impairment
[20]rating.
[21]Q. Doctor, are you able to provide for the jury
[22]an impairment rating for Ms. Beard's finger, her left
[23]finger with respect to the whole body?
[24]A. If I had the manual, I could, but I don't
[25]have it.
Page 34
[1]Q. In your experience in handling these kinds
[2]of surgeries and patients, can you give the jury some
[3]general range of what a -- what an impairment rating
[4]would be for the left finger with respect to the whole
[5]body?
[6]A. For lacking 30 degrees of motion, it's very
[7]small. Very small.
[8]Q. What would --
[9]A. Less than 5 percent.
[10]Q. Less than 5 percent. Okay.
[11]A. Quite possibility [*30]  less than 3 percent of the
[12]whole person impairment rating based on this.
[13]Q. And then with respect to the finger itself
[14]what would be the impairment?
[15]A. I wouldn't -- it would be a pure guess.
[16]Q. Well what would that guess be?
[17]MS. GONZALES: I've got to object as
[18]calling for speculation. He's already
[19]said he doesn't have the foundation for
[20]that testimony.
[21]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[22]Q. In your experience with dealing with similar
[23]patients.
[24]A. So what was your question again?
[25]Q. What would the impairment rating be with
Page 35
[1]respect to the finger itself?
[2]MS. GONZALES: Same objection.
[3]THE WITNESS: Okay. The finger
[4]itself, which is not really a finger but
[5]a hand --
[6]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[7]Q. Yes.
[8]A. -- is how you would do that, I would say
[9]probably less than 10 percent.
[10]Q. Doctor, now, the record that you have in
[11]front of you, does that constitute your entire record
[12]that you have --
[13]A. Yes, sir.
[14]Q. -- used today in connection with your
[15]testimony?
[16]A. Yes, sir.
[17]MR. JOHNSON: I would like to attach
[18] [*31]  the entirety of that chart as Bowlin
[19]No. 2. Subject to any objection?
[20]MS. GONZALES: Just the objection of
[21]production.
[22](Exhibit 2 was marked for identification.)
[23]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[24]Q. Doctor, how much do you charge to testify?
[25]I know you have a busy patient load. What is your
Page 36
[1]charge to provide testimony for this jury today?
[2]A. Honestly I don't know.
[3]Q. Okay. We will defer to your bookkeeping
[4]department, if that would be fine?
[5]A. Okay.
[6]MR. JOHNSON: And we'll attach the
[7]invoice to verify the amount that you've
[8]charged today for your testimony as
[9]Bowlin No. 3. Any objection?
[10]MS. GONZALES: I haven't seen it so
[11]I can't object but, assuming it's the
[12]true and correct copy of the invoice for
[13]his services provided today, I wouldn't
[14]object to that.
[15]MR. JOHNSON: Outstanding.
[16](Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.)
[17]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[18]Q. Doctor, I believe -- Doctor, and last thing
[19]is the expenses that Ms. Beard would have paid for
[20]your care and treatment and surgery, are those
[21]contained in your chart as well?
[22] [*32]  A. No, sir.
[23]Q. All right. Where would those be contained
[24]in?
[25]A. Our billing department.
Page 37
[1]Q. And part of our records here that were
[2]obtained by Subpoena provided by my colleague,
[3]Ms. Gonzales, contains some of the bills. We'd like
[4]to get a printout of those bills today, and that
[5]should form a part of your record, as well.
[6]MR. JOHNSON: Subject to any
[7]objection, that's I believe Bowlin No. 2?
[8]MS. GONZALES: (No audible
[9]response.)
[10]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[11]Q. Yes, all right. And Dr. Bowlin, I thank you
[12]for your time.
[13]A. Thank you.
[14]MS. GONZALES: I need to go off the
[15]record for a second.
[16]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're going off
[17]the record at 7:40. We are now off
[18](Break taken.)
[19]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on
[20]the record. The time is 7:44.
[21]EXAMINATION
[22]BY MS. GONZALES:
[23]Q. Dr. Bowlin, my name is Amy Gonzales, and I'm
[24]the attorney for the Defendants in this matter. Have
[25]we met previously?
Page 38
[1]A. Have we met?
[2]Q. Yes.
[3]A. I don't believe.
[4]Q. Okay. Have you met with Mr. Johnson before? [*33] 
[5]A. No.
[6]Q. Okay. What percentage of your cases are
[7]litigated matters?
[8]A. Oh, I have no idea.
[9]Q. Would you say less than half?
[10]A. Oh, absolutely.
[11]Q. Less than 25 percent?
[12]A. Less than 5 percent
[13]Q. There we go. Okay. Did you always
[14]personally treat Mrs. Beard, or did you have P.A.s or
[15]some other assistants?
[16]A. Well, I have a P.A., however, I'm the only
[17]person that saw her in my office and treated her. He
[18]might have seen her but I saw her every time.
[19]Q. Very good. Now, Doctor, I have within the
[20]records that was previously produced responsive to my
[21]subpoena, an Advance Beneficiary Notice of Non
[22]Coverage that concerns occupational therapy. This may
[23]be within your notes, but I'll pass it to you for --
[24]A. I doubt it.
[25]Q. -- convenience. And, Doctor, it mentions
Page 39
[1]that was a request for occupational therapy but
[2]there's been a box that's been selected which is
[3]Option D. Do you see that?
[4]A. I see Option 3.
[5]Q. Maybe it's Option 3. It's the last option.
[6]A. Yes, ma'am.
[7]Q. What does that state? [*34] 
[8]A. "I don't want the occupational therapy
[9]listed above. I understand with this choice I am not
[10]responsible for payment and I cannot appeal to see if
[11]Medicare will pay."
[12]Q. Okay. And is that signed?
[13]A. It is.
[14]Q. Does the signature appear to be that of
[15]Janice Beard or at least --
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. -- that's what the words say is "Janice
[18]Beard"?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. And is there a date next to that?
[21]A. January 22nd, 2015.
[22]Q. Would that correlate to the occupational
[23]therapy that you had recommended after your --
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. -- January 21st, surgery?
Page 40
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. Based on that, does that impact your opinion
[3]as to whether or not she had physical therapy or
[4]occupational therapy after your surgery?
[5]A. It states there that she didn't want it, but
[6]let me look and see in my therapy notes, the date of
[7]the therapy form that I have. It just states what we
[8]wanted to do. She was seen on January 22nd, 2015, so
[9]I have to assume that she didn't go back.
[10]Q. Okay. Why did you say that hand therapy was
[11]so important [*35]  post your January 21st surgery?
[12]A. Hand therapy is exceedingly important in
[13]hand surgery because the hand is a highly complex
[14]machine. And, especially the type of surgery that we
[15]did for her, that -- anytime you operate on a finger
[16]or a finger is injured, scar tissue wants to develop,
[17]and that was the reason we took her to the operating
[18]in the first place was to try to reduce and excise the
[19]scar issue and improve the mobility. And our
[20]experience and research has proven that if he don't
[21]initiate hand therapy very quickly after this type of
[22]surgery, that the body will just start scarring in its
[23]normal response to healing.
[24]Q. Would that affect range of motion as well?
[25]A. Correct.
Page 41
[1]Q. How so?
[2]A. If we don't get the finger moving properly,
[3]you significantly reduce the -- the positive benefits
[4]of the surgery.
[5]Q. So because -- like you said, it allows scar
[6]tissue to form that would --
[7]A. Lack of motion, correct.
[8]Q. So the failure to have occupational therapy
[9]would decrease the benefit of the surgery that you
[10]perform; is that correct, Doctor? [*36] 
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. Okay. Now, in your Operative Report of
[13]January 21st, you noted significant improvement; is
[14]that correct?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. Okay. Did Mrs. Beard tell you, after her
[17]January 21st, 2015, surgery, whether or not her finger
[18]condition kept her from performing any particular
[19]activity?
[20]A. Not that I documented.
[21]Q. Okay. Would you expect her to have any
[22]significant limitations from her finger as it existed
[23]on your last visit in April 2015?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. And what significant limitation would that
Page 42
[1]be?
[2]A. The inability to make a tight fist.
[3]Q. Okay.
[4]A. And also there would be -- if the finger is
[5]sticking out -- essentially for lack of a better
[6]medical explanation -- you can't get it out of the way
[7]when you -- if she goes to straighten her hand out,
[8]the finger is going to be bent. I'm sorry. If she
[9]goes to make a fist, her finger is not going to be all
[10]the way down so it could get caught in pockets and
[11]shirts and things like that, caught on tables, et
[12]cetera.
[13]Q. And did Mrs. Beard report to you of any
[14] [*37]  problems with having her finger getting caught on
[15]items?
[16]A. I did not document any specific complaint.
[17]Q. Okay. Now, when you had mentioned that she
[18]had had a great increase -- and I think you said that
[19]she had had a perfect amount of flexion; is that
[20]correct?
[21]A. No. Extension.
[22]Q. Extension.
[23]A. Normal extension but lacked 30 degrees of
[24]flexion at the last visit.
[25]Q. Would that lack of 30 degrees -- could that
Page 43
[1]be attributable to her failure to participate in
[2]occupational therapy in any way?
[3]A. Possibly.
[4]Q. Can you give an opinion as to the percentage
[5]of the extent of that?
[6]A. It would be speculation, but the reason we
[7]order the hand therapy is to give the best potential
[8]outcome after the surgery. And if it's a fact that
[9]she did not get any hand therapy, then I would state
[10]that her lack of full flexion could be contributed to
[11]not obtaining hand therapy.
[12]Q. Okay. And when you put your patients in
[13]occupational therapy, is there a usual duration or --
[14]how long do you expect them to participate in therapy?
[15]A. Four [*38]  to six weeks for most things such as
[16]this.
[17]Q. And your file does not reflect that she
[18]participated in that, does it, Doctor?
[19]A. Just one visit.
[20]Q. Okay. Have you restricted her activities?
[21]A. I have not.
[22]MS. GONZALES: I have no further
[23]questions, Doctor.
[24]MR. JOHNSON: Doctor, just one
[25]follow-up.
Page 44
[1]You've heard some questions from the
[2]Defendants' attorney. Does any
[3]information that you've just shared with
[4]the jury, does that effect your opinion
[5]as to the cause of Ms. Beard's broken
[6]finger?
[7]THE WITNESS: No.
[8]MR. JOHNSON: Okay. And, Doctor,
[9]once again, based on what we know, what
[10]was the cause of her broken finger?
[11]THE WITNESS: She stated --
[12]MS. GONZALES: I'm going to object.
[13]It's based on speculation; he's already
[14]stated that. It's been asked and
[15]answered a number of times.
[16]BY MR. JOHNSON:
[17]Q. I'm sorry. Doctor, based on your records,
[18]what was the cause of her broken finger?
[19]MS. GONZALES: Same objection.
[20]THE WITNESS: The arrest on
[21]2/22/2013.
[22]MS. GONZALES: That's all I have. [*39] 
[23]Thank you, Doctor.
[24]MR. JOHNSON: Thank you.
[25]THE WITNESS: Thank you.
