[1]EXAMINATION
[2]BY MS. ROSS:
[3]Q. Good morning, Dr. Smith.
[4]A. Good morning.
[5]Q. My name is Emma Ross, and I represent
[6]Monsanto in this case. It's nice to meet you.
[7]A. Nice to meet you.
[8]Q. Do you understand that this is my
[9]opportunity to ask you questions about your opinions,
[10]the bases for those opinions, and you as it relates to
[11]this case?
[12]A. I do.
[13]Q. You've been deposed before, so we won't
[14]spend a whole lot of time on ground rules, if that's
[15]all right with you.
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. At some point today, I'm sure I will ask
[18]a question that's unclear or uses a term
[19]inappropriately or mispronounces something. So if
[20]you'd ask me to stop and repeat or rephrase the
[21]question, I'd be happy to do that. Okay?
[22]A. Okay.
[23]Q. If you answer my question, I will assume
[24]you've understood it. Is that fair?
[25]A. Fair.
  Page 8
[1]Q. Is there any reason you cannot give
[2]complete and accurate testimony today?
[3]A. Not that I know of.
[4]Q. Have you talked to anyone other than
[5]Plaintiffs' counsel about this case?
[6]A. No.
[7]Q. I'm going to ask just a few more
[8]specific questions to make sure it doesn't bring up
[9]something that you might not have been thinking of.
[10]Okay?
[11]A. Okay.
[12]Q. You have never spoken with Mr. Chapman,
[13]correct?
[14]A. I have not.
[15]Q. You have not examined Mr. Chapman,
[16]correct?
[17]A. I have not.
[18]Q. You are not his treating physician,
[19]correct?
[20]A. I am not.
[21]Q. Have you ever spoken with any of
[22]Mr. Chapman's treating physicians?
[23]A. I have not.
[24]Q. Do you know Peter McLaughlin?
[25]A. No.
  Page 9
[1]Q. Have you ever spoken with
[2]Dr. Weisenburger?
[3]A. No.
[4]Q. Have you ever spoken with Dr. Sawyer?
[5]A. No.
[6]Q. Have you ever spoken with any other
[7]expert for the Plaintiffs in the Roundup litigation?
[8]A. I have not.
[9]Q. I handed you Exhibits 1 and 2 to your
[10]deposition, and I just want to identify them for the
[11]record. Exhibit 1 is your invoice in this case,
[12]correct?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. You can set that aside for now.
[15]Exhibit 2 is your expert report regarding Otis
[16]Chapman, correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. You wrote a report in this case, right?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Your report sets out all the opinions
[21]you will offer at trial, correct?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. Is there anything in your report that
[24]needs to be corrected as you sit here today?
[25]A. It's always a possibility that I would
  Page 10
[1]entertain, but I feel I reviewed it pretty carefully.
[2]If there's -- if there's issues, I'm happy to discuss
[3]them.
[4]Q. But nothing came up when you were
[5]rereviewing your report or preparing for this
[6]deposition that sitting here you think we need to
[7]correct at this point?
[8]A. Nothing jumped out, no.
[9]Q. You have a reference list at the end of
[10]your report. I think it begins on Page 9, but let me
[11]verify that that's true. Yes.
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. There are 31 references on your list at
[14]the end of your report. Do you see that?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. You also reviewed Mr. Chapman's medical
[17]records, right?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. You reviewed his deposition, correct?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. Is there anything else that you're
[22]relying on besides these 31 references, Mr. Chapman's
[23]deposition, and his medical records for your opinions
[24]in this case?
[25]A. Yes. The general causation reports, I
  Page 11
[1]found very helpful, and then I reviewed Dr. Wong's
[2]deposition, I reviewed Dr. Portier's update, his 2021
[3]update to his prior general causation opinion.
[4]Q. Anything else?
[5]A. I cannot recall. I tried to list them
[6]in this report. Those, I think, were the main ones.
[7]Q. And when you say the general causation
[8]reports, I think the ones that you list in your report
[9]are Dr. Ritz, Dr. Weisenburger, and Dr. Portier. Does
[10]that sound right to you?
[11]A. Yes. Sorry. I also read a report by
[12]Dr. Sawyer, who I believe is a toxicologist.
[13]Q. Do you remember if that report was about
[14]Mr. Chapman in particular or about Roundup in general?
[15]A. That was about Mr. Chapman. There were
[16]a lot of general elements to it, but about Mr. Chapman
[17]around -- particularly around his exposure, and then
[18]there was quite a bit of information around the
[19]toxicology and other elements of glyphosate.
[20]Q. I want to break that down just a little
[21]bit. All right?
[22]A. Sure.
[23]Q. You reviewed Dr. Sawyer's report about
[24]Otis Chapman, correct?
[25]A. Correct.
  Page 12
[1]Q. When did you review his report? Had you
[2]already completed yours?
[3]A. No. It was probably somewhere in the
[4]middle.
[5]Q. So you reviewed Dr. Sawyer's report
[6]before you completed your opinions in this case,
[7]right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. Are you relying on Dr. Sawyer's report
[10]for any of your opinions about Mr. Chapman?
[11]MR. DIAMOND: Form. You can go ahead
[12]and answer.
[13]MS. ROSS: That's a poor question, so
[14]let me go ahead and say it again.
[15]MR. DIAMOND: It wasn't a horrible
[16]question, but I just wanted to make sure.
[17]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) New question. Are you
[18]relying on Dr. Sawyer's report in any way for the
[19]opinions you are offering about Otis Chapman?
[20]MR. DIAMOND: Same, form. Go ahead.
[21]A. The main element of his report that I
[22]actually relied on was the validation of Mr. Chapman's
[23]report of his exposure history.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) When you say "validation
[25]of Mr. Chapman's report of his exposure history," what
  Page 13
[1]do you mean?
[2]A. My understanding from Mr. Diamond is
[3]that Mr. Sawyer spoke directly to Mr. Chapman and went
[4]through point by point his exposure, which lined up a
[5]lot with -- almost totally consistently with the
[6]amended -- what is it called, PFS?
[7]MR. DIAMOND: Yes.
[8]A. -- PFS. Sorry. I don't know my lawyer
[9]terms very well.
[10]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) That's all right.
[11]A. The amended PFS, which outlined his
[12]exposure history.
[13]Q. So are you relying on Mr. Chapman's
[14]sworn testimony about his Roundup use, what
[15]Mr. Chapman told Dr. Sawyer about his Roundup use, or
[16]both of those things for your opinions in this case?
[17]A. All of the above. And that actually
[18]prompts me to remember, I also read his deposition,
[19]Mr. Chapman's deposition, and that contributed to that
[20]as well.
[21]Q. I think we had that on the list, but I'm
[22]glad we clarified. Okay?
[23]A. Yes. So I would say all three of those;
[24]PFS, Mr. Chapman's deposition, and Mr. Sawyer -- or
[25]Dr. Sawyer's summary, which I had understood was
  Page 14
[1]personally validated with Mr. Chapman.
[2]Q. Now, when you say "personally
[3]validated," did Dr. Sawyer, to your knowledge, ever
[4]see Mr. Chapman spray Roundup?
[5]A. No, what I mean by that is that my
[6]understanding is that he spoke with Mr. Chapman and
[7]went point by point through his history of exposure.
[8]Q. Right. So you are -- new question. You
[9]are relying on what Otis Chapman told Dr. Sawyer in
[10]his interview, correct?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. And that's for your opinions about
[13]Mr. Chapman's exposure history to Roundup, right?
[14]A. Again, there were three different
[15]sources that I tried to align. Those were the PFS --
[16]the amended PFS, Dr. Sawyer's report, and then
[17]Mr. Chapman's deposition.
[18]Q. And this is not a trick question. I
[19]just want to make sure we have the list. So new
[20]question. Okay? For your opinions about
[21]Mr. Chapman's exposure history, you are relying on his
[22]PFS, his sworn deposition testimony, and what he told
[23]Dr. Sawyer in an interview, correct?
[24]A. Correct, with one technical difference.
[25]I believe what I saw was the amended PFS.
  Page 15
[1]Q. Okay.
[2]A. Again, I am not an expert in the
[3]elements of how those PFSs are collected, but I
[4]believe that's what it was called when I saw it.
[5]Q. And as we spoke about a minute ago,
[6]you've never spoken with Mr. Chapman, right?
[7]A. I have not.
[8]Q. You have no independent knowledge of his
[9]spraying of Roundup, correct?
[10]A. Correct. That's why it was important
[11]for me to try to align these reports and make sure
[12]they were consistent.
[13]Q. And as far as you recall Mr. Chapman's
[14]reports, between his amended PFS, what he told
[15]Dr. Sawyer, and what he said in his deposition, are
[16]consistent?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. Is there -- withdrawn. Are you relying
[19]on Dr. Sawyer's report for anything else?
[20]A. I cannot tell you how much that
[21]influences my thinking. This was -- again, if I were
[22]to rank the reports and how they impacted me, I would
[23]say Dr. Portier's general causation report is most
[24]impactful for me, plus just the body of references
[25]that I reviewed. Those are probably the two main
  Page 16
[1]ones.
[2]Q. Dr. Portier's report is the most
[3]impactful for you with regard to general causation; is
[4]that right?
[5]A. I think so, and plus his amended report.
[6]Q. And just to be clear, you're not relying
[7]on any exposure calculations or information from
[8]Dr. Sawyer on how much glyphosate Mr. Chapman may have
[9]had in his body at any time, correct?
[10]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[11]A. Yeah, I'm not sure I understand that.
[12]Beyond -- I am relying on the extent and the type of
[13]exposure that he had and the amount of time, the lag
[14]time, that he had that exposure before he developed
[15]lymphoma.
[16]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) You're relying on what
[17]Dr. Sawyer says about how long Mr. Chapman used
[18]Roundup and how often he uses Roundup, right?
[19]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[20]A. Again, because it's aligned with the two
[21]other sources of information. So I felt like I had
[22]three somewhat independent sources of information that
[23]said the same thing.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) If there were differences
[25]between Mr. Chapman's amended PFS, his deposition
  Page 17
[1]testimony, and Dr. Sawyer's report, would that
[2]influence your opinions in this case in any way?
[3]A. I think it depends on how significant
[4]they are. I mean, I think people have trouble
[5]remembering back decades, so it wouldn't surprise me
[6]if there were minor differences, but if there were
[7]big, major differences, like, you know, somebody
[8]reported 16 years of exposure before lymphoma and
[9]another person reported 5, that would be significant,
[10]and I would want to get to the bottom of that.
[11]Q. It's difficult to remember what you did
[12]in 1987; is that fair?
[13]A. That is fair.
[14]Q. I want to see if we agree about some
[15]basics of Mr. Chapman before we get into the details
[16]of his medical history. Okay?
[17]A. Sure.
[18]Q. Mr. Chapman first presented with an
[19]enlarging lymph node in 2002, right?
[20]A. Let me check.
[21]Q. If it helps you, it's in your report on
[22]Page 2.
[23]A. Thanks. That is correct.
[24]Q. Let me reask the question since we had a
[25]little back and forth there. Okay?
  Page 18
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. Mr. Chapman first presented with an
[3]enlarging lymph node in 2002, correct?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. He was diagnosed with small lymphocytic
[6]lymphoma, or SLL, in 2003, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Is it all right with you if today I use
[9]the abbreviation to talk about small lymphocytic
[10]lymphoma?
[11]A. Please do.
[12]Q. We'll both know what we're talking
[13]about, right?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Mr. Chapman was treated for his SLL in
[16]2003, correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. He was treated with six cycles of RFMD
[19]immunochemotherapy in 2003, right?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. Mr. Chapman has received no treatment
[22]for SLL since 2003; right?
[23]A. That is my understanding.
[24]Q. It is 2021 as we're sitting here, right?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 19
[1]Q. Mr. Chapman has received no treatment
[2]for SLL in the last 18 years, correct?
[3]A. That is my understanding.
[4]Q. Mr. Chapman is in complete remission
[5]from his SLL, right?
[6]A. That is not my understanding. The
[7]information I have is sparse, but my understanding is
[8]that he relapsed in 2009 and has been what's called
[9]watch and wait since then.
[10]Q. I want to make sure I just understand
[11]what your opinion is on this before we go further.
[12]Okay?
[13]A. Right.
[14]Q. How would you describe Mr. Chapman's
[15]current status with regard to his lymphoma? Would you
[16]say it is a partial remission, a clinical remission?
[17]How would you describe it?
[18]A. So my understanding is that he had a --
[19]what is termed a relapse in 2009, so the lymphoma came
[20]back. It was documented as coming back, but because
[21]it was localized and not causing him symptoms, it was,
[22]I think between Mr. Chapman and his physician, elected
[23]to do what is called watch and wait, which is an
[24]approach to these type of indolent lymphomas like SLL.
[25]Q. That was in 2009, right?
  Page 20
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. 12 years ago, right?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. Do you know if Mr. Chapman ever had any
[5]follow-up diagnostic imaging that showed resolution of
[6]lymphopathy after that?
[7]A. I have not seen any records to that
[8]effect.
[9]Q. If there are those records, you'd agree
[10]he's in remission at this point, correct?
[11]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[12]A. Right. It depends on the imaging.
[13]Imaging can be tricky. It's not necessarily
[14]completely black or white, so I'd have to see those,
[15]but if they were completely normal, then it's
[16]feasible. Sometimes lymph nodes come back, and then
[17]they do spontaneously remit, so that's within the
[18]realm of feasibility.
[19]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) It's within the realm of
[20]feasibility that with SLL in particular, which is an
[21]indolent lymphoma, one can have lymph nodes that
[22]become clinically apparent and then remit over time;
[23]is that what you said?
[24]A. That's possible. Again, this is pure
[25]speculation because I really don't have any of his
  Page 21
[1]records since 2009.
[2]Q. Do you recall when the last time
[3]Mr. Chapman saw oncology for his SLL was?
[4]A. I don't know. The last records that
[5]I've seen -- again, I did query Mr. Diamond about
[6]this, but the last records I've seen that I know
[7]anything specific are from 2009, the ones in my
[8]report.
[9]Q. As far as you know, Mr. Chapman has not
[10]seen an oncologist for his SLL since 2009, correct?
[11]A. I believe -- I thought he was seeing an
[12]oncologist on an ongoing basis, but I do not know the
[13]frequency or what the results of those tests are. The
[14]last records that I have had access to were from 2009.
[15]Q. So the most recent records you have
[16]about Mr. Chapman's SLL course are from 2009, right?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. You can't say anything about --
[19]A. I can't.
[20]Q. -- what specifically has happened to
[21]Mr. Chapman with regard to SLL since 2009, fair?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]MR. DIAMOND: Emma, just for the record,
[24]I provided everything that was downloaded by both
[25]defense and Plaintiffs that we had at the time. If
  Page 22
[1]there's new things that have come in and I've not sent
[2]it to Dr. Smith, it's probably my fault, and I'll do
[3]so.
[4]MS. ROSS: Thanks, David.
[5]MR. DIAMOND: Okay.
[6]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Just to wrap this up, and
[7]then I think we can move on. Okay?
[8]A. Sure.
[9]Q. In your report, middle of Page 2, you
[10]say there was a biopsy on June 17th, '19 of a right
[11]neck lymph node. I think that should be June 17th,
[12]2009; is that right?
[13]A. 2009, correct. Sorry. That is an
[14]error.
[15]Q. And then you state a bone marrow biopsy
[16]on June 26th, 2009 was negative for CLL or lymphoma.
[17]Do you see where I am?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. And then you say he has reportedly been
[20]followed since that time without additional treatment,
[21]right?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. And that's what we were just talking
[24]about in terms of Mr. Chapman's lymphoma history over
[25]the last 12 years. He has reportedly been followed
  Page 23
[1]without treatment, fair?
[2]A. That's my understanding.
[3]Q. On Page 2 of your report, a little
[4]further up, where you begin speaking about
[5]Mr. Chapman's history of present illness -- do you see
[6]where I am?
[7]A. At the very start where it says History
[8]of Present Illness?
[9]Q. Correct.
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. You state Mr. Chapman had no B symptoms.
[12]Do you see that?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. When he first presented, Mr. Chapman had
[15]no symptoms from SLL, right?
[16]A. Well, he noticed the enlarging lymph
[17]nodes. B symptoms refer to things like fever and
[18]weight loss and night sweats, and my understanding is
[19]he did not.
[20]Q. Apart from an enlarging supraclavicular
[21]lymph node, Mr. Chapman had no symptoms of his SLL
[22]when he initially presented, true?
[23]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[24]A. I don't know that I can say that. B
[25]symptoms are specifically asked for. They're part of
  Page 24
[1]staging prognosis, et cetera. Those were specifically
[2]mentioned that he did not have them. I can't tell you
[3]if he had other things like fatigue. There are many
[4]symptoms that he may have had that were not noted.
[5]All I can say is my read of the report was he
[6]specifically did not have the lymphoma-related B
[7]symptoms.
[8]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Do you recall that
[9]Mr. Chapman's cancer was discovered incidentally
[10]during an annual exam?
[11]A. I do not. My understanding of, again,
[12]both the -- I thought his reports and the reports I
[13]read is that he noticed an enlarging lymph node and
[14]then brought that to the attention of his physicians.
[15](Deposition Exhibit 3 was marked.)
[16]Q. Dr. Smith, I'm handing you Exhibit 3 to
[17]your deposition. Actually, you should have the copy
[18]with the exhibit number, so hand that copy to your
[19]counsel.
[20]A. This looks like doctor's handwriting.
[21]Q. It does. Dr. Smith, you have Exhibit 3
[22]to your deposition in front of you. Do you see this
[23]is a note from February 18th, 2003?
[24]A. Oh, yes, at the top, it says that.
[25]Sorry. At the bottom, it says February 17th.
  Page 25
[1]Q. That's fair. Sometime in February 2003,
[2]correct?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. And this is a handwritten note, which
[5]thankfully we don't really do anymore, right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. The first sentence or two, are you able
[8]to read what those say?
[9]A. Part of it.
[10]Q. It looks to me like "Lindell Chapman, a
[11]57-year-old white male, presented to my office on
[12]12/20/02 for his annual physical exam and blood draw.
[13]Of note, an approximately 15 millimeter
[14]supraclavicular node was palpated above the medial
[15]aspect of his right clavicle."
[16]Does that look right to you?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. You have no reason to disagree that
[19]Mr. Chapman's SLL was found incidentally at an annual
[20]exam in late 2002, correct?
[21]A. That would not be consistent with the
[22]other records that said he noticed it earlier in 2002
[23]and that there were -- by my understanding by dates,
[24]it reports actually that he had an MRI done prior to
[25]that and the lymph node biopsy that was done almost at
  Page 26
[1]the same time, so the next day. So hard for me to
[2]tell whether this was noted incidentally. That would
[3]not be consistent by what I read in the other records.
[4]Q. And when you Say what you read in the
[5]other records, what specifically are you referring to?
[6]A. The records that I was provided from
[7]Mr. Chapman's other physician visits and doctor
[8]visits. I thought there was both procedures and that
[9]he had noticed this swollen lymph node prior to that.
[10]Q. Apart from swollen lymph nodes, do you
[11]recall Mr. Chapman ever having any symptoms from his
[12]SLL?
[13]A. I do not recall other symptoms being
[14]reported, no.
[15]Q. In your report, same page, you say --
[16]A. I'm sorry. Are we done with this?
[17]Q. We are. You can set that aside.
[18]In your report, you talk about
[19]Mr. Chapman's bone marrow biopsies in a few places.
[20]A. Okay.
[21]Q. You talk about his initial bone marrow
[22]biopsy, which was negative for involvement, right?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. Then he had a follow-up bone marrow
[25]biopsy in March of 2004 that was negative for lymphoma
  Page 27
[1]as well, right?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. He had another bone marrow biopsy in
[4]June of 2009 that was negative for lymphoma
[5]involvement, correct?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. Mr. Chapman has no peripheral blood or
[8]bone marrow biopsy involvement with his SLL ever,
[9]right?
[10]A. That's my understanding.
[11]Q. Do you consider CLL and SLL to be the
[12]same disease or different diseases?
[13]A. It's a bit semantics. Their biology and
[14]their treatment is very similar. They're typically
[15]lumped together in just about every study, every
[16]treatment recommendation. The main distinction is CLL
[17]involves the blood and the bone marrow, and SLL
[18]typically involves lymph nodes or tissue outside the
[19]lymph node and does not involve the blood or the bone
[20]marrow. So clearly there's some -- there must be some
[21]difference between the two on how they behave, but
[22]they're -- for all intents and purposes, for practical
[23]purposes, they typically get lumped together.
[24]Q. That was what I thought you were saying
[25]in your report, but I just wanted to make sure that we
  Page 28
[1]were clear on it. Okay?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. So CLL and SLL for all intents and
[4]purposes related to evaluating data are considered the
[5]same disease, correct?
[6]A. They are.
[7]Q. And there may be -- in fact, probably
[8]must be -- some difference on some level that causes
[9]CLL to present primarily in the blood and bone marrow
[10]and SLL to present primarily in lymph nodes, right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. When he was diagnosed and treated for
[13]SLL in late 2002 and early 2003, is there any doubt in
[14]your mind that Mr. Chapman knew he had cancer?
[15]A. No.
[16]Q. I think you say in your report that the
[17]average survival for SLL is about 10 years. Do you
[18]remember that?
[19]A. I do. That is -- SLL and CLL has a huge
[20]range of survival. So there's an average, but that
[21]really doesn't do justices because there are people --
[22]I think I said this in my report -- there are people
[23]that can live decades with this, and there are people
[24]that can live a couple years with it. So that number
[25]is not overly helpful. It just gives you a sense that
  Page 29
[1]there are some people that can live longer, longer
[2]periods of time with that than many other cancers that
[3]we deal with.
[4]Q. I see. To break that up a little bit
[5]because that was a little bit of a long answer.
[6]A. Sorry.
[7]Q. No, you're fine. Mr. Chapman is 18
[8]years out from his treatment for SLL, right?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. His survival is, thankfully, well above
[11]the average for SLL?
[12]A. It is above the average, but there are
[13]definitely people that live this long with SLL and
[14]CLL.
[15]Q. That is true because you can have a
[16]highly variable course with SLL or CLL. In some
[17]cases, it may relapse quickly with significant
[18]symptoms, right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. And in some cases, it may transform to a
[21]more aggressive form of lymphoma, correct?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. There is no evidence of transformation
[24]in Mr. Chapman's case, correct?
[25]A. Not that I'm aware of.
  Page 30
[1]Q. Mr. Chapman does not currently need any
[2]treatment of any kind for his SLL, right?
[3]A. Again, the most recent information I
[4]have from him is probably his deposition. So what I
[5]have is information from querying Mr. Diamond about
[6]that, reading his deposition. The last records that I
[7]had to review, again, were those in 2009.
[8]Q. Okay. So as -- again, just so we have a
[9]clear record on this, you don't have any records of
[10]his treatment since 2009, as you've said, correct?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. So for -- withdrawn. As far as you
[13]know, based on the information that is available to
[14]you, Mr. Chapman does not currently need any treatment
[15]of any kind for his SLL; is that fair?
[16]A. I don't know about the word "need." I
[17]simply don't know. My understanding is that he has
[18]not had any treatment. That's as far as I know.
[19]Q. Let me ask it this way. Have you seen
[20]anything in the records or materials that have been
[21]provided to you that would lead you to conclude that
[22]Mr. Chapman currently needs treatment for his SLL?
[23]A. With the limited records and information
[24]I have, I do not see anything that says he needs
[25]treatment, but, again, I feel somewhat compromised in
  Page 31
[1]that statement because I just simply don't have
[2]current medical records on him. I've -- again, I
[3]queried Mr. Diamond about that, and I read
[4]Mr. Chapman's deposition; and from those, I did not --
[5]I did not find anything, but I'd certainly feel a lot
[6]more comfortable in that statement if I had current
[7]medical records, if there was any specific information
[8]that an oncologist had seen him recently and said he
[9]was in remission or he was totally stable, those kind
[10]of things.
[11]Q. All fair, and what I'm trying to do
[12]right now is just make sure that you are not going to
[13]come to trial and tell us that Mr. Chapman -- that
[14]based on the information that you've reviewed,
[15]Mr. Chapman needs immediate treatment and a bone
[16]marrow transplant for his SLL. All right?
[17]A. Right.
[18]Q. So let me reask my question just in
[19]terms of the opinions that you plan to offer in this
[20]case. Is that fair?
[21]A. Sure.
[22]Q. Okay. New question. You are not
[23]offering the opinion in this case that Mr. Chapman
[24]currently needs treatment for his SLL, correct?
[25]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
  Page 32
[1]A. Yeah. I'm not offering that opinion
[2]because I simply don't know.
[3]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) And you are not offering
[4]an opinion in this case that Mr. Chapman needs a bone
[5]marrow biopsy -- withdrawn. Have you seen anything in
[6]the medical records that have been provided to you
[7]that would allow you to conclude that Mr. Chapman
[8]needs to consider a bone marrow transplant for his SLL
[9]at this time?
[10]A. I have not seen anything in the records
[11]that have been provided me that would suggest he needs
[12]to consider a bone marrow transplant.
[13]Q. Was Mr. Chapman's SLL treatment as an
[14]outpatient; do you know?
[15]A. I'm pretty sure it was.
[16]Q. Did he ever stop working because of his
[17]SLL?
[18]A. I do not know.
[19]Q. As far as you know, he continued
[20]teaching at the community college the whole time,
[21]right?
[22]A. I simply don't know the answer to that.
[23]Q. On Page 2 of your report near the
[24]bottom, you have a list of additional past medical
[25]history. Do you see where I am?
  Page 33
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. Mr. Chapman has had multiple skin
[3]cancers, correct?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. I count seven basal cell carcinomas in
[6]your report. Does that sound right to you?
[7]A. I hope that's correct. His records on
[8]that were not completely clear. So I did my best to
[9]go back through and look at all of the records that he
[10]has and tried to sort of integrate those together, but
[11]that's to the best of my understanding.
[12]Q. Are you offering an opinion that Roundup
[13]caused Mr. Chapman's basal cell carcinomas?
[14]MR. DIAMOND: Don't look at me.
[15]A. I have asked Mr. Diamond if there was
[16]any known evidence around that because that is a lot
[17]of basal cell carcinomas.
[18]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Seven basal cell
[19]carcinomas is a lot of basal cell carcinomas, correct?
[20]A. I am not an expert in this area, but it
[21]seems a lot to me.
[22]Q. There are no opinions in your report
[23]disclosed that Roundup caused Mr. Chapman's basal cell
[24]carcinomas, correct?
[25]A. That is correct.
  Page 34
[1]Q. Sitting here today, you do not intend to
[2]offer an opinion at trial that Roundup caused
[3]Mr. Chapman's basal cell carcinoma?
[4]A. I do not.
[5]Q. Mr. Chapman also had a superficial
[6]spreading melanoma, correct?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. There are no opinions in your report
[9]that Roundup caused Mr. Chapman's melanoma, correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. You are not intending to offer an
[12]opinion at trial that Roundup caused Mr. Chapman's
[13]melanoma, right?
[14]A. No.
[15]Q. Mr. Chapman was hospitalized?
[16]A. I do not know.
[17]Q. Do you recall -- and I think you say
[18]this in your report -- that treatment for his melanoma
[19]was complicated by a bacterial infection?
[20]A. That's my understanding.
[21]Q. That required some additional surgical
[22]intervention, correct?
[23]A. That's my understanding.
[24]Q. Do you know whether he was hospitalized
[25]for that?
  Page 35
[1]A. I do not.
[2]Q. In 2014, Mr. Chapman had a myocardial
[3]infarction, right?
[4]A. That's my understanding.
[5]Q. Fancy way of saying heart attack, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. He was hospitalized for that too?
[8]A. I do not know. There was very minimal
[9]information on that in his medical record.
[10]Q. I want to go back to something that you
[11]said about skin cancer for a minute and make sure I'm
[12]understanding it. Okay?
[13]A. All right.
[14]Q. You have not done a comprehensive review
[15]of the literature to determine whether basal cell
[16]carcinoma is associated with Roundup. Is that what
[17]you said?
[18]A. I have not.
[19]Q. Have you seen literature showing that
[20]patients may have a genetic propensity for both skin
[21]cancer and NHL? I think you say something about that
[22]in your report.
[23]A. I haven't -- it's, it's -- generally
[24]there is observations that people with CLL and
[25]presumably SLL have a higher incidence of skin
  Page 36
[1]cancers. My understanding, though, is that those are
[2]primarily squamous cell carcinomas. I am not aware
[3]whether melanoma is associated with those. In
[4]general, people with CLL and SLL are thought to have
[5]higher incidence of other cancers as well that I
[6]mention in my report. And so there's additional
[7]observation and sort of heightened awareness to look
[8]for these kind of things, particularly skin cancers in
[9]people with CLL and SLL. What causes that association
[10]I think is far from clear.
[11]Q. Long answer, so I'm going to break it up
[12]a little bit. Okay.
[13]A. Sorry.
[14]Q. You're fine. New question. There are
[15]some data that folks with CLL in particular may have
[16]higher rates of at least some skin cancers, including
[17]squamous cell carcinoma, right?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. You have not looked at the literature to
[20]see whether CLL is associated with an increased risk
[21]of basal cell carcinoma or melanoma, right?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. But from a clinical perspective, if I'm
[24]understanding you right, you're saying that because of
[25]the relationship between CLL and squamous cell cancer,
  Page 37
[1]you might look more carefully for skin cancers in
[2]someone --
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. -- with a history of SLL or CLL; is that
[5]right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Okay. And I think the last thing that
[8]you said is the basis for that association is
[9]currently unclear, right?
[10]A. To me, it is, yeah.
[11]Q. We can't really say -- or you can't say
[12]sitting here whether that's due to impaired DNA
[13]repair, immunosenescence in these individuals, or some
[14]other genetic defect over time that manifests in
[15]multiple cancers?
[16]A. Correct. It could be that you have
[17]inborn genetic changes that predispose you to multiple
[18]cancers, but it could also be that CLL/SLL affects the
[19]immune system and the immune system keeps these kind
[20]of skin cancers in check and when the immune system
[21]isn't working or some combination of those or any
[22]number of other explanations.
[23]Q. What kind of errors of inborn -- what
[24]was the term that you used?
[25]A. Just inborn genetic predispositions to
  Page 38
[1]cancer.
[2]Q. What kinds of inborn genetic
[3]predispositions to cancer might predispose someone to
[4]both skin cancer and NHL?
[5]A. I do not know.
[6]Q. You also mentioned the immune system
[7]function in detecting abnormal cells, right?
[8]A. So the immune system is thought to play
[9]what's called a surveillance role. So it looks around
[10]the body for cancers, and it snuffs them out. And
[11]that could be -- we know the immune system is impaired
[12]in people with CLL and quite possibly with SLL, and so
[13]that impaired immune system could also lead to
[14]additional cancers.
[15]Q. Are you familiar with the term immune
[16]senescence or immunosenescence?
[17]A. I'm not familiar with it as a technical
[18]term. I can interpret what it must mean or it might
[19]mean.
[20]Q. What is immune senescence?
[21]A. Well, senescence just means getting old,
[22]as a person getting old, not functioning as well as
[23]when you are young.
[24]Q. What happens to the immune system as
[25]people age?
  Page 39
[1]A. There's a number of changes, but in
[2]general -- for some people -- and it's different for
[3]different people, but it can decline in some people
[4]for sure.
[5]Q. You have a section on Page 3 of your
[6]report entitled Family History. Do you see where I
[7]am?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. First sentence of that states,
[10]"Mr. Chapman's father died of possible heart failure
[11]at age 73 years old." Do you see that?
[12]A. I do.
[13]Q. I did not see in your report a date of
[14]birth for Otis Chapman. Do you recall when he was
[15]born?
[16]A. I do not.
[17]Q. I will represent to you that he was born
[18]in 1944. Do you have any reason to disagree with
[19]that?
[20]THE DEPONENT: Is that correct?
[21]MR. DIAMOND: It is. It's on his
[22]records. It says he was born on August XX.
[23]MS. ROSS: Thank you for finding that,
[24]Counsel. I was looking to see if I could find it
[25]quickly. There's no question pending.
  Page 40
[1]MR. DIAMOND: That's okay.
[2]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) New question.
[3]Mr. Chapman was born in August of 1944, correct?
[4]A. That's my understanding now.
[5]Q. He is today 76 years old?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Mr. Chapman has outlived his father
[8]despite his SLL, right?
[9]A. His father died at 73, and he's 76, yes.
[10]Q. You also say in your report that
[11]Mr. Chapman has six siblings, all of whom have died.
[12]Do you see where I am?
[13]A. Yes, yes.
[14]Q. Mr. Chapman has outlived all his
[15]siblings despite his SLL, correct?
[16]A. That's my understanding.
[17]Q. You are not offering any opinion that
[18]SLL is currently limiting his activities or life
[19]expectancy; right?
[20]A. I am not. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.
[21]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[22]A. Wait. I am not offering any opinion
[23]about his activities because I don't know. His life
[24]expectancy could certainly be impacted by SLL. If
[25]it's not in remission and it transforms, it could
  Page 41
[1]shorten it considerably.
[2]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Do you say anything in
[3]your report about Mr. Chapman's life expectancy?
[4]A. I do not.
[5]Q. And as we talked about a minute ago,
[6]there's currently no evidence that Mr. Chapman's SLL
[7]has transformed, right?
[8]A. Again, with the limited reports I have
[9]and my current knowledge, my understanding is he has
[10]not.
[11]Q. Before we leave this section of your
[12]report, let's turn back to Page 2 quickly in your HPI.
[13]You give a summary here of Mr. Chapman's presentation,
[14]diagnostic workup, pathology results, and treatment,
[15]right?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. Can you point me toward any test report,
[18]imaging study, pathology report, or physical exam
[19]finding that tells you that Roundup caused Otis
[20]Chapman's cancer?
[21]A. I cannot.
[22]Q. Can you point me toward anything in
[23]Mr. Chapman's initial presentation, workup, treatment,
[24]or response to therapy that tells you that Roundup
[25]caused Otis Chapman's cancer?
  Page 42
[1]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[2]A. Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to
[3]interpret that question.
[4]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Let me reask it or ask it
[5]differently if you're having trouble with it. Well,
[6]first, let me ask. What about that question is
[7]difficult for you?
[8]A. Well, I do have an opinion that, as
[9]stated here, that I believe Roundup can be a cause of
[10]lymphoma, and so -- but if you're asking are there
[11]specific tests or findings that would confirm that in
[12]Mr. Chapman, then no.
[13]Q. That is what I'm asking, so let me reask
[14]it. Okay? Are there specific tests or findings that
[15]would confirm that Roundup caused Mr. Chapman's
[16]cancer?
[17]A. No.
[18]Q. You walk through Mr. Chapman's initial
[19]presentation, which was with a supraclavicular lymph
[20]node, correct?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. You walk through Mr. Chapman's workup,
[23]which included a diagnostic biopsy and imaging, right?
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. And then Mr. Chapman underwent treatment
  Page 43
[1]with six cycles of immunochemotherapy, right?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. Is there anything in Otis Chapman's
[4]presentation, workup, or treatment for SLL that tells
[5]you Roundup caused Mr. Chapman's cancer?
[6]A. There is not a specific element of that
[7]that confirms that Roundup caused his cancer.
[8]Q. Is there anything at all specific or not
[9]in the way that Mr. Chapman presented, was worked up,
[10]and treated that tells you Roundup caused his cancer?
[11]A. I guess, again, I'm struggling a bit
[12]with this because it is my opinion that Roundup can be
[13]a cause of it. There is not a specific test that says
[14]it absolutely is in this person or in any person.
[15]Q. There's not a specific test and there's
[16]also nothing in Mr. Chapman's presentation and workup,
[17]right?
[18]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[19]A. Again, there is the -- at least my
[20]opinion that this is a potential cause, but there's
[21]nothing specific in the imaging, the pathology, or in
[22]the clinical presentation of Mr. Chapman that confirms
[23]that.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) And I think we're clear
[25]on the imaging and pathology. I'm just trying to make
  Page 44
[1]sure we have a clear record on clinical presentation.
[2]Okay? So let me --
[3]A. So --
[4]Q. Let me reask the question.
[5]A. Thank you.
[6]Q. Or perhaps ask a slightly better one.
[7]New question.
[8]MR. DIAMOND: You may already have what
[9]you want.
[10]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Was Otis Chapman's
[11]presentation, diagnostic workup, and treatment typical
[12]for SLL, recognizing the range of potential
[13]presentations for SLL?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Can you point me to anything specific in
[16]Otis Chapman's clinical presentation that would allow
[17]you to say, "A-ha, Roundup was the cause of this
[18]cancer"?
[19]A. Not a specific clinical presentation
[20]feature, no.
[21]Q. I want to make sure that you and I have
[22]the same basic understanding of cancer genetics. Is
[23]that all right?
[24]A. Sure.
[25]Q. Cells contain our DNA, right?
  Page 45
[1]A. Yes.
[2]Q. That DNA includes thousands of genes,
[3]right?
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. Cells in our body divide and replicate
[6]over the course of our lives, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. That process of cell division is called
[9]mitosis, correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. When cells copy their DNA and genes,
[12]they copy billions of base pairs, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. That's estimated to be about 3 billion
[15]pieces of information. Does that sound right to you?
[16]A. I actually don't know what the number --
[17]the specific number is.
[18]Q. Depending on what tissue we're talking
[19]about, some cells divide a lot, others not as much,
[20]right?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. Just like other tissues, lymphocytes
[23]divide throughout our lives, correct?
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. There are approximately 100 billion
  Page 46
[1]hematopoietic stem cells in the human body, right?
[2]A. That is not known. This is an area that
[3]I have published on pretty extensively, and that
[4]number is not at all clear.
[5]Q. What is your best estimate of how many
[6]hematopoietic stem cells there are in the human body?
[7]A. I'm going to do my best to avoid going
[8]down a rabbit hole. So the -- even the definition of
[9]a stem cell is up for debate. If you call it a cell
[10]that can generate the white blood cells, red blood
[11]cells, and platelets for very long periods --
[12]decades -- years to decades, we simply don't know.
[13]There's quite possibly anywhere from millions to
[14]billions, though.
[15]Q. This is an area in which you have some
[16]particular expertise, right?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. You have in your career, for example,
[19]run stem cell transplant programs, right?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. You also have published on hematopoietic
[22]stem cells, right?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. I think you said it's difficult to know
[25]exactly how many hematopoietic stem cells there are in
  Page 47
[1]the human body; is that right?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. Your best estimate is millions to
[4]billions of hematopoietic stem cells in the human
[5]body, right?
[6]A. Maybe. We simply don't know.
[7]Q. Do you have any idea of how often a
[8]hematopoietic stem cell divides? For example, is it
[9]every few days or few months?
[10]A. So many of them are what are called
[11]quiescent, where we think they sit there and don't
[12]divide at all. And then a relatively small number of
[13]them do divide, and they divide -- they can divide
[14]certainly in the order of days.
[15]Q. The hematopoietic stem cells that are
[16]actively dividing can divide every few days, but
[17]that's not every hematopoietic stem cell, right?
[18]A. Right.
[19]Q. We did go down a little bit of a rabbit
[20]hole, but we'll go back on that. Okay?
[21]A. I'm trying to restrain myself.
[22]Q. While the body is almost perfect in the
[23]copying process, sometimes the DNA and genes do not
[24]get copied correctly, right?
[25]A. Correct.
  Page 48
[1]Q. When DNA and genes are not copied
[2]correctly, that results in a cell that has a mutation,
[3]right?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. Mutations can occur in any type of cell
[6]in our body, including lymphocytes, right?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. Every time a cell divides, it can
[9]accumulate mutations, correct?
[10]A. There is the potential for that, yes.
[11]Q. Cells do not have to be exposed to
[12]anything external to the cell to have that mutation
[13]happen, true?
[14]A. That, I don't think is known, whether
[15]these are just pure errors just by the fact that
[16]you're doing something billions of times and things
[17]aren't perfect or whether there are external --
[18]external factors that -- it's fairly clear external
[19]factors can influence that pretty dramatically.
[20]What's not clear to me is can you get errors without
[21]any external factors.
[22]Q. Are you familiar with what's called the
[23]background mutation rate?
[24]A. Again, I don't know that as a technical
[25]term, but I can surmise what that might mean.
  Page 49
[1]Q. There are experiments in cell lines
[2]unexposed to anything else that have shown there is a
[3]background mutation rate. Are you familiar with that
[4]research?
[5]A. I am not, but cell lines by their very
[6]nature are not normal tissues. These are cells that
[7]have been propagated in a dish for months or years,
[8]which is not what normal tissues can do. So
[9]personally interpreting what you see in cell lines as
[10]what goes on in the body I think is a mistake.
[11]The other problem with that contention
[12]is that no matter where you're sitting, unless you're
[13]in a, you know -- I don't know where in the universe
[14]you could put cells where they wouldn't be exposed to
[15]some type of external factor. And again, I don't want
[16]to go down a rabbit hole, but I have a son who is a
[17]physicist. So there are physics where there are
[18]particles that go zapping through us and through
[19]cultures and through incubators all the time. So
[20]there may be -- even if you're not applying an
[21]external chemical, there are definitely external
[22]features that are impacting those things. Again, I'm
[23]trying to avoid going down another rabbit hole with
[24]you, but . . .
[25]Q. You said that interpreting what you see
  Page 50
[1]in cell lines as what you see in the body is a
[2]mistake. Do you recall that?
[3]A. I do.
[4]Q. What did you mean by that?
[5]A. Cell lines by their nature are really
[6]abnormal compared to normal cells. So, for example,
[7]in my field where I study leukemia and stem cells in
[8]leukemia, we can only grow leukemia from the body in a
[9]dish for a matter of a few days, but there are cell
[10]lines that have been heavily mutated and adapted that
[11]would grow indefinitely, and there are some cell lines
[12]that have been growing for decades. So people use
[13]those a lot, and there are some lessons from them that
[14]are useful in biology and medicine, but they by no
[15]means represent the biology of normal, healthy cells.
[16]Q. Another long answer, so we'll break that
[17]down just a little bit. All right?
[18]A. Sorry.
[19]Q. No, you're good.
[20]A. You shouldn't be asking me about --
[21]Q. Let's start with --
[22]A. -- fields that I publish a lot in.
[23]Q. Let's start with just the basics. All
[24]right?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 51
[1]Q. There are a category of experiments
[2]known as in vitro experiments, right?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. Those are things like tests you might do
[5]in cells in a petri dish, right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Then, there are in vivo experiments that
[8]might be done on a living organism, not necessarily a
[9]human, right?
[10]A. Right.
[11]Q. And then, there are studies conducted
[12]actually in living humans, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. In vitro studies in a petri dish are
[15]difficult to translate into human research, right?
[16]A. Again, it depends. Some of the in vitro
[17]studies if you're using what are called primary
[18]tissues, so cells immediately collected from the body,
[19]those can be -- I think those are, in general, more
[20]informative than cell lines, which is what people used
[21]for many years because they were easy to grow.
[22]Q. And one of the -- when you say "cell
[23]lines," you're -- well, withdrawn. There are certain
[24]cell lines that have been immortalized to be able to
[25]run tests on, right?
  Page 52
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. Similarly, there are animals and
[3]knockout models where someone has changed the genetics
[4]of an animal to be able to run tests on them, right?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. It can be difficult to generalize from
[7]those types of experiments to human beings, right?
[8]A. I think it's mixed. I think there's
[9]some information that's been very, very helpful, and
[10]there's others that you have to be careful how the
[11]experiments are done and not overinterpret what they
[12]might mean in an actual person.
[13]Q. When do you need to exercise some
[14]caution in interpreting the results of an immortalized
[15]cell line or a modified organism before concluding
[16]that your results apply to humans?
[17]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[18]A. Yeah, I mean there's a million different
[19]answers to that.
[20]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Can you give me some
[21]examples of when you would want to exercise caution in
[22]interpreting results as applying to humans?
[23]A. So in my field, we're always looking for
[24]new drugs to treat leukemia, lymphoma, and other blood
[25]cancers, and the easiest way to screen for those and
  Page 53
[1]test for those is in cell lines because we can grow a
[2]lot of them, we can test lots and lots of different
[3]drugs. I think we and others have found over the
[4]years that while that may be useful to help take a
[5]universe of, you know, many thousands of drugs down to
[6]a smaller universe, you really want to be careful and
[7]then test your candidate drugs on -- in more realistic
[8]models, like mice with human leukemia or actual human
[9]leukemia cells that are propagated in a dish, but can
[10]only do that for a few days.
[11]Q. I see.
[12]A. So there's a bit of stepwise filtration
[13]that goes on to take that back to people.
[14]Q. So the early-phase studies of what
[15]happens in a petri dish can be helpful for generating
[16]a hypothesis, right?
[17]A. Yes. And I think there's general
[18]elements of biology you can learn from cell lines,
[19]like here's a protein that's involved in DNA repair.
[20]That's probably a general lesson that will apply along
[21]the way.
[22]Q. And before you go from that to clinical
[23]cancer in humans, you'd really need to see data
[24]stepwise along the way up to data in humans that would
[25]allow you to reach that conclusion, right?
  Page 54
[1]A. I think that's a general, correct
[2]statement. The more data that you have, the better.
[3]Relying solely on cell lines as the source of truth
[4]is -- I think can be misleading.
[5]Q. Before we went down this way, we were
[6]talking about mutations. Do you remember that?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. Even after a mutation occurs, the body
[9]also has repair mechanisms that can repair the
[10]mutation that has occurred, right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. If a mutation is not repaired, the body
[13]can also kill the cell that is mutated. That's the
[14]immune surveillance function, right?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. Sometimes those mutations that make it
[17]through the body's repair mechanisms and up in places
[18]in the genome that are not known to be critical for
[19]carcinogenesis, right?
[20]A. I'm sorry. Could you say that again?
[21]Q. I'll ask it differently. A mutation
[22]that makes it all the way through the body's repair
[23]mechanism and is still there might not matter at all
[24]because it's a passenger mutation, correct?
[25]A. You're saying there can be mutations
  Page 55
[1]that don't cause cancer?
[2]Q. Yes.
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. I've heard those referred to as
[5]passenger mutations. Do you have a different term you
[6]would use?
[7]A. I have not heard that term before.
[8]Q. Have you heard the term driver mutation?
[9]A. I have heard that term.
[10]Q. Sometimes a mutation in a cell ends up
[11]in a gene that matters for cancer, right?
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. We call those driver mutations. Is that
[14]fair?
[15]A. Correct, yes.
[16]Q. Do you agree that certain mutations when
[17]they occur and are not repaired can cause a cell to
[18]divide and never stop or not die when it's supposed
[19]to?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. Mutations like that confer a growth of
[22]antigen cells, right?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. Driver mutations can happen in any
[25]cells, including lymphocytes, right?
  Page 56
[1]A. They can happen in lymphocytes. I
[2]cannot tell you they can happen in every cell.
[3]Q. Do you have just several, not every one
[4]that you know, but several examples you can give me of
[5]driver mutations in SLL in particular?
[6]A. I actually -- the one I'm most familiar
[7]with, which is probably a driver mutation, is in
[8]protein -- a gene for protein called p53.
[9]Q. Do the driver mutations involved in
[10]lymphoma vary by lymphoma subtype?
[11]A. They do.
[12]Q. In other words, the driver mutations are
[13]different for DLBCL than they are for SLL, correct?
[14]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[15]A. Yeah, that would be a speculation on my
[16]part. There's definitely -- there's almost certainly
[17]ones that overlap. The field of driver mutations and
[18]SLL I think is pretty underdeveloped. So for me to be
[19]able to say that categorically that they're different,
[20]I don't know that I know enough to or enough has been
[21]discovered yet to know whether that's the case or not.
[22]Q. (BY MS. MOSS) Are you aware, for
[23]example, of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC playing a role in some
[24]cases of DLBCL?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 57
[1]Q. Are you aware of an established role for
[2]BCL2, BLC6, or MYC in SLL?
[3]A. So I think there are some SLLs where at
[4]least BCL2 and some of the family members of BCL2 that
[5]can play a role. I do not know the data, though, on
[6]how frequent those are actually mutated within SLL.
[7]Q. How many mutations are needed for SLL?
[8]Do you know?
[9]A. I don't think anybody knows. I don't
[10]know.
[11]Q. Is it fair to say that different
[12]subtypes of NHL have different mutational signatures?
[13]A. Definitely.
[14]Q. Different subtypes of NHL can have
[15]different causes, right?
[16]A. Presumably.
[17]Q. If mutated lymphocytes are not
[18]identified and destroyed by the immune system, they
[19]can grow into a clinical cancer, right?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. Depending on the mutations, that growth
[22]might be extremely fast or it might be slow, right?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. And, again -- withdrawn. I think you
[25]already told me what immune surveillance is. Does the
  Page 58
[1]immune system have a role in finding and killing
[2]cancer cells?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. If the immune system isn't functioning
[5]properly, abnormally growing cells have a better
[6]chance of getting through, correct?
[7]A. Likely.
[8]Q. The immune system might not function
[9]properly because the patient has an immune deficiency
[10]syndrome, right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. The immune system also might not
[13]function properly because of some treatment given to a
[14]patient, like giving them drugs that chronically
[15]suppress the immune system, correct?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. You have some detail in your report on
[18]NHL generally and SLL in particular. I think that's
[19]Page 4. Can you go there with me?
[20]Are you there?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. In your report, you state, "Like most
[23]cancers, the incidence of NHL increases with age." Do
[24]you see that?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 59
[1]Q. Why is it that the incidence of NHL
[2]increases with age?
[3]A. It's a good question. Nobody knows for
[4]sure, but as you've alluded to, it's possible the
[5]chances of mutations just stack up as you get older.
[6]The immune system might get less robust. Exposure to
[7]environmental toxins might accumulate over time.
[8]There's a number of reasons why that might occur.
[9]Q. You maintain a clinical practice in
[10]addition to all of your research and administrative
[11]responsibilities, right?
[12]A. I do.
[13]Q. Have you ever seen a patient with NHL
[14]whose only risk factor for NHL was being older?
[15]MR. DIAMOND: Form and foundation.
[16]A. Yeah, I don't know the answer to that.
[17]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Have you ever treated a
[18]patient where the only risk factor you could identify
[19]for them was older age?
[20]MR. DIAMOND: Form, foundation.
[21]A. There's certainly -- if you're asking
[22]are there patients where I could not identify a risk
[23]factor other than age, that would be correct.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) That was my question, so
[25]let me ask it the way you said it.
  Page 60
[1]A. Right, if I go through the list of
[2]things that are thought to be predisposing to
[3]lymphoma, and I could not find that in people.
[4]Q. Are there patients where the only risk
[5]factor you could identify was older age?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Are there patients where the only risk
[8]factor you could identify was male gender?
[9]MR. DIAMOND: Form, foundation.
[10]A. That's a fairly sort of modest risk
[11]factor. There is a difference in some lymphomas
[12]between the incidence of males and females. If you're
[13]asking are there people where I could not identify
[14]factors that I thought contributed to their lymphoma,
[15]correct.
[16]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) You have had patients
[17]where you could not identify factors that contributed
[18]to their lymphoma, right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. You do say -- and there's a foundation
[21]objection, so I just want to be clear for the record.
[22]A. Sure.
[23]Q. If you'll go to the bottom of Page 4
[24]with me.
[25]A. Okay.
  Page 61
[1]Q. Do you see where you say, "CLL/SLL is
[2]more common in males than females"?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. What does that mean?
[5]A. It means the incidence is higher in men
[6]than women.
[7]Q. And you have seen a patient who is male
[8]and had no other identifiable risk factors for SLL,
[9]right?
[10]MR. DIAMOND: Form and foundation.
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) You also say that SLL is
[13]indolent. What does that mean?
[14]A. Indolent means that it's slow-growing.
[15]Again, as you very nicely said it earlier, there's a
[16]very wide variation. There are definitely CLLs in
[17]particular that can be quite aggressive and grow very
[18]quickly. The majority of both of those grow slowly,
[19]and that's what indolent means.
[20]Q. When did Mr. Chapman's SLL start?
[21]A. Impossible to know.
[22]Q. Could it have started before 1987?
[23]A. His -- it's possible, but he only
[24]noticed the lymph node within a few months, I think,
[25]of his -- of his visit. Could he have had a small
  Page 62
[1]amount that was lurking there prior to that for some
[2]time? That's possible.
[3]Q. Certainly no way to rule that out,
[4]right?
[5]A. No way to know for sure, that's correct.
[6]Q. You were talking just now, I think,
[7]about the clinically identifiable cancer, which was an
[8]enlarged lymph node in Mr. Chapman's case, right?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. Sometime before that lymph node became
[11]enlarged, there were a series of mutations that
[12]developed into a clinically detectable cancer, right?
[13]A. Likely.
[14]Q. Do you know how many mutations were
[15]needed for Mr. Chapman's SLL to develop?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. In Mr. Chapman's case, do you know when
[18]the first mutation occurred?
[19]A. No.
[20]Q. You cannot disprove that that happened
[21]prior to 1987, true?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. In your report at Page 3, you also have
[24]a section on the history of -- I'm sorry. That's not
[25]Page 3. Withdrawn. No, it is.
  Page 63
[1]A. Page 3?
[2]Q. Page 3. Do you see you have a section
[3]of History of Exposure to Roundup?
[4]A. Yes.
[5]Q. As we talked about earlier in your
[6]deposition, your information on Mr. Chapman's Roundup
[7]exposure came from three sources, right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. His amended PFS, correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. His deposition testimony, right?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. And Dr. Sawyer's report, correct?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. You have never seen Mr. Chapman spray
[16]Roundup, right?
[17]A. I have not seen him spray Roundup.
[18]Q. You saw no receipts of his use of
[19]Roundup, right?
[20]A. No.
[21]Q. Did you see any medical records
[22]documenting his use of Roundup?
[23]A. I do not recall.
[24]Q. Would it change your opinion at all if
[25]Mr. Chapman actually never used Roundup?
  Page 64
[1]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[2]A. If he never used Roundup?
[3]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Right.
[4]A. Would my opinion about Roundup
[5]potentially being a cause for his lymphoma change?
[6]Q. Correct.
[7]A. Of course.
[8]Q. Why is that?
[9]A. If he wasn't exposed to Roundup, it's
[10]hard to invoke that as a cause for his lymphoma.
[11]Q. You would agree that not using Roundup
[12]does not put one at increased risk of NHL, right?
[13]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[14]A. I did not follow all the nots there.
[15]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) If someone did not use
[16]Roundup, they are not at increased risk of NHL from
[17]glyphosate exposure, correct?
[18]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[19]A. I guess I can see where if they hadn't
[20]used it but been involved in its manufacture or been
[21]around, you know, environmental areas where it was
[22]heavily utilized or they were in an industrial
[23]accident. So I can certainly come up with lots of
[24]different ways that one could be exposed to Roundup,
[25]but if one was never exposed to Roundup under any
  Page 65
[1]circumstances, it would be hard to invoke that as a
[2]cause of lymphoma.
[3]Q. And that was my question, so let me
[4]reask it. Okay? Yes?
[5]A. If you have never been exposed to
[6]Roundup in any way, shape, or form, it's -- right, it
[7]would not be a causative factor for lymphoma.
[8]Q. A normal --
[9]A. Am I missing something here?
[10]Q. You're not. I think I just -- maybe
[11]we're making this more complicated than it needs to
[12]be.
[13]MR. DIAMOND: I think the difference was
[14]exposed versus used.
[15]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) So let me reask the
[16]question.
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. A normal person in the United States
[19]who's never used Roundup, who's never worked in a
[20]Roundup factory, who's never had known environmental
[21]exposure to Roundup, they are not at increased risk of
[22]NHL from Roundup exposure, right?
[23]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[24]A. Correct, I think. I'm struggling to
[25]understand the question. If you're not exposed to
  Page 66
[1]it --
[2]MR. DIAMOND: And my problem with the
[3]form was known exposure. I'd just say any exposure.
[4]A. If you've never been exposed to
[5]something, by definition, it cannot cause something.
[6]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Right. If someone does
[7]not use Roundup, they cannot be at increased risk for
[8]glyphosate exposure, correct?
[9]MR. DIAMOND: Form. Again, it's
[10]because you say -- you don't want me to say why.
[11]MS. ROSS: So please don't explain.
[12]Just let the doctor answer.
[13]MR. DIAMOND: I understand. I just
[14]wasn't sure if you were picking up.
[15]A. Again, if the distinction is use versus
[16]exposure, I can come up with many, many different
[17]scenarios where someone could be exposed to it without
[18]using it.
[19]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Is your -- and I'm not
[20]talking about someone who is working in a glyphosate
[21]factory or something like that. Okay?
[22]A. Right.
[23]Q. Just normal person, no residential or
[24]occupational use of Roundup. You would not say that
[25]that person is at increased risk of NHL from
  Page 67
[1]glyphosate exposure, correct?
[2]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[3]A. So a typical exception to that would
[4]be -- I'm thinking work I did when I was younger. So
[5]I worked, you know, outside in fields and others.
[6]There could be somebody spraying stuff all the time
[7]that I'm inhaling even though I'm not using it myself.
[8]You know, I'm over putting in a fence post while
[9]someone else is spraying this downwind [sic] from me.
[10]So --
[11]Q. Sure. But if you never had occasion to
[12]get Roundup on your skin or inhale it, you are not at
[13]increased risk of NHL from Roundup exposure, correct?
[14]A. Right. Again, if you're not exposed to
[15]something, you cannot -- that cannot cause something
[16]else.
[17]Q. Your report on Page 9 in your conclusion
[18]section says, "Mr. Chapman has been exposed to
[19]Roundup/glyphosate in a manner and magnitude that fits
[20]within the published epidemiologic literature." Do
[21]you see where I am?
[22]A. Which page are you?
[23]MR. DIAMOND: Top of Page 9.
[24]A. Oh, 9. Sorry. Yes.
[25]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) When you say Mr. Chapman
  Page 68
[1]has been exposed to Roundup or glyphosate in a manner
[2]and magnitude that fits within the published
[3]epidemiologic literature, you're talking about studies
[4]that looked at people who actually sprayed Roundup or
[5]used it in some fashion, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. That is what you mean when you say that
[8]Mr. Roundup -- withdrawn. When you say Mr. Chapman
[9]used Roundup in a way that's associated with an
[10]increased risk, you mean that he sprayed Roundup and
[11]was exposed to glyphosate, correct?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]MS. ROSS: Let's take a short break.
[14]MR. DIAMOND: How long do you want to
[15]take?
[16]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record
[17]at 9:23. This marks the end of Media 1.
[18](Recess taken.)
[19]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This marks the start
[20]of Media 2 of the video deposition of Clayton Smith,
[21]M.D. We're back on the record. The time is 9:47.
[22]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Dr. Smith, just before
[23]the break, we were speaking about your report on Page
[24]9. Are you still there?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 69
[1]Q. You say that "Mr. Chapman has been
[2]exposed to Roundup/glyphosate." I'm going to stop
[3]there for a minute. Okay?
[4]A. Okay.
[5]Q. Your opinion is that Otis Chapman's
[6]exposure to glyphosate increased his risk of NHL,
[7]correct?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. Did Mr. Chapman ever have measurements
[10]taken that showed the presence of glyphosate in his
[11]blood, urine, or body tissues?
[12]A. Not that I'm aware of.
[13]Q. Does everyone who uses Roundup have
[14]measurable glyphosate in their body?
[15]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[16]A. I don't know the answer to that.
[17]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) You have not looked at
[18]the literature on whether everyone who uses Roundup
[19]has measured glyphosate in their body, fair?
[20]A. I am not aware there is literature that
[21]looks at everybody that uses Roundup and has measured.
[22]That seems pretty unlikely to me.
[23]Q. Have you looked at any literature
[24]whether some people who sprayed Roundup do, in fact,
[25]have measurable glyphosate in their bodies?
  Page 70
[1]A. I believe there were -- there have been
[2]studies where they have looked at that.
[3]Q. I did not see any of those studies cited
[4]in your report. You're not relying on any studies
[5]with regard to measurable glyphosate levels in
[6]someone's body, correct?
[7]A. No, correct.
[8]Q. The answer to my question is correct,
[9]yes? I think there was a double negative.
[10]A. No, I'm not relying. I agree with your
[11]statement.
[12]Q. Thank you. And you cannot point me to
[13]any test at any time that would show that Mr. Chapman
[14]had measurable glyphosate in his body, right?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. Do you know if those tests exist, if you
[17]could test someone's blood for glyphosate?
[18]A. I do have a recollection that I saw some
[19]studies, but these are vague. I thought they had done
[20]some measurements in people in South America that were
[21]exposed pretty heavily, but I cannot swear to that.
[22]I'm speculating.
[23]Q. You have not done anything to
[24]investigate how much glyphosate Mr. Chapman actually
[25]absorbed, if he absorbed any; that's true, right?
  Page 71
[1]A. That's true.
[2]Q. You're not relying on any measurement of
[3]glyphosate in Mr. Chapman's body?
[4]A. Right.
[5]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[6]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Because as far as you
[7]know, none of them have been done, right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. Are you relying on any estimation or
[10]calculation of glyphosate in Mr. Chapman's body as
[11]opposed to a direct measurement?
[12]A. As opposed to the general exposure
[13]history, the prolonged history, the history before he
[14]was diagnosed?
[15]Q. Right.
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. What you mention in your report in the
[18]sentence we were just looking at is glyphosate as a
[19]risk factor for NHL, right?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. Were there any other ingredients in the
[22]Roundup Mr. Chapman used that you considered
[23]significant for your analysis?
[24]A. No.
[25]Q. Well, that saves us some time then.
  Page 72
[1]MR. DIAMOND: Surfactants.
[2]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) I think we can cut this
[3]fairly short, so let me just ask a few questions to
[4]make sure we're in agreement. Okay?
[5]A. Okay.
[6]Q. Is it true for all Plaintiffs whose
[7]records you have reviewed that your opinion is not
[8]based on the type or amount of anything in Roundup
[9]other than glyphosate?
[10]A. Only glyphosate.
[11]Q. You say in your report I think about
[12]Page 4, top of Page 4 -- are you there?
[13]A. Okay.
[14]Q. You say in your report that Otis Chapman
[15]could taste the Roundup he was spraying. Do you see
[16]that?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Does glyphosate even have a taste?
[19]A. I do not know.
[20]Q. Do the surfactants in Roundup have a
[21]taste?
[22]A. I do not know.
[23]Q. You do not know whether Mr. Chapman
[24]tasted the glyphosate or the surfactants?
[25]A. No.
  Page 73
[1]Q. How much glyphosate did Mr. Chapman take
[2]in orally?
[3]A. I do not know.
[4]Q. Have you reviewed the literature
[5]enough -- I think you said a minute ago that you've
[6]reviewed some literature on glyphosate levels in the
[7]body, right?
[8]A. I think so.
[9]Q. Have you reviewed the literature enough
[10]to know that any glyphosate that is absorbed is out of
[11]the body within 24 hours?
[12]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[13]A. I'm sorry. I'm trying to think back a
[14]couple of years. I believe I have seen information
[15]that says it's excreted fairly quickly, but I cannot
[16]be specific -- more specific than that.
[17]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) You've seen information
[18]in the literature that any glyphosate absorbed is
[19]excreted fairly quickly, correct?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. You don't recall whether that's
[22]primarily kidney excretion or --
[23]A. I don't, and I think there's -- like
[24]every chemical, there's likely a lot of qualifications
[25]to that information. For example, it could sit in a
  Page 74
[1]site like the skin and you wouldn't be able to measure
[2]it.
[3]Q. Does the Roundup label say anything
[4]about avoiding contact with Roundup?
[5]A. I do not know.
[6]Q. Does the label say anything about not
[7]breathing it in?
[8]A. I don't know.
[9]Q. Does the label say anything about being
[10]harmful if swallowed?
[11]A. I don't know.
[12]Q. Have you ever read the Roundup label?
[13]A. I read it briefly when I did -- when I
[14]had an initial case on this and read all the
[15]literature. I had used Roundup, and so I read it
[16]briefly and then threw mine away, but I cannot recall
[17]if there are specific warnings about exposure or
[18]swallowing.
[19]Q. Would it surprise you if the Roundup
[20]label said harmful if swallowed?
[21]A. It would not surprise me.
[22]Q. Do you have any idea if Mr. Chapman read
[23]those parts of the Roundup label?
[24]A. I do not know.
[25]Q. He teaches college and presumably could
  Page 75
[1]have read the label, right?
[2]A. Pure speculation. I'm a college
[3]professor, and I did not read the label until I threw
[4]mine out.
[5]Q. Did you think that Mr. Chapman should
[6]have read and tried to comply with the Roundup label?
[7]MR. DIAMOND: Form, foundation.
[8]A. Sure.
[9]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) In your report, if we go
[10]back to this end part where you talk about Roundup and
[11]glyphosate -- tell me when you're back there. Are you
[12]there?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. Your opinion is that "Mr. Chapman has
[15]been exposed to Roundup in a matter and magnitude that
[16]fits within the published epidemiologic literature and
[17]studies where causation and an association between NHL
[18]and glyphosate has been demonstrated," right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. Your report says "causation and an
[21]association between NHL and glyphosate," right?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. Causation and association are not the
[24]same, true?
[25]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
  Page 76
[1]A. Yes, they are not the same.
[2]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) What is the difference
[3]between causation and association?
[4]A. I would say association is more of a
[5]statistical concurrence of two events. They happen to
[6]occur. You don't know whether they are necessarily
[7]one has caused the other. And the reason I've
[8]separated those is I think -- I tend to think of
[9]epidemiologic studies, of which there are many, are
[10]association studies, and then the causation studies
[11]are more around, in this particular case, does the
[12]chemical glyphosate cause DNA damage and oxidation and
[13]other -- other known predisposing factors to cancer.
[14]Q. Dr. Smith, I'm going to break that up a
[15]little. Okay?
[16]A. Sure.
[17]Q. Epidemiologic studies of which there are
[18]many are association studies, correct?
[19]A. I believe so.
[20]Q. There are mechanism studies that look at
[21]DNA damage or oxidative stress, right?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. In the practice of medicine, are you
[24]familiar with the idea of evidence-based medicine?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 77
[1]Q. In general, there's a hierarchy of
[2]evidence, right?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. For clinical practice, randomized
[5]control trials are often considered the gold standard
[6]for evidence, right?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. That is not always possible to do,
[9]particularly when you're looking at exposures that are
[10]potentially harmful, right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. Are you aware that, then, sort of the
[13]next tier down from randomized trials are
[14]epidemiologic studies?
[15]A. I would not agree with that.
[16]Q. You would not?
[17]A. No.
[18]Q. Okay. What would you say are the next
[19]tier down in evidence from randomized control trials
[20]for determining a relationship between two things?
[21]A. I don't really view it as a tier system.
[22]I think it's a -- it's look at the aggregate data, and
[23]data comes from many different types of studies. That
[24]can be in vitro studies, like you talked about before.
[25]They can be epidemiologic studies. And I think -- at
  Page 78
[1]least, again, this is my approach, is to try to
[2]aggregate all those together, look at the good and the
[3]bad, because there's good and bad in every study,
[4]shape that -- or compare that to my own personal
[5]experience, and then, you know, do my best to
[6]formulate an opinion based on that. I'm not sure
[7]there's a nice, clean hierarchy system like you
[8]describe.
[9]Q. I think you said that not all
[10]associations are causal; is that right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. Are you aware of any epidemiologic
[13]studies in the published literature on Roundup and NHL
[14]where the authors themselves concluded causation was
[15]established?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. The same sentence in your report talks
[18]about NHL overall and glyphosate, right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. You say an association between NHL and
[21]glyphosate?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. When you reviewed the epidemiology for
[24]this case, did you focus on NHL overall or subtype
[25]data?
  Page 79
[1]A. I tried to do both. So the problem with
[2]subtype data is that SLL is a small percentage of all
[3]lymphomas. So the epidemiologic data, the more people
[4]you have with a particular entity, like SLL, the
[5]stronger the data is. And so this is a challenge when
[6]you're dealing with relatively rare diseases. Do you
[7]want me to stop so you can break that up?
[8]Q. Let's break that down.
[9]A. I have more to say on that.
[10]Q. Yes. Thank you. New question. SLL is
[11]a relatively rare subtype of NHL, right?
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. For rare subtypes of NHL, it may be
[14]difficult to elucidate a relationship between a
[15]particular exposure and that particular disease,
[16]correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. In your report, I think you talk about
[19]this on Page 8, if you'll go there with me.
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. You say that -- let me just find it --
[22]very top of the page, "Specific epidemiologic
[23]associations between specific subtypes of NHL are
[24]difficult to define due to statistical
[25]considerations." Right?
  Page 80
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. This is particularly true for unusual
[3]subtypes like SLL, right?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. And that's as compared to something like
[6]DLBCL, where you have many more cases, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. SLL is still rare today?
[9]A. Right.
[10]Q. You then cite some studies in your
[11]report that did try to look at CLL and SLL
[12]specifically, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. The first one that you mention, I think,
[15]is -- let's find it -- Chang and Delzell. No, I'm
[16]sorry. That's not the first.
[17]A. Pahwa.
[18]Q. Withdrawn. The first study you mention
[19]is Pahwa, right?
[20]A. Correct.
[21]Q. And then you go on to say Chang and
[22]Delzell performed a meta-analysis on glyphosate and
[23]CLL risk. Do you see that?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. The meta-RR reported in that study,
  Page 81
[1]Chang and Delzell, you say is 1.3 to 1.9. Do you see
[2]that?
[3]A. Uh-huh.
[4]Q. But then you say that the study was
[5]limited by small numbers, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. In your opinion, Chang 2016 was limited
[8]by small numbers, true?
[9]A. I think all the studies on SLL and
[10]glyphosate are limited.
[11]Q. The meta-RR of 1.3 to 1.9 in Chang 2016
[12]was nonsignificant, correct?
[13]A. I'd have to go back and look at what the
[14]specific language the authors used. I, again -- the
[15]term "significance" is trying to put an absolute on
[16]something that's not absolute. It's a continuum.
[17]There's weight of evidence that when it crosses -- for
[18]publication purposes, frequently there's a particular
[19]line that they draw in the sand that says something is
[20]significant or not significant. That's not how
[21]evidence works or nature works. There's just strength
[22]of evidence. There is no line that as has been used
[23]in medical literature for a long time.
[24]Q. When we talk in medicine about whether a
[25]finding was significant or not significant, we're
  Page 82
[1]typically referring to statistical significance,
[2]right?
[3]A. You're referring to language that I
[4]think is incorrect.
[5]Q. If you were working on a clinical trial
[6]for a new lymphoma treatment, would you ever describe
[7]statistically nonsignificant findings as significant?
[8]A. No. What -- I think it's -- the better
[9]way to do that is to show the statistical tools, the
[10]answers. Again, for many publications, insist that
[11]you draw a line.
[12]Q. Right.
[13]A. I'm just giving you my own personal
[14]interpretation. So a typical thing, it's called
[15]p-hacking, where you use the line in the sand that
[16]says if it's less than 5 percent unlikely to happen by
[17]chance, it's considered statistically significant. To
[18]me, that makes no sense, because if it's 4.9 percent,
[19]is that really different from 5.1 percent, and yet
[20]this line has been drawn between significance and
[21]nonsignificance.
[22]So at least when I interpret literature,
[23]I like to see what the data looks like and to see is
[24]it -- you know, is that strength of significance
[25]strong.
  Page 83
[1]Q. Okay. Long answer, so let me stop you
[2]there for a minute. All right?
[3]A. Sorry. Yes.
[4]Q. You mentioned p-hacking, correct?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. When one looks at a study and simply
[7]considers whether the P estimate is less than .05 or
[8]greater than .05, that is not a correct way to
[9]interpret data in your opinion, correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. Would it save us some time and headache
[12]if instead of asking you questions about whether a
[13]finding was significant, I clarified that I am
[14]speaking of statistical significance?
[15]A. Well, I think even many statisticians
[16]argue over that term.
[17]Q. But you are familiar with the general
[18]idea in medical literature that a P value greater than
[19].05 or a 95 percent confidence interval that includes
[20]1 is not statistically significant, right?
[21]A. I am aware that that is a traditional
[22]definition that many statisticians and people who read
[23]literature consider archaic and inappropriate, and I
[24]am not one of those.
[25]Q. And you do not consider P values or
  Page 84
[1]confidence intervals to determine whether a finding is
[2]significant? Is that what I'm understanding?
[3]A. I think the confidence and P values are
[4]very important. What I don't agree with is there's a
[5]magical line at .05 that creates a distinction between
[6]something being completely significant or completely
[7]insignificant. And again, the simplest example of
[8]that, if the P value is .049 versus .051, is that
[9]really different? And yet in the definition you've
[10]provided, those would be -- one would be considered
[11]significant and the other insignificant, and I would
[12]argue there's probably very little difference between
[13]those things.
[14]Q. In your report, you do not include
[15]confidence intervals for Chang 2016, right?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. And sitting here today, you don't
[18]remember whether that 1.3 and 1.9 were statistically
[19]significant or not, right?
[20]A. By the definition that you've provided
[21]of .05 significance, I do not recall.
[22](Deposition Exhibit 4 was marked.)
[23]Q. Let me just hand you Exhibit 4 to your
[24]deposition, which is Chang 2016, and we'll see if we
[25]can do this quickly. Okay?
  Page 85
[1]MR. DIAMOND: Which exhibit number?
[2]MS. ROSS: 4.
[3]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Dr. Smith, do you have
[4]Exhibit 4 there?
[5]A. I do.
[6]Q. Would you turn to Page 416 of this
[7]exhibit? Are you there, Dr. Smith?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. In Chang 2016, in their first model, the
[10]random effects model, the relationship between
[11]glyphosate and risk of CLL/SLL was 1.3, right?
[12]A. This is in Table 3?
[13]Q. Yes. And it might actually be easier to
[14]read from the text, so let me try this instead. Do
[15]you see the paragraph that starts, "Based on the same
[16]two studies" below Table 3?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. In Chang 2016, the random effects model
[19]showed a meta-RR for Roundup and CLL/SLL of 1.3,
[20]right?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. The 95 percent confidence interval was
[23].2 to 10. Do you see that?
[24]A. I do.
[25]Q. For the fixed effects model, the meta-RR
  Page 86
[1]was 1.9, right?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. The 95 percent confidential interval was
[4]0.9 to 4.0, right?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. You can put that Exhibit 4 aside for the
[7]moment. The other study that we were talking about
[8]just a moment ago was Pahwa 2019, right?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. Do you consider Pahwa 2019 to be a
[11]well-designed study?
[12]A. I am not a statistician, but I have not
[13]seen a single well-designed study in any of the
[14]literature that I've reviewed.
[15]Q. You have not seen a single well-designed
[16]study of Roundup and NHL, correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. Why is that?
[19]A. I think these are -- these are, by
[20]definition, in -- each individual study just has a lot
[21]of messiness associated with it, lots of issues around
[22]patient selection and recall basis, a lot of elements
[23]that affect all that. The numbers are limited. So
[24]when I look at each individual study, none of them is
[25]convincing on their own. What was convincing for me
  Page 87
[1]was the -- again, all of the aggregate epidemiologic
[2]and laboratory studies together.
[3]Q. Taking the data together, you believe
[4]that there is adequate evidence for an association
[5]between Roundup and NHL, right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. In the individual studies, there were,
[8]in all of the epidemiologic studies, issues around
[9]patient selection, correct?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. In all of the epidemiologic studies,
[12]there were issues around recall bias, right?
[13]A. That, I cannot speak to. I'm just
[14]saying in general these are some of the problems you
[15]have with some of these retrospective epidemiologic
[16]studies, but I hesitate to make generalizations about
[17]specific problems with, you know, all of the studies.
[18]Q. Would it be better to look prospectively
[19]at whether Roundup was associated with an increased
[20]risk of NHL instead of retrospectively in case central
[21]studies?
[22]A. In an ideal world.
[23]Q. You in your report mention Pahwa's
[24]conclusion, I think, as it relates to SLL. You've got
[25]a sentence in there. Do you see where I am?
  Page 88
[1]A. We're back to?
[2]Q. Actually, let me just withdraw that and
[3]ask a different question.
[4]A. Okay.
[5]Q. Do you remember whether Pahwa -- do you
[6]remember anything about Pahwa 2019 sitting here today?
[7]A. I'd have to go back and look at the
[8]paper.
[9]Q. Luckily, we can do that.
[10]A. Great.
[11](Deposition Exhibit 5 was marked.)
[12]Q. Dr. Smith, Exhibit 5 to your deposition
[13]is the Pahwa 2019 paper.
[14]A. Thank you.
[15]Q. The title of this paper talks about
[16]findings from the North American pooled project. Do
[17]you see that?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. Pahwa 2019 pooled data from earlier case
[20]control studies in North America, right?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. Is it your recollection that Pahwa 2019
[23]contains more data than any of the earlier case
[24]controlled studies looking at glyphosate and NHL?
[25]A. I don't know. I'd have to go back and
  Page 89
[1]look at each of the studies.
[2]Q. If you'll turn with me to Table 2 in
[3]Pahwa 2019, this table talks about ever and never
[4]glyphosate use and associations with NHL and
[5]histological subtypes, correct?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. There are numbers given for the folks
[8]who never used glyphosate, the number of cases who
[9]never used glyphosate. Do you see that?
[10]A. I do.
[11]Q. There are also numbers given for ever
[12]users of glyphosate in Pahwa 2019. Do you see where
[13]those are?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. And then there are also in this table
[16]two odds ratios, ORa and ORb. Do you see those?
[17]A. I do.
[18]Q. When it's got a little B next to it, do
[19]you see that that's adjusted for other pesticides?
[20]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[21]A. Little B. So the little B is adjusted
[22]for a variety of features. At the end, it says
[23]including the use of 2, 4-D, dicamba, and malathion.
[24]Is that what you're referring to?
[25]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) That's what I'm referring
  Page 90
[1]to, yes. Thank you. So the -- new question. In
[2]Pahwa 2019, the odds ratios that were adjusted for
[3]other pesticide use are the ORs with a superscript
[4]note b, correct?
[5]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Those are the most
[8]adjusted odds ratios in Pahwa 2019, right? They
[9]adjust in an everything plus those three things, yes?
[10]A. I have no idea if those are the most
[11]adjusted odds ratios.
[12]Q. Do you see any other odds ratios that
[13]we're looking at?
[14]A. You're talking about Table 2?
[15]Q. Yes.
[16]A. I'm sorry. I thought we were referring
[17]to the entire paper.
[18]Q. We could go through all the tables, if
[19]you want. I was just trying to save us a little bit
[20]of time. But feel free to take a look at Tables 3, 4,
[21]and 5 as well, and then if you can confirm for me that
[22]the odds ratios B are the most adjusted for Pahwa
[23]2019.
[24]A. That's going to take some serious study
[25]for me to compare those going line by line, because in
  Page 91
[1]3, 4, and 5, you have a whole variety of adjustments
[2]as well.
[3]Q. I think at this point, the only odds
[4]ratios in those tables are ORa and ORb, right?
[5]A. We're talking about --
[6]Q. Tables 3, 4, and 45.
[7]A. Correct. But if you look below that,
[8]the superscripts a and b say adjusted for a variety of
[9]different things. Again, I'd have to go back and say
[10]are those the same as in Table 2 or not. They
[11]actually look to me pretty similar to the ones in
[12]Table 2.
[13]Q. I was actually not trying to trick you,
[14]Dr. Smith.
[15]MR. DIAMOND: If you just represent it
[16]and we'll take your word for it, if you'd like.
[17]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) So why don't you just
[18]take a quick moment with those tables and get
[19]comfortable with what ORa and ORb are, and then I'll
[20]ask you one question.
[21]A. Okay. It looks to me like the
[22]definition of A and B are consistent throughout the
[23]tables.
[24]Q. ORb in Pahwa 2019, those are the odds
[25]ratios that are adjusted for other pesticide use,
  Page 92
[1]correct?
[2]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[3]A. Compared to ORa, yes.
[4]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Do the authors make a
[5]reasonable choice to adjust for 2, 4-D, dicamba, and
[6]malathion?
[7]A. I do not know.
[8]Q. Do you agree that it is better to use
[9]more fully adjusted data when it's available?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. For NHL overall, if we go back to Table
[12]2 for a moment --
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. -- Mr. Chapman would fall into the ever
[15]users in Table 2, right?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. Adjusted for other pesticides, that's an
[18]odds ratio of 1.13, correct?
[19]A. Sorry. For SLL?
[20]Q. For NHL overall.
[21]A. Right, adjusted ORb is 1.13.
[22]Q. You just mentioned SLL, so let's do that
[23]one next. All right?
[24]A. Right.
[25]Q. For SLL specifically, there were 15
  Page 93
[1]cases in Pahwa who ever used glyphosate, right?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. For SLL, the adjusted odds ratio for
[4]other pesticides was 1.79, right?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. The 95 percent confidential interval is
[7].87 to 3.69, right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. We can agree that Pahwa 2019 showed no
[10]significant -- statistically significant association
[11]between SLL and Roundup, right?
[12]A. We can agree that the odds ratio B falls
[13]within the 95 percent confidence interval for that,
[14]almost certainly because of the small patient number.
[15]Q. If I'm understanding you right, we've
[16]spoken about Chang 2016 and Pahwa 2019, right?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. Neither of those showed a statistically
[19]significant 95 percent confidence interval for a
[20]relationship between SLL and Roundup use, right?
[21]A. Right, using the technical definition of
[22]statistical significance that you've laid out.
[23]Q. And that is -- it's a true statement
[24]they are small studies, right?
[25]A. The number of people with SLL in both of
  Page 94
[1]those is quite small.
[2]Q. It's a true statement that the
[3]association between SLL and Roundup was not
[4]statistically significant in either of those studies,
[5]right?
[6]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[7]A. Again, using the technical definition of
[8]statistical significance that you've defined as a
[9]95 percent versus 5 percent.
[10]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Using the technical
[11]definition of statistical significance, neither Pahwa
[12]2019 nor Chang 2016 showed a statistical significance
[13]between SLL and Roundup, correct?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. What would be a lot of cases of SLL
[16]specifically to consider?
[17]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[18]A. I'm sorry. I don't understand.
[19]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Would a study with 100
[20]cases be a lot of cases of SLL to consider?
[21]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[22]A. 100 cases. I mean, it's definitely
[23]better than 50.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Would --
[25]A. Again, the more you have, the better.
  Page 95
[1]Q. And again -- since you talk about the
[2]data on SLL specifically in your report, I'm trying to
[3]get a sense from you, Dr. Smith --
[4]A. Right.
[5]Q. -- of what you would consider to be a
[6]large study on this.
[7]A. I think you'd have to sit with a
[8]statistician to look at this initial data. They do
[9]power calculations to get at these numbers: how many
[10]do you need to see where it does meet that 95 percent
[11]cutoff that you use as statistically significant, and
[12]I don't know the answer to that. I'm guessing it
[13]would be hundred -- hundreds.
[14]Q. 15 is too small, right?
[15]A. 15 is too small.
[16]Q. Hundreds would be better, fair?
[17]A. Hundreds would be better.
[18]Q. In your report on Page 7, about midway
[19]down the page, you talk about a study of three large
[20]agriculture worker cohorts in Europe. Do you see
[21]that?
[22]A. Do you know which reference number it
[23]is?
[24]Q. Number 15.
[25]A. This is pretty dense text.
  Page 96
[1]MR. DIAMOND: It's somewhere right
[2]around here.
[3]A. This is of the ever use of 14 and 33 in
[4]pooled analysis of three aggregate -- that's what
[5]you're referring to?
[6]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) That's what I'm referring
[7]to, right.
[8]A. Okay.
[9]Q. So here in your report, you say there
[10]was a study that looked at the relationship of ever
[11]use between 14 selected pesticide groups and 33
[12]individual chemical ingredients and three large
[13]agricultural cohorts in Europe, right?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. You go on to say that glyphosate
[16]increased the risk of NHL in that study, and you give
[17]a meta hazard ratio of 1.36. Do you see that?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. The cite is to a paper by Leon and
[20]colleagues in 2019, right?
[21]A. That is correct.
[22]Q. You cited Leon here because you believe
[23]it supports your position that Roundup use is
[24]associated with NHL overall, right?
[25]A. So -- so to be clear, what impresses me
  Page 97
[1]with the epidemiologic study is the aggregate studies.
[2]You know the forest plot where they line up all of the
[3]different studies and they look in aggregate whether
[4]they are negatively or positively associated with
[5]something?
[6]Q. Are you speaking there of Dr. Ritz's
[7]report and the forest plot that's included there?
[8]A. Actually, the most recent one that I
[9]thought was really compelling was in the updated
[10]report from Dr. Portier, but there are many of these
[11]in the other general causation reports and in the
[12]literature.
[13]Q. Dr. Portier is a paid expert for the
[14]Plaintiffs in this litigation, right?
[15]A. I don't know.
[16]Q. You've cited him as one of Plaintiffs'
[17]general causation experts. I think that's how you
[18]describe him in your report.
[19]A. Right. I just don't know what his
[20]relationship is.
[21]Q. You do know that Dr. Portier is a paid
[22]expert for the Plaintiffs in this litigation, right?
[23]THE DEPONENT: Is he paid? I'm assuming
[24]he is, but I don't know.
[25]MR. DIAMOND: He doesn't have -- I don't
  Page 98
[1]know I've ever discussed with him that he's paid or
[2]not. I think he can make an assumption, like he said.
[3]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) You have Dr. Portier's
[4]report. You wouldn't be surprised if he lists his
[5]hourly rate in it and he's an expert for the
[6]Plaintiffs, right?
[7]A. I wouldn't be surprised if he's paid for
[8]it.
[9]Q. Have you seen any forest plots or meta
[10]hazard ratios reported in the published literature
[11]that describe an overall meta-RR for NHL and Roundup
[12]use?
[13]A. Well, I mean, I'd have to go back
[14]through each paper and look at it. Forest plots are,
[15]you know, almost universal in these types of
[16]meta-analysis, and I'm certain within some of them,
[17]there are some forest plots.
[18]Q. Is that something you would want to look
[19]at, is what's been published in the actual medical
[20]literature on whether there's an association between
[21]Roundup and NHL?
[22]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[23]A. Yeah, of course.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) We were speaking about
[25]Leon 2019 just a minute ago. Do you remember that?
  Page 99
[1]A. Oh, sorry, that's not one of the papers
[2]you've provided. Correct.
[3]Q. Well, since you mention that . . .
[4]A. Excellent.
[5](Deposition Exhibit 6 was marked.)
[6]Q. Exhibit 6 to your deposition is a paper
[7]by Leon and colleagues. Do you see that?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. Leon 2019 is a pooled analysis from
[10]cohorts in agricultural users, right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. Leon is a 2019 publication, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. It would not have been part of IARC's
[15]2015 evaluation, correct?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. You, I think, also cite Zhang 2019 in
[18]that report. Do you remember that?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. Leon was not included in Zhang's
[21]analysis, correct?
[22]A. I do not know. I'd have to go back and
[23]look at Zhang.
[24]Q. If you'll turn with me to Page 8 of Leon
[25]2019. There's a table that we can take a look at.
  Page 100
[1]Tell me when you're there.
[2]A. This?
[3]Q. That would be the table. Table 2 in
[4]Leon 2019 gives ever use of all of the different
[5]pesticide groups that they looked at with all of the
[6]different active ingredients, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Table 2 in Leon 2019 then lists meta
[9]risk estimates fully adjusted of NHL lymphoid
[10]malignancies diagnosed during follow-up, right?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. Glyphosate appears near the bottom of
[13]this page. Do you see that line?
[14]A. I do.
[15]Q. For glyphosate, the meta hazard ratio
[16]for NHL with glyphosate exposure was what?
[17]A. 0.92.
[18]Q. I think that's for SLLs in particular.
[19]Is that right?
[20]A. Oh, I'm sorry. You were asking?
[21]Q. Let me reask the question. For NHL
[22]overall, the meta-RR --
[23]A. I'm sorry. 0.9.
[24]Q. Hold up. Let me just finish the
[25]question and then you answer. Okay?
  Page 101
[1]A. Sure.
[2]Q. For glyphosate, what was the meta hazard
[3]ratio for NHL in Leon 2019?
[4]A. 0.95.
[5]Q. What was the 95 percent confidence
[6]interval?
[7]A. .77 to 1.18.
[8]Q. That was based on how many cases of
[9]agricultural workers exposed to glyphosate?
[10]A. With non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[11]Q. With non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall,
[12]right?
[13]A. 1, 131.
[14]Q. For CLL/SLL, what was the hazard ratio
[15]for glyphosate exposure and the development of cancer
[16]in Leon 2019?
[17]A. .925.
[18]Q. What was the 95 percent confidence
[19]interval?
[20]A. .69 to 1.24.
[21]Q. How many patients were exposed to
[22]glyphosate in Leon 2019 who developed CLL or SLL?
[23]A. 252.
[24]Q. The results in Leon 2019 were also not
[25]statistically significant for a relationship between
  Page 102
[1]glyphosate and SLL, right?
[2]A. Correct. Again, those numbers fall
[3]within the confidence interval.
[4]Q. The hazard ratio for SLL in particular
[5]that we were just talking about was .92, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. Does that mean that folks that were
[8]exposed to glyphosate were 8 percent less likely to
[9]develop cancer than folks who were not exposed?
[10]A. Again, within -- so you have hazard
[11]ratios for a reason, which says those kind of numbers
[12]are not very reliable. They could float anywhere
[13]between .69 -- excuse me. Yeah, between -- sorry.
[14]This is a very dense table. Between .69 and 1.24.
[15]Q. When the 95 percent confidence --
[16]A. At a 95 percent chance that this is not
[17]by chance.
[18]Q. When a 95 percent confidence interval
[19]includes 1.0, you cannot say there is any difference
[20]between the exposed and unexposed groups, correct?
[21]A. You cannot say.
[22]Q. If you'll go back to your report with me
[23]for a moment, I think that you also speak about the
[24]Andreotti 2018 paper that's Reference 22 in your
[25]reference list.
  Page 103
[1]A. Is that on Page 8?
[2]Q. I see the reference on Page 10. I think
[3]your discussion of it is on Page 8.
[4]A. On Page 8.
[5]Q. Yes.
[6]A. Right.
[7]Q. Andreotti 2018 is another paper that
[8]looked at SLL and Roundup exposure. Do you recall
[9]that?
[10]A. Yes, I think so.
[11]Q. Do you remember any of the numbers there
[12]or would you have to go back and look at them?
[13]A. I don't. You'd have to pull that paper
[14]for me.
[15]Q. Sure.
[16](Deposition Exhibit 7 was marked.)
[17]Q. Exhibit 7 to your deposition is
[18]Andreotti 2018, right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. Do you -- we'll turn to the table in a
[21]minute, but if you'll just look at the abstract with
[22]me for a moment. Are you there?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. Do you see under the abstract it gives
[25]results, including the number of folks included in the
  Page 104
[1]study that used glyphosate?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. Andreotti 2018 included 44,932 people
[4]who used Roundup or glyphosate, correct?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. Andreotti 2018 is a prospective cohort
[7]study, right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. If you'll turn with me to Page 513.
[10]A. I'm sorry. Did you say 13?
[11]Q. 513, yes. Are you there?
[12]A. Yep.
[13]Q. Table 2 in Andreotti 2018 gives the
[14]association between Roundup use and development of
[15]cancer for a number of different cancers, right?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. One of those cancers is NHL overall,
[18]right?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. The association between Roundup use and
[21]NHL overall in Andreotti 2018 was statistically null,
[22]correct?
[23]A. Right. The relative risk of .83 to .88
[24]falls within the confidence intervals.
[25]Q. Right. The point estimates for NHL and
  Page 105
[1]Roundup use in Andreotti 2018 were actually below 1,
[2]but the 95 percent confidence intervals includes 1,
[3]correct?
[4]A. Correct, correct.
[5]Q. For CLL/SLL, do you see that there are
[6]also relative risks provided for exposure to Roundup
[7]and development of those cancers?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. For Q1 in Andreotti, the relative risk
[10]was .75 for SLL/CLL with a 95 confidence interval of
[11].4 to 1.4, right?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. That was 28 cases exposed to glyphosate,
[14]correct?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. Q2 was 26 cases exposed to glyphosate,
[17]right?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. Relative risk was .76 with a
[20]nonsignificant confidence interval, right?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. Q3 was 26 people exposed to glyphosate,
[23]right?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Relative risk was .9 with a 95 percent
  Page 106
[1]confidence interval of .5 to 1.62, correct?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. Q4 was 27 people exposed to glyphosate,
[4]right?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. Relative risk was .87 with a
[7]nonsignificant confidence interval, right?
[8]A. Again, they fall within the confidence
[9]interval.
[10]Q. There were -- I think we just walked
[11]through this -- 28 plus 26 plus 26 plus 27 cases
[12]exposed to glyphosate in Andreotti 2018 who then
[13]developed CLL/SLL, right?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. That's over a hundred, correct?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. I want to see if we can just summarize
[18]the SLL data we just walked through. Okay? Is that
[19]all right?
[20]A. Sure.
[21]Q. Pahwa 2018 looked at SLL in Roundup
[22]users, right?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. There was no significant association,
[25]right?
  Page 107
[1]A. Right. It falls within the confidence
[2]intervals.
[3]Q. Chang 2016 looked at SLL in Roundup
[4]users, right?
[5]A. Right.
[6]Q. There was no statistically significant
[7]association in that study, right?
[8]A. Again, with the same caveat as to
[9]definition.
[10]Q. Leon 2019 looked at SLL in Roundup
[11]users, right?
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. There was no statistically significant
[14]association between SLL and Roundup in Leon 2019,
[15]right?
[16]A. Same caveat.
[17]Q. But the answer to my question is yes,
[18]there was no statistically significant association,
[19]right?
[20]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[21]A. Yes, the -- I forget which exact
[22]statistical tool they used, whether it was hazard or
[23]relative risk or odds ratio, but it fell within the
[24]confidence intervals.
[25]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Andreotti 2018 also
  Page 108
[1]looked at SLL in Roundup users, right?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. The relative risks for SLL and Roundup
[4]use all fell within the 95 percent confidence
[5]intervals all showing no association, correct?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. Are there any other data of which you
[8]are aware for SLL specifically in Roundup users?
[9]A. Beyond those, I am not, no.
[10]Q. Are you aware of any study that shows a
[11]statistically significant increased risk for SLL with
[12]Roundup exposure?
[13]A. With the caveats that I've now exposed
[14]several times, no.
[15]Q. In your report, I think you also say
[16]there was a recent meta-analysis that reported no
[17]overall increased risk for NHL or CLL. Do you
[18]remember saying that or do you want to look at that
[19]text?
[20]A. Let me look at that text.
[21]Q. Sure. Go with me to Page 8 of your
[22]report.
[23]A. Okay.
[24]Q. Do you see where you say, "A recent
[25]meta-analysis also reported no overall increased risk
  Page 109
[1]for NHL or CLL from glyphosate"?
[2]A. Correct. That's Reference 26.
[3]Q. Reference 26 is to Donato 2020, right?
[4]A. Donato 2020.
[5]Q. You don't provide the meta hazard ratio
[6]or meta relative risk from Donato 2020 for either NHL
[7]overall or CLL/SLL, right?
[8]A. I considered this -- this is published
[9]in an Italian journal, quite a low-quality
[10]publication.
[11]Q. You considered the quality of journals
[12]where studies were published when you were relying on
[13]them or evaluating them; is that right?
[14]A. Correct. If they're published --
[15]there's a metric called the impact factor, which is
[16]somewhat of a rough estimate of how publications are
[17]viewed in the field. This Medicina del Lavoro, which
[18]is Italian for work, I could not find such a metric.
[19]It may exist, but I could not find it.
[20]Q. Are you familiar with the Journal of the
[21]National Cancer Institute, JNCI?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Do you consider that to be a reputable
[24]journal?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 110
[1]Q. If you'll -- so if I'm understanding you
[2]correctly, you were not impressed with the journal in
[3]which Donato 2020 was published, right?
[4]A. No.
[5]Q. For that reason, you did not rely
[6]heavily on it, but you did still include it in your
[7]references in your report about Mr. Chapman, correct?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. The -- let's see if we can do this
[10]without marking it, and if I need to hand you a copy
[11]of the journal article, I'm very happy to. Okay?
[12]A. Okay.
[13]Q. I will represent to you that the meta
[14]relative risk for CLL in Donato 2020 was .85. Do you
[15]have any recollection of that?
[16]A. I do not.
[17]Q. Okay.
[18](Deposition Exhibit 8 was marked.)
[19]Q. Exhibit 8 to your deposition is Donato
[20]2020.
[21]A. Thank you.
[22]Q. Is that right?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. If you'll go with me to Page 66. And
[25]tell me when you're there.
  Page 111
[1]A. You said 66?
[2]Q. I did.
[3]A. Okay.
[4]Q. There's a discussion of subtype data for
[5]NHL in Donato 2020 that begins at the bottom of Page
[6]66. Do you see that?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. They mention several different subtypes,
[9]right?
[10]A. Right.
[11]Q. Donato 2020 included information for
[12]CLL/SLL, correct?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. Now, at times in this deposition, I've
[15]referred to CLL/SLL, and I don't know that I've always
[16]put a slash in the middle of those, but when we're
[17]talking about that, you know that we're talking about
[18]CLL/SLL, right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. The discussion of CLL/SLL continues on
[21]Page 68. Do you see that?
[22]A. I do.
[23]Q. In Donato 2020, the meta-RR for SLL was
[24].85, right?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 112
[1]Q. The 95 percent confidence interval was
[2]0.2 to 1.49, correct?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. Table 1 of Donato 2020 gives a list of
[5]the studies that these authors included. Do you see
[6]that?
[7]A. I do.
[8]MR. DIAMOND: What was the number of the
[9]table you said?
[10]MS. ROSS: Table 1.
[11]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) I think you said in your
[12]report that Donato 2020 was limited, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. One of the things that you point to is
[15]the underlying methodologic issues in the initial
[16]studies, right?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. Those are the issues we talked about a
[19]minute ago, right?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. Including recall bias and the case
[22]control studies, correct?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. One other limitation of Donato 2020 is
[25]that it does not appear to include Pahwa, right?
  Page 113
[1]A. It does not include Pahwa.
[2]Q. Are you aware of any other, better meta
[3]analyses published in 2021, for example?
[4]A. In 2021, I am not.
[5]Q. Have you performed a review of the
[6]literature to see what has been published in the last
[7]year on Roundup and NHL use?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. Have you read the Kabat 2021 study?
[10]A. That does not sound familiar.
[11]Q. Have you read the Boffetta 2021 study?
[12]A. That does not sound familiar. If I did
[13]not cite it in my references, I did not see those in
[14]a --
[15]Q. Let's just make sure we have a clear
[16]record on this then because they aren't cited in your
[17]references list. Is that all right?
[18]A. Sure.
[19]Q. You are not relying on Kabat 2021 for
[20]any of your opinions in this case, right?
[21]A. If it's not in my reference list, then
[22]it's not something I found on PubMed.
[23]Q. Can you confirm that Kabat 2021 is not
[24]on the 31 papers that you list just so that we're
[25]clear?
  Page 114
[1]A. How do you spell that?
[2]Q. Kabat.
[3]A. I do not see that.
[4]Q. Do you see Boffetta 2021 on your
[5]reference list?
[6]MR. DIAMOND: How do you spell Boffetta?
[7]MS. ROSS: Boffetta.
[8]A. I do not see that.
[9]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) If there were more recent
[10]studies published in better journals looking at
[11]whether Roundup use is associated with NHL, would you
[12]want to look at those?
[13]A. Definitely.
[14]Q. If there were more recent studies that
[15]included all of the data, including Pahwa 2019, when
[16]they look at Roundup and NHL use, would you want to
[17]look at those?
[18]A. Definitely.
[19]Q. You cite Dr. Weisenburger's 2021
[20]publication in your report, I think, at the bottom of
[21]Page 7 and to Page 8.
[22]A. I'm sorry. What page?
[23]Q. Very last sentence on Page 7.
[24]A. Okay.
[25]Q. You cite Dr. Weisenburger's 2021
  Page 115
[1]publication in your report, right?
[2]A. Correct. That's Reference 19?
[3]Q. Right. Is Dr. Weisenburger on the
[4]editorial board for that publication?
[5]A. I do not know. For Clinical Lymphoma
[6]Myeloma Leukemia?
[7]Q. Correct.
[8]A. I do not know.
[9]Q. What's the impact factor of that
[10]journal?
[11]A. I don't know.
[12]Q. Would it matter to you what the impact
[13]factor of that journal is?
[14]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[15]A. To some extent. If I can't find them at
[16]all, it worries me. There are many journals where
[17]people essentially pay to publish. There are others
[18]where people -- they're, frankly, called predatory
[19]journals. Ones that have impact factor have a higher
[20]level of reliability, but they are not without their
[21]problems as well. It's -- again, it's not a black and
[22]white with somebody -- but there is sort of general
[23]gradations of reliability in the field.
[24]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Would it influence your
[25]opinion or the weight that you put on
  Page 116
[1]Dr. Weisenburger's publication if he is on the
[2]editorial board of that journal?
[3]MR. DIAMOND: Form.
[4]A. I'd have to think about that. Are you
[5]suggesting that he accepted his own paper for
[6]publication, that that would be the confounding issue?
[7]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Let me ask a more general
[8]question. All right? Do you -- you -- I didn't --
[9]you gave us a list earlier of the general causation
[10]experts for the Plaintiffs that you relied on in this
[11]case, right?
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. You did not mention Dr. Weisenburger's
[14]general causation expert report, did you?
[15]A. I'm trying to remember if I read that in
[16]one of the previous cases. I cannot recall.
[17]Q. You can't recall whether you read
[18]Dr. Weisenburger's report; is that right?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. Do you recall that Dr. Weisenburger is
[21]an expert for the Plaintiffs in this litigation?
[22]A. I do not recall that, no.
[23]Q. Do you think that Dr. Weisenburger's
[24]published review is unbiased?
[25]A. I don't think anybody's review is
  Page 117
[1]unbiased. I think there are gradations of bias, some
[2]of which are very severe and some of which are less
[3]so.
[4]Q. What are some of the more severe
[5]gradations of bias?
[6]A. I think people that pay to publish,
[7]ghostwriting, people that have had -- where people
[8]have had manuscripts written for them by companies and
[9]put their names on it, that's pretty egregious. Those
[10]would be some of the worst examples. And then less so
[11]are just examples of, you know, poor techniques or
[12]overinterpretation or abuse of statistics. Finding a
[13]completely unbiased publication of medical literature
[14]is difficult, so it's a matter of degrees.
[15]Q. Why is it that in your view folks who
[16]pay to publish are one of the more severe grades of
[17]bias in publication?
[18]A. There's no -- in that case, there's no
[19]even attempted objective peer review, where people who
[20]are experts in that area have critiqued the paper for
[21]both methodologies and conclusions.
[22]Q. Why is it that overinterpretation or
[23]abuse of statistics in your view are a source of bias
[24]in publication?
[25]A. I think, you know, publications, like
  Page 118
[1]everything we do in science, should be geared towards
[2]trying to understand the truth as best we can.
[3]It's -- the truth is very messy, and statistics help
[4]support that, but they don't define it. And as I've
[5]described for you, I have concerns around very simple
[6]things, like drawing a very strict line between saying
[7]something is statistically meaningful or not
[8]meaningful using that PO 0.05. And I think that's a
[9]view that's pretty reasonably widely shared by
[10]statisticians.
[11]MS. ROSS: Let's go off the record for a
[12]moment and see if we can wrap this up. Okay?
[13]MR. DIAMOND: Sure.
[14]THE DEPONENT: Sure.
[15]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record
[16]at 10:48.
[17](Recess taken.)
[18]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record at
[19]10:54.
[20]Q. (BY MS. ROSS) Dr. Smith, before forming
[21]your opinion that Roundup causes NHL, you did not
[22]review Kabat 2021, correct?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. Before forming your opinion that Roundup
[25]causes NHL, you did not review Boffetta 2021, correct?
  Page 119
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. In your report at Page 9, you speak
[3]about risk factors for NHL, and actually -- strike
[4]that. Go to Page 5 of your report, if you would,
[5]please. In your report in Mr. Chapman's case, you
[6]give a list of risk factors for NHL, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. You describe those as currently defined
[9]risk factors for all types of NHL, right?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. One thing you list as a defined risk
[12]factor for NHL is a weakened immune system, right?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. How does a weakened immune system
[15]contribute to the development of lymphoma?
[16]A. Presumably -- again, I don't think
[17]anybody knows for sure, but presumably it goes back to
[18]that immune surveillance notion, that the immune
[19]system is constantly looking for cancer cells and then
[20]destroying them before they can turn into a full-blown
[21]cancer.
[22]Q. Chronic immune stimulation is also a
[23]defined risk factor for NHL, correct?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. How does chronic immune stimulation
  Page 120
[1]cause lymphoma to develop?
[2]A. So presumably it's more of a constant
[3]growth stimulus to tell the cells divide, divide,
[4]divide, and then, as you pointed out, they may
[5]accumulate more of those mutations that can lead to
[6]turning into a full-blown cancer cell.
[7]Q. Chronic immune stimulation means that
[8]your lymphocytes are more active and more actively
[9]dividing, correct?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. Each time those lymphocytes divide,
[12]there's an opportunity for mutation errors to occur,
[13]correct?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. That's one mechanism by which chronic
[16]immune stimulation includes a risk for increased risk
[17]of NHL, correct?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. You talk specifically about several
[20]different chronic infections that can cause chronic
[21]immune stimulation in your report, right?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Hepatitis C can cause chronic immune
[24]stimulation, right?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 121
[1]Q. Hepatitis B can cause chronic immune
[2]stimulation, right?
[3]A. Yeah.
[4]Q. HTLV-1 can cause chronic immune
[5]stimulation, right?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. You also say other chronic infections
[8]can lead to lymphoma development. Do you see that?
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. Are there any other infections that you
[11]would put in the category of causing NHL?
[12]A. There's one called Chlamydia that people
[13]can get in the eye, for example, and elsewhere.
[14]There's H. pylori, which causes a type of lymphoma in
[15]the stomach. So there are -- and these are all quite
[16]possibly just the tip of the iceberg of what we know.
[17]So I think there's probably many, many different
[18]viruses, other organisms that can do the same.
[19]Q. Does hepatitis C cause all types of
[20]lymphoma?
[21]A. So many of these are limited by --
[22]again, the same thing we were talking about before
[23]with statistics, by numbers, so the things we don't
[24]know, we don't know. It's easier -- there are things
[25]we do see a strong association. So hepatitis C is
  Page 122
[1]more associated with certain types of lymphoma than
[2]others.
[3]Q. What types of lymphoma does hepatitis C
[4]cause, in your opinion?
[5]A. One of the more common ones that comes
[6]from -- that I think the evidence is the strongest for
[7]this chronic inflammation is called marginal zone
[8]lymphoma. That's like the H. pylori and others. That
[9]type of lymphoma seems to, for whatever reason, have a
[10]propensity to be associated with chronic antigen
[11]stimulation.
[12]Q. Do you consider hepatitis C to be an
[13]established risk factor for DLBCL?
[14]A. I think the evidence is somewhat
[15]compelling for that.
[16]Q. If you were treating a patient who had
[17]DLBCL, you would consider hepatitis C to be a risk
[18]factor if that was part of their history?
[19]A. I would consider it, yes.
[20]Q. In your list of defined risk factors for
[21]all types of NHL, you also include breast implants.
[22]Do you see that?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. Do breast implants cause NHL
[25]specifically or a particular type?
  Page 123
[1]A. No, a particular type.
[2]Q. What type?
[3]A. I think perhaps I could have been
[4]clearer in the term "all." It sounds like what you've
[5]interpreted that, which I can see now, is I'm listing
[6]risk factors for -- these are common risk factors for
[7]every type of lymphoma. What I was referring to is if
[8]you take the whole basket of lymphoma, these are risk
[9]factors for different subsets of lymphoma within that
[10]basket.
[11]Q. Thank you. I think that's where some of
[12]my confusion was coming from.
[13]A. Yes. Sorry. I should have been clear
[14]with my language.
[15]Q. Let me see if we can clarify some of
[16]this a little bit --
[17]A. Sure.
[18]Q. -- and see if that helps.
[19]A. Sure.
[20]Q. Are breast implants a known risk factor
[21]for SLL?
[22]A. Not that I know of.
[23]Q. Are -- withdrawn. Is obesity a known
[24]risk factor for SLL?
[25]A. Not that I know of.
  Page 124
[1]Q. Positive family history is a risk factor
[2]for SLL, correct?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. A weakened immune system is a risk
[5]factor for any type of NHL, including SLL, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. Autoimmune diseases, do you consider
[8]those to be a risk factor for all types of NHL or just
[9]specific subtypes?
[10]A. So, again, without going down a deep
[11]rabbit hole, I think there are things that we have
[12]stronger proof for association, and then there are
[13]things that we definitely worry about. So what I've
[14]listed for CLL/SLL are the ones that I think there's
[15]strong evidence for it. These are widely accepted
[16]risk factors, but I included all of the other risk
[17]factors in NHL because it won't surprise me at all in
[18]the fullness of time if one or more of those also
[19]become identified for SLL since SLL is, in general,
[20]part of the lymphoma family. They share -- they all
[21]share some similar biology.
[22]So I think, again, it's just like we
[23]were talking about with the epidemiologic data.
[24]There's gradations of strength of evidence, and so in
[25]order to try to be comprehensive, particularly because
  Page 125
[1]I was simply trying to exclude everything else that I
[2]could think of that one could possibly construe as
[3]being causative for Mr. Chapman.
[4]Q. Exposure to pesticides is a risk factor
[5]for CLL/SLL, right?
[6]A. There's reasonably strong evidence, and
[7]if you go to many of the typical lymphoma or SLL
[8]sites, that frequently gets cited as a, you know --
[9]strong evidence in favor of being associated.
[10]Q. Do you consider exposure to pesticides
[11]to be a risk factor for SLL?
[12]A. I do.
[13]Q. Do you consider exposure to pesticides
[14]other than Roundup to be a risk factor for SLL?
[15]A. Very likely.
[16]Q. Which pesticides do you consider to be
[17]risk factors for SLL?
[18]A. I do not know.
[19]Q. Which pesticides do you consider to be
[20]risk factors for NHL more generally?
[21]A. I don't know. That's outside of my area
[22]of expertise.
[23]Q. You have not reviewed the literature to
[24]see what pesticides other than Roundup increase the
[25]risk of NHL, fair?
  Page 126
[1]A. Right, I have not specifically looked at
[2]those.
[3]Q. You have not reviewed any literature on
[4]what other pesticides may be associated with SLL in
[5]particular; is that fair?
[6]A. Well, I think many of the papers,
[7]including the ones that you've provided back to me,
[8]include looking at a number of different pesticides,
[9]and I just cannot tell you that I paid any particular
[10]focus to others outside of glyphosate in those papers.
[11]Q. Sitting here today, you don't have an
[12]opinion on whether any other particular pesticide
[13]besides Roundup increases the risk of NHL, right?
[14]A. I have an opinion that I think it's
[15]quite likely that other pesticides can contribute to
[16]it. I do not have the expertise or the knowledge to
[17]know which specifically and what the weight of that
[18]evidence is.
[19]Q. Okay. I think there were a few things
[20]in that answer, so let me break that one up. Okay?
[21]A. Okay.
[22]Q. Your opinion is that it's quite likely
[23]that pesticides other than Roundup can contribute to
[24]SLL, correct?
[25]A. Correct.
  Page 127
[1]Q. It's also your opinion that pesticides
[2]other than Roundup can contribute to NHL, correct?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. You do not have the expertise or the
[5]knowledge to know specifically which pesticides
[6]increase the risk of NHL, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Same is true for SLL, correct?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. You would defer to others on which
[11]pesticides besides Roundup are associated with an
[12]increased risk of NHL or SLL?
[13]A. Right, or I would -- I would try to go
[14]back and study it, as I believe I have with
[15]glyphosate.
[16]Q. And sitting here today, in terms of the
[17]opinions you plan to offer at trial, you have not done
[18]that study of other pesticides to determine which
[19]other pesticides are associated with an increased
[20]risk, correct?
[21]A. Correct, other than, again, casually
[22]reading them as part of some of these larger studies
[23]that we've referenced.
[24]Q. So I guess I'm confused about something
[25]here, and maybe you can help me understand it. Let me
  Page 128
[1]show you where I am. Page 6 of your report has a
[2]section that says Exclusion of Potential Causative
[3]Factors for SLL in Mr. Chapman. Do you see that?
[4]A. I do.
[5]Q. One thing that you list is smoking
[6]history, right?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. Do you consider smoking to be a risk
[9]factor for SLL?
[10]A. I consider smoking to be a risk factor
[11]for just about every disease that I can think of.
[12]Q. In your opinion, smoking is a risk
[13]factor for many diseases, including NHL; is that
[14]right?
[15]A. I will be surprised if it's not
[16]ultimately shown that smoking and the chemicals from
[17]inhaling smoke are not causative of lymphoma in some
[18]cases.
[19]Q. You also list breast implants. That's
[20]Number 9 on your exclusion of potential causative
[21]factors.
[22]A. Right.
[23]Q. As we've just discussed, so far as you
[24]know, breast implants have no known association with
[25]SLL, correct?
  Page 129
[1]A. Correct. I think, though, maybe where I
[2]could clarify, I think in -- it sounds like in your
[3]mind no proven association means it cannot happen. In
[4]my mind, again, evidence comes in a --
[5](Sound interruption)
[6]THE DEPONENT: Is that okay?
[7]A. -- in a gradation of strengths, and that
[8]evidence comes from many, many different places, in
[9]vitro studies, from epidemiologic studies, from
[10]personal observation. And I believe my job as a
[11]professional is to synthesize all that together,
[12]hopefully in an objective way, and try to think about
[13]is this a potential association, a cause, et cetera.
[14]So when I say -- when I've listed all of
[15]the lymphoma causes like breast implants, they have
[16]not been proven yet, but I will not be at all
[17]surprised if when the day comes when we have longer
[18]periods of study and we have more people studied that
[19]there will be individuals that develop SLL around a
[20]breast implant, because I think that's a form of
[21]chronic antigen stimulation and probably leakage of
[22]some mutagenic chemical.
[23]So even though I'm not aware of SLL
[24]being clearly associated with breast implants right
[25]now, I won't be at all surprised if the day comes that
  Page 130
[1]a case report or five case reports. And it's the
[2]same -- if you go back to -- just to use this as an
[3]example, up until several years ago, there wasn't a
[4]known association between breast implants and lymphoma
[5]at all. That just occurred through a series of
[6]observations and case reports that grew over time.
[7]So if you'd asked me prior to that could
[8]a breast implant or any type of implant have led to
[9]lymphoma, I'd say -- I'd be worried about that, and I
[10]wasn't surprised that breast implants could do that.
[11]I won't be surprised if there's other types of
[12]lymphoma that comes from breast implants, and I won't
[13]be surprised if there's other types of lymphoma that
[14]come from other implants.
[15]Q. All right. Dr. Smith, that was another
[16]long answer, so let's see if we can simplify it a
[17]little bit. Okay?
[18]What I understand you to be saying is
[19]there are some established risk factors for certain
[20]types of lymphoma, right?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. For some of those risk factors, you
[23]would not be surprised if in the future there were
[24]more data suggesting an association with other types
[25]of lymphoma too, correct?
  Page 131
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. But for some of those risk factors,
[3]sitting here today, the only data that we have shows a
[4]relationship between a particular risk factor and a
[5]particular type of lymphoma, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. Different types of lymphoma are
[8]different diseases, correct?
[9]A. They have differences, and they have
[10]similarities.
[11]Q. Do you consider different types of
[12]lymphoma to be different diseases with potentially
[13]different biological causes and, in some cases,
[14]different risk factors?
[15]A. So you're going to send me down a real
[16]rabbit hole now because I personally believe every
[17]cancer is different and every person is different.
[18]Q. Let me stop you there then, and we'll do
[19]this so that we don't blow up the entire rest of your
[20]day. New question. You believe every cancer is
[21]different and every person is different, correct?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. That is reflected in much of your
[24]research on personalized medicine and the future of
[25]treatments for cancer, right?
  Page 132
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. In your view, different cancers are
[3]different diseases with different causes, correct?
[4]A. Correct, and my --
[5]Q. Why is that?
[6]A. Because, again, what -- many people when
[7]they look at these things, they see strict boxes.
[8]They see yes and no. They see black and white. And I
[9]personally don't think nature works that way. I think
[10]these cancers are very complicated, and we tend to
[11]lump them together because they have certain shared
[12]features; and the most important one is a lump of
[13]cancers will respond to a certain treatment, but we
[14]know from our practice and history that some people
[15]respond to the treatment and some don't. And so that
[16]lumping has failed.
[17]So the premise of personalized medicine
[18]is that we're trying to capture what those differences
[19]are a lot more effectively than we have in the past so
[20]that we can tailor specific treatments to people, and
[21]I think the same thing likely happens with their
[22]biology. There are going to be similarities, but
[23]there are going to be differences as well.
[24]I tried to keep that short.
[25]Q. You did great.
  Page 133
[1]MS. ROSS: Dr. Smith, those are all of
[2]the questions I have for you pending questions from
[3]your counsel.
[4]MR. DIAMOND: I have just a few.
[5]THE DEPONENT: Sure.
[6]EXAMINATION
[7]BY MR. DIAMOND:
[8]Q. We can probably just plow through them
[9]in a few minutes, but if you want to take a break, we
[10]can also take a break.
[11]A. No, no, I'd love to keep going, get back
[12]to work.
[13]Q. Has anything that's been discussed today
[14]other than maybe a typo, correction in your report
[15]changed any of your opinions in your report?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. All right. And so it's still your
[18]opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty
[19]that Mr. Chapman's use of Roundup was a causative
[20]factor in his developing NHL or SLL?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. Okay. In your report, you talk about
[23]prognosis for people diagnosed with SLL, and you
[24]discussed that in your deposition today. Is what you
[25]discussed about the prognosis, is that also -- I'm
  Page 134
[1]assuming also applies to Mr. Chapman, correct?
[2]A. Sorry. Could you explain?
[3]Q. Yeah. What I'm trying to find out is
[4]what is Mr. Chapman's prognosis and is it reflected in
[5]your report or is it something slightly different.
[6]A. I don't know that I commented on his
[7]prognosis -- his personal prognosis in my report. I
[8]would say his -- again, I don't have the most recent
[9]medical records, but if it's -- he has not had
[10]treatment, his disease has not progressed, then he's
[11]demonstrated that so far he has an indolent lymphoma.
[12]The problems are there's about a 5 to 10 percent
[13]chance overall -- the biggest problem is that this
[14]will transform into a very aggressive lymphoma.
[15]That's called a Richter's transformation, and it can
[16]turn into a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, like a DLBCL, or a
[17]Hodgkin's disease. If it turned into the
[18]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, those are difficult to treat.
[19]His prognosis would change dramatically.
[20]Q. Back in 2008, Mr. Chapman had a
[21]tonsillectomy. Are you aware of that?
[22]A. Because you told me.
[23]Q. Yes. And it was in his records, I
[24]think.
[25]MS. ROSS: I'd object to form.
  Page 135
[1]A. I did not see those -- that record.
[2]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Okay. Well, then I
[3]apologize because I should have -- at least I have it,
[4]so I apologize I didn't give it to you.
[5]MS. ROSS: So --
[6]A. It's possible I missed. There were
[7]quite a voluminous amount of medical records.
[8]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Sure. My question
[9]really is that in July of 2008, he had a
[10]tonsillectomy. Do you consider the tonsillectomy to
[11]be related to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[12]MS. ROSS: Counsel, I'm just going to
[13]object to form and foundation --
[14]MR. DIAMOND: That's fine.
[15]MS. ROSS: -- since Dr. Smith has not
[16]seen any records related to this.
[17]A. Yes, and so --
[18]MR. DIAMOND: I have a record. I can
[19]show it to him. I believe it was provided to him. I
[20]can show it to him because I have it here with me. I
[21]can show it to you as well.
[22]MS. ROSS: I will stand by my foundation
[23]objection because Dr. Smith didn't review these
[24]records or form any opinions related to this during
[25]his review of this case and they're not included in
  Page 136
[1]his expert report.
[2]MR. DIAMOND: All right. So your form
[3]objection, I understand.
[4]MS. ROSS: Okay.
[5]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) And I don't want to
[6]spend a lot of time on this, but in terms of
[7]Mr. Chapman's tonsillectomy, do you have an
[8]understanding as to whether it was related in any
[9]way to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[10]MS. ROSS: Object to form and
[11]foundation.
[12]A. Yes, again, is it feasible I can review?
[13]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Yes, please.
[14]MR. DIAMOND: And I'll give -- I only
[15]brought one copy, so I apologize, but I'll mark it and
[16]I'll give it to you before I ask him any questions, if
[17]you want to see it.
[18]MS. ROSS: Well, so I think that we are
[19]just going to move to strike since this was not
[20]disclosed, but that's fine.
[21]MR. DIAMOND: That's fine, whatever.
[22]MS. ROSS: Okay. I'll take a quick look
[23]at that.
[24]THE DEPONENT: Sure.
[25]MS. ROSS: Thanks, Doctor.
  Page 137
[1]A. Should I answer?
[2]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) You can answer it, and
[3]then we'll address it after the fact.
[4]A. So --
[5]Q. Wait, wait, wait. Let her look at it,
[6]and then we'll go ahead.
[7]A. So --
[8]MR. DIAMOND: I don't know what number
[9]we should mark that as an exhibit, but we can. Do you
[10]know, Court Reporter?
[11]THE COURT REPORTER: It's Number 9.
[12]MR. DIAMOND: All right. So we'll mark
[13]that as Number 9.
[14](Deposition Exhibit 9 was marked.)
[15]A. So should I comment?
[16]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Yes, you can answer
[17]the question now, if you remember it.
[18]A. So the statement from Dr. McLaughlin is
[19]that he had a false positive PET scan and a
[20]tonsillectomy because of that. So in -- PET scans are
[21]widely used to follow people with lymphoma. They are
[22]very good at early detection. They have a problem,
[23]though, in that they cannot distinguish inflammation
[24]or infection from cancer. And so it's not uncommon
[25]that we will do a PET scan, there will be an alarming
  Page 138
[1]uptake of PET scan reagent, which called FDG, and we
[2]cannot tell until we take that tissue or do a biopsy
[3]of that tissue out whether it's the cancer has
[4]returned or is it simply inflammation or infection.
[5]So it's not uncommon that people go through a
[6]procedure that turns out to have been essentially
[7]unnecessary for them other than it confirms the cancer
[8]is not there.
[9]Q. And so in Mr. Chapman's case, he had a
[10]test -- a PET scan that seemed to indicate that his
[11]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had spread to his tonsils,
[12]which after they were removed, they were checked, and
[13]actually the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma did not spread to
[14]his tonsils, correct?
[15]MS. ROSS: Object to form and
[16]foundation.
[17]A. The statement that it was a false
[18]positive PET implies that when they took the tonsils
[19]out and looked for lymphoma, they did not find it.
[20]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) And that would have
[21]been based upon some type of pathology that they did?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. Nonetheless, do you consider the removal
[24]of the tonsils to be related to his prior
[25]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis?
  Page 139
[1]MS. ROSS: Object to form and
[2]foundation.
[3]A. So unless somebody looked at these
[4]tonsils and thought they were something abnormal, he
[5]probably never would have gotten a PET scan to begin
[6]with, and then the interpretation that there's, you
[7]know, a positive signal there was certainly at least
[8]heightened by the fact he had lymphoma before.
[9]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) so if I understand
[10]what you're saying, is that if he hadn't had his
[11]non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before, they probably wouldn't
[12]have gone to the step of having his tonsils removed?
[13]MS. ROSS: Object to form and
[14]foundation.
[15]A. Unlikely, unless somebody looked at
[16]those tonsils and they were grossly abnormal in some
[17]way.
[18]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Since you were asked a
[19]question about the Roundup label, I had a couple of
[20]questions about that. Do you recall ever seeing a
[21]Roundup TV commercial where the Roundup man was on the
[22]commercial? It was sort of a western-themed
[23]commercial, a rawhide sounding, with a guy that was --
[24]sort a whip in the background, but there was the
[25]rawhide man, was a guy in shorts and short sleeves,
  Page 140
[1]and he was walking around spraying Roundup? Do you
[2]recall ever seeing a commercial like that?
[3]A. No.
[4]MS. ROSS: Object to the form of the
[5]question.
[6]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Would you agree that
[7]if Monsanto had TV commercials showing people using
[8]Roundup without protective equipment, such as in short
[9]sleeves or short pants, and spraying Roundup that the
[10]public would have a reasonable expectation that using
[11]Roundup without any type of protective equipment was
[12]safe?
[13]MS. ROSS: Object to form and
[14]foundation.
[15]A. Yeah, I don't know that's within my area
[16]of expertise as a doctor, but I would say just as a
[17]person that takes care of their yard, I would -- the
[18]implication of that would be it's okay.
[19]MR. DIAMOND: Okay. That's all the
[20]questions I have.
[21]MS. ROSS: Just a few very quick
[22]follow-ups, Dr. Smith.
[23]THE DEPONENT: Sure.

[1]FURTHER EXAMINATION
[2]BY MS. ROSS:
[3]Q. You mentioned Richter's transformation.
[4]Do you recall that?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. You said there was a 5 to 10 percent
[7]chance of it occurring with SLL, right?
[8]A. Within someone's lifetime.
[9]Q. There is a 90 to 95 percent chance that
[10]an SLL will not transform into a more aggressive
[11]lymphoma, correct?
[12]A. That would be the math.
[13]Q. You have not seen any evidence in any of
[14]the medical records provided to you for your review
[15]that Mr. Chapman has had his lymphoma undergo a
[16]transformation, correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. If it did, there would be treatment
[19]options available for the more aggressive lymphoma,
[20]right?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. Prior to your counsel's questions five
[23]minutes ago, had you ever reviewed medical records
[24]about Mr. Chapman's tonsillectomy that you recall?
[25]A. I had not.
  Page 142
[1]Q. Are you offering any opinions about the
[2]marketing of Roundup?
[3]A. I am not.
[4]Q. I think that you said that was outside
[5]of your expertise as a medical doctor; is that right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]MS. ROSS: Thank you, Dr. Smith.
[8]MR. DIAMOND: Just one last thing.
[9]FURTHER EXAMINATION
[10]BY MR. DIAMOND:
[11]Q. Your opinions in this case, what are
[12]they based upon?
[13]A. So, so that is a very good question, and
[14]I will try not to be too expansive, but it's -- again,
[15]it goes back to this issue of what is the weight of
[16]data, and the standard that was posed to me is in my
[17]medical opinion, to the best that I can come up with
[18]that opinion, do I think this is likely to be an
[19]etiologic agent in lymphoma in general and in SLL in
[20]particular. And in order to make that opinion, I put
[21]together all of the epidemiology, all of which, again,
[22]I consider to be flawed to some extent, but I would
[23]look at -- to me, the most effective way to look at it
[24]is not to cherry-pick individual studies, each of
[25]which is flawed in many ways, many of which are flawed
  Page 143
[1]by too few patients or many ways, but to look at them
[2]in aggregate, and the most compelling epidemiologic
[3]evidence I have seen are these forest plots, if I can
[4]show you the paper you showed me of Chang, et al.; and
[5]if you look at these, virtually every single study is
[6]on the side of positivity. And when you put all of
[7]those together, yes, you can cherry-pick each
[8]individual study and say, "Well, they did not reach,
[9]quote-unquote, statistical significance," which I've
[10]already suggested to you I think is a misleading
[11]concept, but when you look at all of them, the chances
[12]that all of them would be on the side of a positive
[13]impact on the rate and the odds of developing lymphoma
[14]I think seem quite small.
[15]If you combine that with the evidence in
[16]the lab that says it's genotoxic, creates DNA damage,
[17]which you also pointed out is causative for lymphoma,
[18]it causes oxidative stress in a number of systems.
[19]Oxidative stress is known to produce a lot of
[20]compounds inside cells that further damage DNA and
[21]further damage other processes and molecules within
[22]cells that lead to cancer. If you look at the wide
[23]range of evidence in biologic systems that it causes
[24]biologic properties, and then I think there's just
[25]sort of a common sense aspect of it which says if
  Page 144
[1]you're exposed for a long time at high level to
[2]compounds that have these biologic effects, I think
[3]it's quite likely that over time they will cause
[4]something bad to happen, which can lead to cancer.
[5]I think the other thing is that,
[6]particularly with Mr. Chapman, I think there must be
[7]some association with how much in the length of
[8]exposure and the lag time. I just think it's quite
[9]likely that people -- I'm hoping I'm one of them --
[10]that did not have much exposure to Roundup, our
[11]chances of getting cancer from that are low. Whereas
[12]someone who's constantly spraying it, it's getting on
[13]their body, they're doing this on large spreads of
[14]property year over year, I think that raises the risk.
[15]And I don't think that type of duration and extent of
[16]exposure are very well captured. It is in some of the
[17]epidemiologic studies, but not in all of them.
[18]So when you ask, after you've nicely
[19]cherry-picked a few studies which have shown no
[20]statistically significant association, why would I
[21]believe it's associated, it's because all of this in
[22]aggregate together that I think -- again, for me, I'm
[23]asked all the time in my medical practice to make
[24]decisions for which the data is not as full as I would
[25]like it to be. There's some data that's very, very
  Page 145
[1]clear. I'm not going to get into COVID and all
[2]because that's contentious, but there's some data
[3]that's extremely clear, and then there's some data
[4]that I have to use my best judgment to the best of
[5]my -- to reach what I believe is a medically valid
[6]opinion; and that's what I would say I've come to with
[7]glyphosate. I think it's the aggregate data that's
[8]biologic, epidemiologic, and then essentially just,
[9]you know, I think some common sense.
[10]MR. DIAMOND: I'm sorry.
[11]A. Sorry. I went on too long.
[12]Q. (BY MR. DIAMOND) Only because -- I'm
[13]not going to ask you a lot of questions in follow-up
[14]to THAT. You may get asked some.
[15]A. If I could just say this: When I
[16]started reading about this and learning about this, I
[17]went to my garage and threw away my Roundup.
[18]Q. Let me -- in addition to all the
[19]literature that you've reviewed, I guess it's also
[20]fair to say that your opinions are based upon your
[21]education, correct?
[22]A. As being?
[23]Q. Your education plays into --
[24]A. Supined?
[25]Q. I'm sorry. Let me start again. Your
  Page 146
[1]opinions are based in this case, at least in part, not
[2]just on the literature that you reviewed, but, as a
[3]broader category, from your education and training?
[4]A. Yes. I think that -- I think weighing
[5]evidence and getting to that vague notion of what is
[6]medically reasonable, what is that statute, I think
[7]depends a lot on how you think about evidence and how
[8]you try to critically evaluate things. And like I
[9]said, I can pick up any medical paper that was
[10]published and critique it at the end, but that doesn't
[11]mean you discard it as a potential source of what you
[12]hope will be the truth.
[13]MR. DIAMOND: Okay. I don't have any
[14]other questions.
[15]FURTHER EXAMINATION
[16]BY MS. ROSS:
[17]Q. I would just like to be clear this is
[18]not my fault.
[19]A. What's not your fault? Oh, that you're
[20]going to go on.
[21]Q. Doctor, you just gave a several-page-
[22]long answer on your review of the epidemiology and
[23]genotoxicity for Roundup. Do you recall that?
[24]A. Are you saying what I just said?
[25]Q. Yes.
  Page 147
[1]A. Or what I wrote?
[2]Q. What you just said.
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. It was a fairly long and detailed answer
[5]on epidemiology, right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. You pointed out and I think have
[8]testified previously that what you find most
[9]compelling are forest plots on all the studies of
[10]Roundup and whether they show an increased risk of
[11]NHL. Is that what you said?
[12]A. I think that's one of the many pieces of
[13]evidence that to me has, again, made me come to this
[14]opinion that I have.
[15]Q. And one of the things that you look at
[16]is are the point estimates on the side of positivity
[17]or are the point estimates on the side of negativity.
[18]Is that what you said?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. And what you mean by that is when I look
[21]at this study of Roundup and NHL, is the point
[22]estimate to the left of 1, which would be a negative
[23]study, correct?
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. Or is the point estimate to the right of
  Page 148
[1]1, which would be a positive study, correct?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. Chang 2016 was published in the year
[4]2016, right?
[5]A. Sounds like it.
[6]Q. IARC's evaluation was in 2015. Do you
[7]recall that?
[8]A. I believe that's correct.
[9]Q. Since 2016, have there been additional
[10]data published on whether Roundup is associated with
[11]NHL?
[12]A. Since 2016?
[13]Q. Yes.
[14]A. Yes, of course.
[15]Q. Many of the studies that we talked about
[16]today were published in 2019, 2020, or 2021, correct?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]MS. ROSS: I think that we will leave it
[19]there and let you go on to your next appointment,
[20]Dr. Smith.
[21]THE DEPONENT: Sure.
[22]THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record
[23]at 11:31. This marks the end of Media 2 of 2.
