[24]Q. Where are you currently employed?
[25]A. Sport Chutes Over Texas, Incorporated.
[7]
[1]Q. What's the nature of that business?
[2]A. We manufacture water sports equipment and
[3]distribute water sports equipment. That's the main
[4]umbrella. We do commercial sewing and a few other
[5]things, but, primarily, water sports equipment.
[6]Q. For how long have you been in that business?
[7]A. Since February of 1983. 33 plus years now.
[8]Q. I take it you're the owner of that business?
[9]A. I am.
[10]Q. Do you have another title?
[11]A. Just president.
[12]Q. How long have you held that position?
[13]A. Since February of '83. Always.
[14]Q. Tell me about your education.
[15]A. I have a -- attended Texas A&M University for
[16]one year and then switched to Texas Tech where I got a
[17]BA in advertising, and then I went [*5]  onto the University
[18]of Illinois and got a master of science in advertising.
[19]Q. So both of your degrees are business-related,
[20]correct?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. Do you have any degrees or training in
[23]engineering?
[24]A. No, I do not.
[25]Q. Before you started the Sport Chutes business,
[8]
[1]what did you do?
[2]A. I was in the field of advertising.
[3]Q. Working for who?
[4]A. Well, I had held a number of positions. I
[5]worked for a -- a company called Hard Hanks
[6]Communications where I was a corporate manager. Then I
[7]went to Southland Corporation and worked for their
[8]wholly-owned advertising agency called the Stanford
[9]Agency, and from there, I went to Tracy Lock Advertising
[10]and was in account service.
[11]Q. Before starting Sport Chutes in 1983, were you
[12]involved in any businesses related to the water sports
[13]industry?
[14]A. Not any businesses. Just leisurely. We were
[15]avid boaters. Rabid boaters.
[16]Q. When you say we, who are you referring to?
[17]A. Myself and my ex-husband.
[18]Q. And Mr. Clark's --
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. -- who's sitting next to me? [*6] 
[21]A. Right. It was our thing to do on the weekends.
[22]We loved boating.
[23]Q. So boating was something you did for
[24]recreation, but prior to Sport Chutes, you had never
[25]worked in the water sports industry; is that correct?
[9]
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. How did you get into the parasailing business?
[3]A. Well, it was my idea. I saw a husband and wife
[4]selling a -- a -- had a little booth at a boat show in
[5]San Antonio. I was down there on business, saw them
[6]selling the parasails, and my ex's birthday was coming
[7]up, and I thought it would be cool because maybe he'd
[8]like to have a parasail for his birthday. Initially,
[9]that's what I was thinking.
[10]And I know that his dad is a pilot, and he
[11]always had an interest in flying, and so I felt well,
[12]let's just kind of combine the two. We'd seen them down
[13]at the lake. I thought that might be kind of fun, and
[14]then I started thinking about it, and the girl that was
[15]selling them said well, you know, you could distribute
[16]them for me, and the idea blossomed from there to start
[17]a business, and the rest is history.
[18]Q. Where were you working [*7]  at the time?
[19]A. I was at Tracy Lock.
[20]Q. Where was Mr. Clark working at the time?
[21]A. I can't recall. Maybe Chemical Express
[22]Carriers. His background's trucking.
[23]Q. At some point in time, did you start a business
[24]with Mr. Clark together?
[25]A. Pretty much when I got home from going to the
[10]
[1]boat show, it was my idea, and he thought I might as
[2]well say we're sending men to the moon. He thought I
[3]was kind of crazy, but he went along with it, and that's
[4]how we started the business.
[5]It looked like there was a need in the
[6]market in Dallas to sell this, and nobody did, and I
[7]thought gee, it'd be fun and combine the love of our
[8]life to make some money and have a good time. Seemed
[9]like the thing to do.
[10]Q. Back in 1983, the both of you owned the
[11]business together?
[12]A. Correct. Well, in Texas, we were married so
[13]it's community property anyway.
[14]Q. In the beginning of the business, did Sport
[15]Chutes manufacture any equipment?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. What was the nature of the business at the
[18]beginning?
[19]A. At the beginning, we were in kind of [*8]  a quasi
[20]partnership with the gal in San Antonio who was in --
[21]bringing in the chute made in California. She had the
[22]distributorship for Texas, and so we kind of drew an
[23]imaginary line, and we said everything in North Texas
[24]would come to me on her referal, and everything, if I
[25]sold something in South Texas, would go to her on
[11]
[1]referral, and she needed help to sell her product in
[2]Texas, and so we made an agreement that we would work
[3]together.
[4]Q. That particular product, was that for
[5]commercial operators or for recreational users?
[6]A. It was used commercially, but the -- the whole
[7]industry was in infancy at that point because, at that
[8]point in 1983, everybody was taken off from the beach
[9]and so parasailing has evolved over the years, but back
[10]then, there weren't very many commercial operations in
[11]existence, and there was only two chute choices. That
[12]one and then another one made up in the East Coast.
[13]Q. What were the names of those --
[14]A. Power Chute.
[15]Q. -- companies?
[16]A. -- was the one from California, and the other
[17]one was Pioneer Parasails.
[18]Q. [*9]  Did the business evolve or change over time?
[19]A. Yes, it did.
[20]Q. How did it evolve or change over time?
[21]A. Well, initially, I was a distributor, but
[22]pretty soon, we were referring a lot of business down to
[23]her, and she was making money off of that, but there
[24]were -- a lot of business wasn't coming up north to us.
[25]So I decided that we had pretty much outgrown that
[12]
[1]relationship, and it was a happenstance thing where one
[2]of my customers knew that there was a -- a -- a -- well,
[3]the -- the -- the chute in California, Power Chute, was
[4]formed by a guy in England, and I knew that, and the guy
[5]that ran it in -- in California was a British guy.
[6]So I knew there was a British connection,
[7]and it so happened that a customer I'd sold a chute to
[8]wanted to buy a quick release, and he was going on
[9]business over to England, and then he made a connection
[10]with the factory, and he bought a quick release. In
[11]fact, he brought several back for me to re-sell and gave
[12]me their name, and that's when I found out that I could
[13]buy the chutes in England. It was really a better made
[14]chute.
[15] [*10]  Q. Okay.
[16]A. So that's how we started -- struck up that
[17]relationship -- started importing those chutes from
[18]England.
[19]Q. You referred to a British guy in the United
[20]States. Who --
[21]A. Uh-huh.
[22]Q. -- was he?
[23]A. Phil Jones.
[24]Q. And the British company?
[25]A. Waterbird. They called it Ascent International
[13]
[1]at that point, but Waterbird was their brand name.
[2]Q. When did your relationship with Waterbird begin
[3]or Sport Chutes' relationship with Waterbird?
[4]A. I want to say in 1984.
[5]Q. So soon after you started --
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. -- Sport Chutes? For how long did the
[8]relationship with Waterbird continue?
[9]A. Until -- we bought the building in 1994 with
[10]the -- we had outgrown our rented facility, and we
[11]wanted to expand the business and -- and in 1994 we
[12]started building our own chutes. At that point, we
[13]didn't need the distributorship with the Waterbird
[14]factory. Plus, we had had some problems with the
[15]quality of their manufacturing and -- and some issues
[16]which were unresolved and some dissatisfaction in
[17]working with them. [*11] 
[18]So it was -- again, we'd outgrown that
[19]relationship as well. It just got to be clumsy trying
[20]to bring the chutes in, and then we had some problems
[21]which we couldn't overcome so it's better just to do it
[22]ourselves.
[23]Q. Okay. And that was in 1994?
[24]A. When we bought the building, that's correct.
[25]Q. So between 1984 and 1994, Sport Chutes didn't
[14]
[1]manufacture any of its product line?
[2]A. No, we mainly did repairs and customizing of
[3]the chutes. We had a sewing gal that would do repairs
[4]for us, and also if somebody wanted a logo on it, then
[5]I'd drop the logo and pin it down, and then she'd sew it
[6]because I'm not -- at that time -- was not a good sewer
[7]and probably not that good still.
[8]Q. Okay. So -- so --
[9]A. I don't do that.
[10]Q. -- so -- so the rec -- so the record's clear
[11]because I think we might have had a double negative
[12]there --
[13]A. Okay.
[14]Q. -- between 1990 -- excuse me -- between 1984
[15]and 1994 --
[16]A. Uh-huh.
[17]Q. -- did Sport Chutes do any of its own
[18]manufacturing?
[19]A. No, just repairs and -- and customizing which
[20] [*12]  I'll call it.
[21]Q. Starting in 1994, did Sport Chutes do any of
[22]its own manufacturing?
[23]A. We transitioned into that. We had -- had made
[24]a -- a friendship with Chris Abbott over in England who
[25]was associated with the family. He was a -- a diesel
[15]
[1]mechanic and had a separate business, and he was
[2]manufacturing a -- a boat for about a year or so with
[3]the owner of Waterbird named Brian Gaskin, and that
[4]company went belly up.
[5]We did buy a couple of boats and import
[6]them, but he was pretty much out of a job so he started
[7]begging us for a job to come over. Plus, he had some
[8]personal issues in -- in his life. He was -- found a
[9]girlfriend and left his wife so he was wanting to get
[10]out of England. So he started really pestering myself
[11]and my ex-husband for a job because he wanted to come
[12]over here and help us.
[13]He had particular expertise on building the
[14]chutes, and we wanted to sell a winch boat which now had
[15]transitioned to Paracraft. Surfrider bought Paracraft
[16]so we wanted to sell the boats as well, and he knew all
[17]the hydraulics so we found that there was a need for
[18]that [*13]  sort of expertise.
[19]Q. Okay. And what I want to try to do is go
[20]through the years and see how your product line
[21]developed. But just, again, so we're clear. Between
[22]1984 and 1994 Sport Chutes just distributed product
[23]rather than manufacture, correct?
[24]A. Exactly.
[25]Q. That's --
[16]
[1]MS. CHANG: I do -- I think you've made
[2]that perfectly clear three times.
[3]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And then starting in 1994,
[4]Sport Chutes began producing its own parasails, correct?
[5]A. Correct.
[6]Q. Starting in 1994, did Sport Chutes design or
[7]manufacture any other parasailing equipment?
[8]A. Yeah. When -- when Chris came on-board, Chris
[9]came on in August of '95. So after -- we didn't
[10]actually take possession of our building in early '94.
[11]I believe it was in the fall. So a few months after
[12]that when Chris came on-board, he helped us set up and
[13]refine our manufacturing and really told us how to build
[14]the chutes efficiently, and then we were building the --
[15]the boats. We bought a -- a boat company out of England
[16]called Paracraft. We wanted to build the boats, and we
[17]found a subcontractor [*14]  to do that, and Chris was to
[18]install the hydraulics and find a local supplier of the
[19]hydraulics and associated with that was the doubles bar
[20]that he designed for us.
[21]Up to that point, Waterbird had the doubles
[22]bars that, according to his testimony, he had designed
[23]for them so …
[24]Q. Chris Abbott designed a doubles bar for?
[25]A. Waterbird. And then, subsequently, imported
[17]
[1]that design and gave it to us and found the local U.S.
[2]suppliers for the clips. He sourced out the metal guy
[3]that would actually cut the aluminum bar out, do the
[4]beveling, and all that and told the guy what we needed
[5]and the length -- all the specs of the bar.
[6]Q. Did Sport Chutes ever distribute a Waterbird
[7]doubles bar?
[8]A. We might have bought one or two of them early
[9]on in the early '90s. I can't recall.
[10]Q. When did doubles bars begin being used in the
[11]business?
[12]A. Well, originally, the -- the commercial
[13]parasailing was off the beach, like I said. Then it
[14]moved to a stationary platform offshore. Then it
[15]transitioned to a motorized platform, and then all that
[16]was a very clumsy [*15]  system.
[17]In the late '80s, the winch boat came about
[18]where it combined all of that where fliers would be
[19]hydraulically launched and retrieved off the back of the
[20]deck of a boat, but it required a -- a specially built
[21]boat with hydraulics and a platform to be able to
[22]inflate the chute. So in the late '80s, this particular
[23]type of parasailing -- we call winch parasailing today
[24]-- was -- was created.
[25]And then it evolved, and there was a couple
[18]
[1]of factories in the U.S. that were building the boats at
[2]that time, and then the one in England which was
[3]building the -- the Paracraft that we wanted to
[4]distribute initially, we sold a few of them, and then we
[5]bought the -- bought the molds and brought them over,
[6]and then we started building them ourselves.
[7]Q. Was there a company that introduced doubles
[8]bars to the industry?
[9]A. I really couldn't tell you that. I know that
[10]Waterbird was always assumed to be the pioneer of the
[11]industry. They would come up with ideas. Brian was an
[12]inventor. A tinkerer.
[13]Q. Brian Gaskin?
[14]A. He's the owner. He was the owner of Waterbird. [*16] 
[15]His son, Vince, later on, the second generation, was the
[16]managing director, if you will. And Chris was part of
[17]the family. He was married to Loraine Gaskin, Brian's
[18]daughter, was around parasailing. He didn't really work
[19]in there.
[20]MS. CHANG: I think the question was just
[21]on the Waterbird -- on -- on the doubles bar and --
[22]THE WITNESS: Yeah.
[23]MS. CHANG: -- who introduced it, and I
[24]think we're going far afield from the answers.
[25]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[19]
[1]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Was there a company that
[2]introduced the doubles bar to the industry that you're
[3]aware of?
[4]A. As -- as far as I know, Waterbird was the only
[5]one I recall.
[6]Q. I believe you testified that Chris Abbott
[7]started at Sport Chutes around 1995; is that correct?
[8]A. August of '95, yes.
[9]Q. When did Sport Chutes first introduce a doubles
[10]bar that it manufactured?
[11]A. It would be after he joined us.
[12]Q. Do you have the time frame?
[13]A. Just after August of '95.
[14]Q. You -- you don't know specifically whether it
[15]was sometime that year or years later?
[16]A. [*17]  No, no, no. He didn't work for us years later.
[17]He only worked for a short time, but it was right away.
[18]That was part of his job was to get us up to snuff and
[19]manufacturing whatever we could.
[20]Q. Prior to Chris joining the company, did you
[21]have the capability to design and manufacture
[22]parasailing equipment at Sport Chutes?
[23]A. Sure. We had all the patterns.
[24]Q. Did you and Curtis have the know how to
[25]actually design and manufacture parasailing equipment?
[20]
[1]A. Sure. We -- we did the repairs and knew how
[2]they went together. I probably more than Curtis because
[3]I actually did a lot of the repairs and some of the
[4]sewing early on to learn how everything worked.
[5]Q. Did you bring Chris on into the company in
[6]order to add the capability to design and manufacture
[7]parasailing equipment?
[8]A. Well, Chris had been around the -- the family,
[9]like I said, and I think he mainly drove the boat for --
[10]for Brian and -- and Vince Gaskin when they did
[11]displays. They used to put on displays like in Dubai
[12]or --
[13]MS. CHANG: I -- I think the question was
[14]did you bring Chris Abbott [*18]  along to help with the
[15]design.
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) How long did Chris Abbott
[18]work for Sport Chutes?
[19]A. He was employed from August of '95 until he
[20]quit in February of '98.
[21]Q. When did Curtis Clark depart the company?
[22]A. When we were divorced in May of '97.
[23]Q. Did you buy Curtis out of the business as part
[24]of the divorce?
[25]A. Yes.
[21]
[1]Q. At that point, you became the sole owner of the
[2]company?
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. Do you remain the sole owner of the company?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. You mentioned parasails. You mentioned doubles
[7]bars. Does Sport Chutes manufacture any other
[8]parasailing equipment?
[9]MS. CHANG: Today?
[10]MR. BIRENBACH: Today.
[11]A. Just the launcher which is a -- a apparatus to
[12]launch a chute for the leisure public.
[13]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) What about harnesses?
[14]A. Yes. Well, that's parasail equipment.
[15]Q. Just to make the record clear because there's
[16]different components in the whole parasailing set-up,
[17]correct?
[18]A. Correct.
[19]Q. You've got the passenger harnesses, right? [*19] 
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. If they are doing tandem parasailing, there
[22]might be a doubles bar, correct?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. Then there's also the parasail itself --
[25]A. Correct.
[22]
[1]Q. -- is that right? And then there's a tow line
[2]that connects to the parasail.
[3]A. Correct.
[4]Q. It -- just for my edification, the launcher
[5]does what? The launcher you refer to, what does that
[6]do?
[7]A. Well, the launcher is a piece of leisure gear
[8]which you put on the beach to assist in launching the
[9]canopy without two people holding up the chute. It's
[10]only a -- a leisure application that has no commercial
[11]application whatsoever.
[12]Q. Okay. We talked about when you started
[13]manufacturing the parasails and the doubles bars. When
[14]did you -- when does Sport Chutes start manufacturing
[15]its own harness?
[16]A. At the same time, '94, '95, but primarily after
[17]Chris came on in '95.
[18]Q. Did Chris as -- assist in designing a harness
[19]for Sport Chutes to manufacture?
[20]A. Yes.
[21]Q. Have you ever worked as a parasail operator?
[22]A. Me, personally?
[23]Q. Yes. [*20] 
[24]A. No. And may I ask for clarification?
[25]Q. Absolutely.
[23]
[1]A. You're talking about commercial operator?
[2]Q. Right. As a --
[3]A. Commercially selling rides?
[4]Q. As opposed to recreational.
[5]A. Right. No, I have not been a commercial
[6]parasail operator.
[7]Q. Have you parasailed on your own using your own
[8]equipment and boat?
[9]A. Yes, thousands of times.
[10]Q. Where do you do that?
[11]A. Well, primarily, Lake Lewisville, but in
[12]training of the leisure users, everywhere.
[13]Q. Is that something you offer as a service or is
[14]that part of your own recreation?
[15]A. Both.
[16]Q. Does Sport Chutes offer training to the leisure
[17]user for a fee?
[18]A. What type of user? Are you saying leisure --
[19]Q. The lei --
[20]A. -- or commercial?
[21]Q. -- leisure.
[22]A. No, for a fee we do not charge. No, we don't
[23]do that.
[24]Q. What about for a commercial operation?
[25]A. No, we don't do that.
[24]
[1]Q. Who at Sport Chutes does the training for the
[2]leisure user?
[3]A. Which time are you referring to?
[4]Q. [*21]  Leisure -- leisure users.
[5]A. I mean, today, then or what -- what --
[6]Q. To -- today.
[7]A. -- would be the date?
[8]Q. Today and then --
[9]A. Today?
[10]Q. -- we'll go back.
[11]A. We really don't do that anymore because the
[12]expertise of the public is now so great that -- and
[13]there -- there's so many people out there that -- that
[14]already have parasails and they know what they're doing.
[15]It's a educated public now. It was different back in
[16]the '80s.
[17]Q. Over what period of time did you offer training
[18]as part of the business of Sport Chutes?
[19]A. Well, when we first started, obviously, in --
[20]in '83 all the way up to -- well, currently, we would
[21]work with a -- a customer in-shop and go on the boat. I
[22]would say it -- it'd be hard to pin down. I would say
[23]not too long ago. A few years ago --
[24]Q. Who --
[25]A. -- because it's not requested.
[25]
[1]Q. -- who are the people over the years that
[2]provided that training as part of the business of Sport
[3]Chutes?
[4]A. Initially, Curtis and I provided that -- that
[5]training. He typically drove the boat, [*22]  and I educated
[6]the ground crew, and then sometimes I was on the boat,
[7]and sometimes he was on the ground crew, but we both did
[8]it in tandem. And then when we started selling the --
[9]the boats commercially, Chris and Curtis and I all did
[10]the training, but Chris was involved in that.
[11]Q. You mentioned it a little bit already, but I
[12]want to drill down a little more on the repair side of
[13]the business.
[14]A. Uh-huh.
[15]Q. Tell me about -- about what sort of repairs
[16]does Sport Chutes provide to its customers.
[17]A. Today? Could you nail down the time frame for
[18]me? When are you speaking about?
[19]Q. Sure. And I apologize for not doing that.
[20]Today.
[21]A. Today? Of -- today, we do any kind of repairs
[22]that are necessary to the chute. If a customer damages
[23]a panel, we replace a panel or patch it.
[24]Q. Do you provide instructions to customers about
[25]the necessity for having professional repairs?
[26]
[1]A. Absolutely.
[2]Q. How do you communicate that to customers?
[3]A. Over the phone and -- and also in the manual.
[4]Q. Sport Chutes has a manual that it provides
[5] [*23]  to --
[6]A. Instructions --
[7]Q. -- its customers?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. When did it first start supplying a manual?
[10]A. Day one.
[11]Q. Did you always tell customers in the manual
[12]that per -- repairs should be done by your company?
[13]A. Yes, plus annual inspections.
[14]Q. By your company?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. Why did you instruct customers to have repairs
[17]done by Sport Chutes?
[18]A. To be sure they were properly repaired.
[19]Q. Why is that a concern of Sport Chutes?
[20]A. Well, people don't have the expertise of the
[21]materials.
[22]Q. What could happen if a chute is not properly
[23]repaired?
[24]A. Well, there's a lot that could happen. You
[25]could induce a rotation which could cause an accident or
27
[1]have something, perhaps, come apart. I -- I -- be
[2]conjuncture on my part, but I wouldn't want to -- it's
[3]common sense to send it back to the factory and let them
[4]rebuild it if -- you know, if it's been damaged.
[5]Q. Why did you instruct customers to have their
[6]parasails undergo an annual inspection?
[7]A. We suggest that just because if they're [*24]  put up
[8]over the winter sometimes mice could eat them. Just to
[9]make sure that they're in operative condition. It's
[10]just good common sense to do that.
[11]Q. What percentage of your customer base ha -- has
[12]you perform the annual inspections?
[13]A. You talking about leisure or commercial now
[14]because --
[15]Q. Commercial.
[16]A. -- it's two different answers.
[17]Q. Commercial.
[18]A. Oh, the commercial guys, a lot of them do send
[19]them in for some kind of annual inspection, and a lot of
[20]them have repairs that need to be fixed, little holes or
[21]little tears or some kind of minor repair. So they
[22]generally send them in and get them checked out.
[23]Q. Is there a protocol or procedure for that
[24]annual inspection?
[25]A. For who?
28
[1]Q. For Sport -- for Sport Chutes. Tell me -- tell
[2]me what the annual inspection consists of that Sport
[3]Chutes performs on customers' parasails.
[4]A. Commercial parasails?
[5]Q. Commercial.
[6]A. Well, we -- we go over the whole chute. We
[7]look at everything. We have a -- a couple of my sewing
[8]gals, who actually build the chutes, they [*25]  know what to
[9]look for, and they literally inspect every square inch
[10]to make sure the stitching has not come up. There's no
[11]tears in the panel. We do stress tests of the material
[12]to be sure material is not rotten. We examine the
[13]lines. We look at the yoke. We make sure that nothing
[14]is stretched or been damaged, and if so, we make a
[15]recommendation to the customer as far as repairs or
[16]replacement of certain items, if anything's worn.
[17]Q. Does Sport Chutes charge for the inspection?
[18]A. Sometimes we do.
[19]Q. Over what period of time has Sport Chutes been
[20]offering the inspections for commercial parasails?
[21]A. Virtually from day one.
[22]Q. How did you prepare for your testimony today?
[23]MS. CHANG: Just -- objection to form.
[24]A. I'm not sure I understand your question.
[25]MS. CHANG: Yeah, a little vague.
29
[1]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Did -- did you review
[2]anything to prepare?
[3]A. Okay. Yes.
[4]Q. What did you review?
[5]A. The depositions.
[6]Q. Whose deposition?
[7]A. Everything that was given to me which was Chris
[8]Abbott's deposition, Mark Bahr's [*26]  deposition, Benjamin
[9]Davis's deposition, the detective -- some information
[10]that he had.
[11]MS. CHANG: Meronard.
[12]A. Meronard, yes. Mark McCulloh's deposition. I
[13]may have left something out, but whatever my counsel
[14]provided me.

[18]A. Of the -- yeah, fact ones.
[19]MS. CHANG: Prior.
[20]A. Yeah.
[21]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) When did you receive the
[22]transcripts of those depositions?
[23]A. At various periods. Whenever --
[24]Q. And so --
[25]A. -- they were done I suppose.
30
[1]Q. -- so they weren't all at once?
[2]A. No.
[3]Q. When did you review them?
[4]A. When they were presented to me.
[5]Q. Did you review anything else to prepare for
[6]your testimony today?
[7]A. Well, I'm not sure how to answer that question.
[8]Q. Well, did you review any documents,
[9]photographs?
[10]MS. CHANG: Reports -- the McCulloh
[11]reports, McSwain.
[12]A. Yes.
[13]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) It's not a trick question.
[14]Just --
[15]A. Well, I -- I --
[16] [*27]  Q. -- anything -- any papers that you may have
[17]reviewed?
[18]MS. CHANG: The photographs of McSwain.
[19]Exhibits that he had.
[20]A. Right.
[21]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Is that the case?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. Anything else?
[24]A. And the photographs the -- the detective had.
[25]The -- Mark McCulloh had some photographs of some
[31]
[1]inspection -- the -- what inspections he did.
[2]Q. Did you meet with anyone in preparation for
[3]your deposition today?

[5]Q. And that's Ms. Chang?
[6]A. Ms. Chang.
[7]MR. BIRENBACH: And off -- off the record.
[8](Break taken for less than one minute.)
[9]MR. BIRENBACH: Back on.
[10]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Well, when did you meet
[11]with Debbie?
[12]MR. BEFERA: Keep your voices up, Counsel.
[13]I'm hearing the witness okay, but some of the
[14]conversations between counsel I'm not picking up. Thank
[15]you.
[16]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[17]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[18]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) When did you meet with
[19]Debbie, Ms. Clark?
[20]A. Yesterday.
[21]Q. Where did you meet?
[22]A. At a hotel in downtown Dallas. [*28] 
[23]Q. For how long did you meet?
[24]A. From 10:00 till about -- I believe it was about
[25]6:00, 6:30.
[32]
[1]Q. Did you talk to anyone else in preparation for
[2]your deposition today?
[3]A. Talked to anybody today about the deposition?
[4]Q. No. No, in preparation for your deposition.
[5]A. I've spoken with Mark McCulloh.
[6]Q. When did you last speak to Mark McCulloh?
[7]A. Today.
[8]Q. Why did you speak to Mark McCulloh today?
[9]A. Well, he just called me this morning.
[10]Q. Did he know you had a deposition today?
[11]A. He had forgotten it was this week. Yeah.
[12]Q. How did he know that it -- it -- it was today?
[13]A. I told him. I reminded him.
[14]Q. Why?
[15]A. Oh, we're just talking. We're friends, too.
[16]Q. Did you talk to anyone else in preparation for
[17]your deposition today?
[18]A. No.
[19]Q. I understand from Mr. McCulloh's deposition
[20]that you had previously met Debbie; is that correct?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. When did you first meet her?
[23]A. I believe it was about last fall.
[24]THE WITNESS: Wasn't it, Debbie?
[25]A. September [*29]  or something.
33
[1]MS. CHANG: I can't answer.
[2]A. I can't remember.
[3]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Okay. And -- and I should
[4]have told you this at the beginning. Everything is to
[5]your best recollection. If you don't remember
[6]something, tell me so, and I'll move on. Okay. I
[7]understand --
[8]A. Okay.
[9]Q. -- that this is kind of going on for a
[10]number --
[11]A. Right.
[12]Q. -- of years so just let me know. You can't ask
[13]counsel.
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. She's not going to tell you.
[16]A. Okay.
[17]MS. CHANG: I probably wouldn't remember
[18]anyway but …
[19]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Right. Who -- who -- who
[20]does remember past five minutes ago? At some point in
[21]time, were you formally retained to assist the
[22]plaintiffs in this lawsuit?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. When was that?
[25]A. Now, you're getting me again on this one. I
[34]
[1]would say it's been maybe 2012 or 2013.
[2]Q. I saw some records indicating, perhaps, maybe
[3]February of 2012. Does that comport with your
[4]recollection?
[5]A. It very well might. I'd have to check it out.
[6]I can't recall [*30]  offhand. It's been a while.
[7]Q. How did you become involved in this case?
[8]A. Well, I was aware of the case, in general,
[9]because when the accident occurred Sarah told me. So I
[10]was aware of that, and I called Mark McCulloh to see if
[11]he was aware of it. That's how I first became aware of
[12]the accident, and then I presume Mark was appo --
[13]approached and to be an expert witness and one thing led
[14]to another.
[15]Q. As part of your formal retention, have you been
[16]paid for your time in working on the case?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. How much have you been paid to date?
[19]A. I believe 2,000 or 2500.
[20]Q. How would you describe your role in working on
[21]this case?
[22]A. Can you give me a little more specific
[23]information --
[24]Q. Are you a --
[25]A. -- so I can answer?
35
[1]Q. -- are you a expert witness? A consulting
[2]witness?
[3]A. As -- as far as I know -- I -- I don't know the
[4]exact legal terms -- but I'm an expert witness as far as
[5]I'm concerned.
[6]Q. Have you prepared any written reports?
[7]A. I have a little slide show here.
[8]MS. CHANG: I think [*31]  she assisted Mark
[9]McCulloh and I think, as he indicated, in his report,
[10]they worked on it together.
[11]MR. BEFERA: I can't hear who's talking,
[12]please.
[13]MS. CHANG: I'm sorry. This is Deborah
[14]Chang. I'll keep my voice up. I indicated that she
[15]assisted Mark McCulloh as he indicated in his testimony
[16]with his report.
[17](Exhibit No. 1 was marked.)
[18]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Ms. Clark, I'm going to
[19]hand back to you what's now been marked as Exhibit 1
[20]which I think is a group of documents you pointed to a
[21]moment ago; is that correct?
[22]A. Yes, sir.
[23]Q. Tell -- tell me what Exhibit 1 is.
[24]A. Exhibit 1 has some general background
[25]information. Would you like me to read it then?
36
[1]Q. No, just generally --
[2]MS. CHANG: As a --
[3]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) -- tell me what it is.
[4]MS. CHANG: -- as a total package what it
[5]is.
[6]A. It's a synopsis of the information regarding
[7]the accident as I see it.
[8]MR. BEFERA: Is there any way, Folks, you
[9]could take a break and scan and e-mail that to me?
[10]MS. CHANG: What's your e-mail and I'll
[11]e-mail [*32]  it to you right now?
[12]MR. BEFERA: It's Steven with a V dot
[13]Befera, B as in boy --
[14]MS. CHANG: Hold on. Hold on. I --
[15]MR. BEFERA: -- e, F as in Frank, e-r-a.
[16]MS. CHANG: Okay. Steven, can you take a
[17]pause for a second? I wasn't ready for you. Now, I'm
[18]ready for you.
[19]MR. BEFERA: Steven, my first name. It's
[20]spelled with a V --
[21]MS. CHANG: Uh-huh.
[22]MR. BEFERA: -- dot Befera, spelled B, as
[23]in boy, e, F, as in Frank, e-r-a --
[24]MR. BIRENBACH: We've got it written out,
[25]Steven.
37
[1]MS. CHANG: Steven B -- it's Steven dot
[2]Befera at --
[3]MR. BEFERA: -- csklegal.com. That's
[4]Charlie, Sierra, Kilo. The word legal -- l-e-g-a-l --
[5]dot com.
[6]MS. CHANG: Okay. I'll call it slides
[7]Exhibit 1. Okay?
[8]MR. BEFERA: Yeah, whatever you're going to
[9]be marking there, just shoot it off to me so I can
[10]follow along.
[11]MS. CHANG: You got it.
[12]MR. BEFERA: Thank you very much.
[13]MS. CHANG: It's coming to you right now.
[14]MR. BEFERA: All right. That's B-e-f,
[15]right?
[16]MS. CHANG: Just give me one second. I
[17]can't answer that [*33]  while I'm doing -- I -- I'm a -- I'm a
[18]uni task girl. Hold on one second. What was your
[19]question? I'm sorry.
[20]MR. BEFERA: I just want to make sure you
[21]got my name spelled right.
[22]MS. CHANG: Here's how I spelled it.
[23]Steven with a V, dot, b-e-f-e-r-a at csklegal.com.
[24]MR. BEFERA: You got it. Thanks.
[25]MS. CHANG: Okay. I just sent it to you.
38
[1]Tell me if you get it.
[2]MR. BEFERA: Thank you. Why don't you go
[3]ahead. I'll -- if I don't get it, I'll let you know. I
[4]don't want to waste time.
[5]MS. CHANG: And -- and if you get it, on
[6]the same token, will you let us know?
[7]MR. BEFERA: I will.
[8]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[9]MR. BEFERA: Thank you.
[10]MS. CHANG: Where are you, Steven? Are you
[11]in Miami? It's -- I think it's in Georgia right now.
[12]MR. BEFERA: I'm in Miami.
[13]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[14]MR. BEFERA: I'm not getting it for
[15]whatever reason.
[16]MS. CHANG: I think it's still on it's way
[17]to you.
[18]MR. BIRENBACH: And I'm going to come back
[19]to it later, Steven, other than maybe --
[20]MS. CHANG: Oh, I -- I show it was sent to
[21]you, and [*34]  it was delivered.
[22]MR. BEFERA: Got it. I just got it. Go
[23]ahead.
[24]MS. CHANG: Okay. Yeah, he got it.
[25]MR. BEFERA: Go ahead. Thank you.
39
[1]MS. CHANG: Isn't technology a -- a
[2]unbelievable thing?
[3]MR. BEFERA: A blessing and a curse.
[4]MR. BIRENBACH: Exactly. That's
[5]stipulated.
[6]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Ms. Clark, referring back
[7]to Exhibit 1. Is this the only written materials that
[8]you've prepared in connection with your work on the
[9]case?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. When did you prepare it?
[12]A. Oh, have been preparing it and Debbie's staff
[13]actually put it together in this sort of format with my
[14]information.
[15]Q. When did you provide the information that's
[16]incorporated into Exhibit 1?
[17]A. Well, it's been provided all along. I can't --
[18]it's not at one particular time.
[19]Q. Okay. I hate this term, but would you call
[20]Exhibit 1 a living document that's grown over time?
[21]A. I don't know how I -- I'm not sure.
[22]Q. Okay.
[23]A. I'm not sure I would describe it that way
[24]because some of those pieces did exist in the file --
[25]Q. Okay. [*35] 
40
[1]A. -- like the invoices, et cetera.
[2]Q. As part of the packet, there's a invoice dated
[3]April 9, 2004 issued by Custom Chutes. When did you
[4]first come into the possession of that invoice?
[5]A. Oh, I'm not -- I -- I'm not sure how that came
[6]about. That was part of the discovery in one of the
[7]depositions. Could have been from Meronard or it was a
[8]-- or from McSwain.
[9]Q. Are you aware that the case was actually filed
[10]sometime after February of 2012?
[11]A. I -- I don't know.
[12]Q. One more question regarding the invoice. I
[13]take it the invoice is not something that you provided
[14]to the attorneys for Victor Rodriguez?
[15]A. Correct. I -- I wouldn't have any access to
[16]those records.
[17]Q. In Exhibit 1 there's a e-mail dated
[18]January 21st, 2013. Do you see that?
[19]A. Yes, sir.
[20]Q. That's an e-mail between you and who?
[21]A. This would have been my rep at Suncor
[22]Stainless, who is Loretta -- I can't read her last name
[23]-- Loretta Rose Smolic, S-m-o-l-i-c. She's a customer
[24]service manager at Suncor Stainless.
[25]Q. And she reps what?
[41]
[1]A. [*36]  Suncor Stainless is a company that distributes
[2]and manufactures stainless hardware of all sorts. A lot
[3]of marine hardware.
[4]Q. Is Suncor Stainless one of Sport Chutes
[5]vendors?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. What does Sport Chutes purchase from Suncor
[8]Stainless?
[9]A. We purchase the clips, the -- the carabineers
[10]for our doubles bars, and we purchase the snap hooks for
[11]our body harnesses, and we have purchased, in the past,
[12]D-rings for our parachutes, and any time we need just,
[13]in general, any kind of metal stainless that we need.
[14]Primarily, those three items.
[15]Q. You use the term clip, and just so the record's
[16]clear when we're using the same terminology, is the clip
[17]the component that is a twisted shackle welded to a
[18]carabineer or a snap hook?
[19]A. No.
[20]Q. What is the clip?
[21]A. A clip on a body harness would be a different
[22]item. It's actually the clip that clips into the
[23]parachute. With particular attention paid to the
[24]doubles bar, the clip assembly would be the carabineer,
[25]which is welded to the twisted shackle, which is then
[42]
[1]applied or -- or a -- or it's [*37]  actually part of the
[2]doubles bar. It's actually -- I can't think of the word
[3]I want to use right now -- but it's adhered to the
[4]doubles bar.
[5]Q. Okay. So when you refer to a clip, you're
[6]referring to something different than a clip assembly,
[7]correct?
[8]A. It could be, but for the purposes of the double
[9]bar, it's the clip assembly. It's the whole unit
[10]because it has component pieces.
[11]Q. And the clip assembly, it -- does that just
[12]consist of a shackle welded to a carabineer?
[13]A. No, it consists of the carabineer welded to a
[14]twisted shackle which is secured to the doubles bar with
[15]a -- a pin.
[16]Q. Got it. Did Sport Chutes purchase clip
[17]assemblies for doubles bars from Suncor Stainless?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. And did -- by the way, does Sport Chutes sell
[20]triples bars?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. So you can either get a doubles bar or a
[23]triples bar?
[24]A. Exactly. Just longer with more straps.
[25]Q. The triples bars, do they also use the same
43
[1]type of clip assembly that's on a doubles bar?
[2]A. Correct.
[3]Q. Where did -- well, strike that. For how [*38]  long
[4]has Suncor Stainless been your supplier for clip
[5]assemblies for doubles and triples bars?
[6]A. When Chris Abbott sourced them out so that
[7]would be since 1995.
[8]Q. And where does Suncor Stainless source its clip
[9]assemblies from for the doubles and triples bars?
[10]A. They don't provide the whole assembly. I only
[11]purchase the carabineer from them, and it's my
[12]understanding that it's manufactured in Italy because it
[13]says Italy on it, and that's what she confirmed in my
[14]conversation with her.
[15]Q. Who does the welding of the carabineer to the
[16]shackle for the clip assemblies that Sport Chutes
[17]utilizes in its manufacturing?
[18]A. I get them welded by a company that does
[19]stainless welding.
[20]Q. Is that in Texas or --
[21]A. Yeah, they're here in Dallas.
[22]Q. So I take it that you purchased a shackle --
[23]you purchase the carabineer, and you weld them together
[24]to create the clip assembly that's then becomes a
[25]component for doubles or triples bar?
44
[1]A. That's correct.
[2]Q. At some point in time in your work on the --
[3]the Victor Rodriguez case, did you [*39]  se -- see photographs
[4]of clip assemblies on a doubles bar?
[5]A. Yes, I did.
[6]Q. Both of those clip assemblies had shackles
[7]welded to carabineers, correct?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. And there were some numbers on those
[10]carabineers; is that right?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. When did you first see those numbers?
[13]A. Well, I've known those numbers were there since
[14]day one. Since 1995.
[15]Q. The -- the carabineers that you saw on the
[16]photographs -- well, let -- let's -- let's strike that.
[17]Have you ever been to the Bahamas to see any equipment
[18]that may have been used at the time of the accident?
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. When did you do that?
[21]A. Well, my ex-husband and I and Brian Gaskin flew
[22]there way back I believe it was in the late '80s, and I
[23]actually met Sarah Lihou's father and actually, I flew
[24]on their platform and saw their equipment because we
[25]wanted to sell them gear at that point.
[45]
[1]Q. Okay. I didn't ask a very good question.
[2]A. Okay.
[3]Q. But --
[4]A. I'm sorry.
[5]Q. No, my --
[6]MS. CHANG: Well, you said in this case.
[7] [*40]  Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Yeah, I meant -- I wanted
[8]to know ha -- have you ever gone to the Bahamas to look
[9]at any equipment in connection with this accident that
[10]we're talking about where you're working on this case?
[11]A. No.
[12]Q. So you've only seen photographs of equipment
[13]that was represented to you that had been recovered
[14]after the accident, correct?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. But you saw photographs of the clip assemblies
[17]on a bar, correct?
[18]A. On the bar involved in the accident that the
[19]detective -- was presented to the detective.
[20]Q. And the photographs had -- strike that. The
[21]carabineers on the clip assemblies that you saw in the
[22]photographs, are they the same carabineers or same model
[23]carabineers that you use at Sport Chutes for your
[24]passenger bars?
[25]A. Yes.
46
[1]Q. And, by the way, Chris Abbott always tells me
[2]it's a passenger bar. It's not a tow bar. Do you agree
[3]with that?
[4]A. Well, I think it's just semantics.
[5]Q. Okay. But you'll use the -- so you use the
[6]word tow bar interchangeably with passenger bar?
[7]A. Right, because it's towing [*41]  passengers so D-bar,
[8]tow bar, doubles bar.
[9]MS. CHANG: What does he call it?
[10]MR. BIRENBACH: Passenger bar.
[11]MS. CHANG: I never heard that.
[12]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And -- and your attorney
[13]or-- or Mr. Rodriguez's attorney's going to object, but
[14]I'm going to ask this because I forgot. My memory's
[15]even shorter than yours. The carabineers that you saw
[16]in the pictures they're the same as the carabineers that
[17]you use on your passenger bars?
[18]A. I believe they're from the same factory.
[19]Q. For how long have the carabineers that you use
[20]been sourced from that factory?
[21]A. Well, I couldn't answer that because I buy from
[22]Suncor Stainless, and I -- as far as I know, from my
[23]recollection, they look like that's the same one that
[24]they've always sold me.
[25]MS. CHANG: Can I have his question read
47
[1]back?
[2](The question was read back.)
[3]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And maybe the question
[4]wasn't clear now that I've heard it back. The -- the
[5]carabineers that you saw in the pictures of the
[6]equipment at issue in this case had a stamp that they
[7]were made in Italy; [*42]  is that right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. And the carabineers that you use in your
[10]business are also made in Italy; is that right?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. And this -- you -- you don't know whether
[13]you've been receiving a -- carabineers from the same
[14]factory in Italy or not, right?
[15]A. Because I buy it from a distributor because
[16]from what I recall that's been the -- the only
[17]carabineer I've ever seen on any doubles bar from
[18]anywhere.
[19]Q. Now, why did you contact Suncor Stainless in
[20]January of 2013?
[21]A. Because I wanted to -- an explanation of the
[22]codes as I saw stamped on the carabineer.
[23]Q. Why did you want that?
[24]A. I suspected it was a date code.
[25]Q. What did you learn after you contacted --
48
[1]A. It --
[2]Q. -- Suncor?
[3]A. -- it was, in fact, a date code.
[4]Q. Aside from the e-mail that's part of Exhibit 1,
[5]were there any other communications with Suncor about
[6]that?
[7]A. No.
[8]Q. Did you talk to anyone on the phone at Suncor
[9]about the date code?
[10]A. I -- I just -- I called them originally and
[11]asked them is -- if [*43]  they could find out what that code
[12]meant, and then she sent me the e-mail in response.
[13]Q. And the representative at Suncor confirmed that
[14]the numbers included a date code, correct?
[15]A. That's correct.
[16]Q. Now, you had a opportunity I believe to look at
[17]the report of Dr. McSwain?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. And Dr. McSwain indicated in his report that
[20]there were some numbers imprinted on the carabineers
[21]that he inspected in the Bahamas; is that right?
[22]A. That's correct.
[23]Q. Are those the same numbers that you observed in
[24]your inspection of the photographs?
[25]A. Well, there's actually several sets of numbers.
49
[1]He referred to the Italy stamping in the 3 16. 3 16 is
[2]a -- from what I understand -- I'm not a metallurgist --
[3]but it's a quality of stainless. He did address that
[4]point. He was unable to explain this code, though. He
[5]wasn't able to -- to come up with an explanation of what
[6]this particular stamping meant as they have a -- another
[7]-- they have three separate ones.
[8]Q. But as -- you -- you have no reason to dispute
[9]the numbers that he reported in his report? [*44] 
[10]A. Well, he had no -- yeah, he had no comment on
[11]these co -- code because he didn't know.
[12]Q. And all I'm asking is whether -- whether you
[13]saw different numbers than he reported, right?
[14]A. No.
[15]Q. He didn't -- he didn't know what the numbers
[16]meant --
[17]A. Right.
[18]Q. -- correct?
[19]A. Right.
[20]Q. But you ascertained what those numbers meant?
[21]A. Yes, and it's the first -- first -- let me put
[22]my glasses on -- it's the first row of numbers so -- I'm
[23]sorry -- the second row of numbers. The second line.
[24]Q. And that's the numbers that you saw on the
[25]carabineers in the photographs that were provided to you
50
[1]in connection with your work on the case; is that --
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. -- correct?
[4]A. By Meronard and McSwain and McCulloh.
[5]Q. And you knew those numbers were important to
[6]this case, and that's why you reached out to Suncor
[7]Stainless?
[8]A. Yes.
[9]Q. And just in your own personal experience, if
[10]you purchase carabineers from Suncor Stainless in 2013,
[11]will they have a -- numbers consistent with when you
[12]made that [*45]  purchase?
[13]A. Yes. For instance, if I might explain, the top
[14]row of numbers there -- and let -- let me put my glasses
[15]on again to recite this -- 121122-12, that was a clip
[16]which was, according to her explanation, it was -- 12
[17]would be the year of production. The second four
[18]numbers would be the number of technical sheet of
[19]production. Then the last two numbers would be when the
[20]connectors were finished and arrived ready in the
[21]warehouse.
[22]So the reason why she has both sets of
[23]numbers is because I had some clips that I had purchased
[24]from her recently, and I said here's the clip that I
[25]just bought from you and here's a picture of another
[51]
[1]clip, and that she was reporting on both of those
[2]numbers back to me.
[3]Q. So --
[4]A. One was in my possession, and one was from the
[5]accident.
[6]Q. Okay. So you actually provided to her pictures
[7]that had been provided to you of the equipment in the
[8]Bahamas?
[9]A. Yes. Well, I -- I sent that to her so she
[10]could identify because I said there's several different
[11]markings on there, and I wanted to be sure she
[12]understood what [*46]  marking I was referring to that I need
[13]explanation of.
[14]Q. And the equipment in the Bahamas that you were
[15]provided photographs of had two carabineers, correct?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. And they -- each carabineer had the same
[18]numbers?
[19]A. It was imprinted with the same number --
[20]correct -- which was the bottom number, not the top
[21]number.
[22]Q. The 057659-05?
[23]A. Yes, sir.
[24]Q. And, based on your investigation, you concluded
[25]that those carabineers were manufactured in 2005 --
[52]
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. -- is that correct? Just -- we talked over
[3]each other. Is that -- you -- you concluded that the
[4]two carabineers that you saw in the photographs were
[5]manufactured in 2005, correct?
[6]A. That's correct.
[7]MR. BIRENBACH: Off the record.
[8](Break taken at 12:07 p.m. to 12:17 p.m.)
[9]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Ms. Clark, still referring
[10]to Exhibit 1, the last two pages I understand are screen
[11]shots from a video; is that right?
[12]A. Correct.
[13]Q. And your or the attorney for Mr. Rodriguez just
[14]showed us the video on her computer?
[15]A. Yes.
[16] [*47]  Q. Did you supply Mr. Rodriguez's attorneys with
[17]that video?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. When did you supply that video?
[20]A. I want to say about six months ago.
[21]Q. Why did you supply it?
[22]A. To me, that explains a lot of what can happen
[23]in this particular case, and it explains the rotation of
[24]the canopy. It explains when clips are released from
[25]the canopy, what the canopy looks like, and that
53
[1]collaborates what the witnesses saw, and what -- I had a
[2]conversation -- a taped conversation with Sarah Lihou,
[3]and in that conversation she has noticed some of the
[4]things that we see in here.
[5]Q. How did you obtain the video?
[6]A. As a matter of course in my investigation, I
[7]look for all sources of information and do my research,
[8]and I was able to locate that particular video on the
[9]internet.
[10]Q. Do you know where it was taken?
[11]A. I do not.
[12]Q. The video shows someone parasailing; is that
[13]right?
[14]A. Yes, sir, off a platform which is similar to
[15]the -- the platform that was in the Bahamas. That's a
[16]platform operation.
[17]Q. Was a doubles bar being used [*48]  in that video?
[18]A. No, it was not because it's a single person.
[19]Q. Was a triples bar being used in the video?
[20]A. No, it's not.
[21]Q. In reviewing the video, did you ascertain what
[22]happened?
[23]A. Yes, which closely matched the testimony of
[24]Sarah Lihou in our phone conversations, which was the
[25]flier in this particular video became detached from the
54
[1]parasail and fell into the water, which is what she told
[2]me in my recorded conversation that the fliers -- except
[3]they were attached to a doubles bar -- the fliers and
[4]the doubles bars became detached and fell into the
[5]water.
[6]Q. Based on your observation of this video, you
[7]concluded that something became detached in a flight?
[8]A. That's correct. His harness strap on the right
[9]side became detached. In fact, I've had that happen
[10]myself. Well, actually, Curtis was driving the boat,
[11]and we were teaching somebody at the lake, and in my
[12]haste, I forgot to clip in the right side of my harness
[13]strap to the chute. And when Curtis accelerated the
[14]boat, the right riser went up in the air so far to where
[15]I couldn't hold [*49]  it it was so strong, and the whole chute
[16]fell over exactly what happened here except my left
[17]strap was still attached because I was at a very low
[18]altitude.
[19]Had this particular incident occurred at a
[20]high altitude, probably would have been the same result
[21]that what Sarah said she saw. The people fell out with
[22]the double bars into the water as he did. He actually
[23]fell out of the whole assembly and into the water, and
[24]the chute collapsed which is consistent with the
[25]testimony of the people on the shore and also on the
55
[1]platform of what they saw.
[2]Q. The rota -- the rotation of the parasail in the
[3]video that can be induced by a harness strap becoming
[4]detached; is that right?
[5]A. Well, it could be a harness strap. It could be
[6]a -- a -- the -- a -- the clip assembly. It could be
[7]anything attached to that particular D-ring on one side
[8]of the riser. You have the yoke. The yoke is attached
[9]to the tow line which is in a V. It would -- would be a
[10]upsidedown V facing you, and then you have two similar
[11]Vs on the right and the left which would be pointing
[12]upwards much in the shape -- [*50]  it's actually a U -- but at
[13]the bottom of that U would be a clip, and that's where
[14]the harness or the doubles bar would clip in to.
[15]If you're flying one person, you have a --
[16]a left and a right riser strap with a spring loaded clip
[17]which would clip into there. If you're using the
[18]doubles or the triples bar, you have the clip assembly
[19]which would be the carabineer welded to the twisted
[20]shackle and inserted into the doubles bar with a pin,
[21]and that's a captive pin, not a non-captive pin, as what
[22]was surrendered in the photographs from Detective
[23]Meronard. We -- I've always used captive pins, but in
[24]this particular instance, of the doubles bar in the
[25]Bahamas, they had a non-captive pin which is
[56]
[1]non-standard and not recommended for the industry.
[2]Q. But returning to my questions about the
[3]video --
[4]A. Uh-huh.
[5]Q. -- the rotation of the parasail that you see in
[6]the video that can be induced by a harness strap coming
[7]off the yoke of the parasail; is that right?
[8]A. Yes, the harness strap, but that will also be
[9]the same result of the doubles bar clip assembly where
[10] [*51]  become detached from the same side. It would have the
[11]same result. The canopy would rotate over.
[12]Essentially, it's a -- it's in a lock-out situation, and
[13]it's rolling over in an un -- unrecoverable spin.
[14]Q. And that's because the weight is shifted all to
[15]one side?
[16]A. Exactly.
[17]Q. So it's the weight shift that causes the
[18]parasail to rollover?
[19]A. And the shock load of all the weight of the su
[20]-- the suspended -- the pendulum weight underneath the
[21]chute. In that -- in this case of the accident, Victor
[22]Rodriguez reported that he and his wife weighed
[23]approximately 320 pounds, collectively. And so if the
[24]clip became detached from one side, then there would be
[25]a shock load of 320 pounds asserted on the remaining
57
[1]clip which would be attached to the parachute and cause
[2]amore vicious rotation because it's more weight.
[3]Q. Now, just getting back to my line of
[4]questioning before you pointed to Exhibit 1. Do you
[5]anticipate preparing a re -- a formal written report for
[6]your work on this case?
[7]A. I have no idea. If I'm requested, I would.
[8]Q. Have you been requested? [*52] 
[9]A. This is the only thing that I've -- that I've
[10]created so far. But I was also involved in the -- with
[11]Mark McCulloh in the creation of the -- his concerns
[12]about the -- the doubles bar as far as some non-factory
[13]or industry standard specifications about the recovered
[14]doubles bar in the Bahamas.
[15]Q. So you provided information to Mr. McCulloh
[16]that he relied on in preparation of his report; is that
[17]right?
[18]A. Right, and we discussed that because he has a
[19]different area of expertise than -- and -- and some of
[20]these things were out the -- outside the scope of his
[21]expertise when it comes to manufacturing tow bars or
[22]actually building them -- he's -- would rely on my
[23]knowledge in that regard.
[24]Q. What are the things that are outside the scope
[25]of his expertise that he put in his reports that --
58
[1]MS. CHANG: Do you want me to -- why don't
[2]I pull his report out and then she can --
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: Sure.
[4]MS. CHANG: -- turn to that of the portions
[5]that she assisted. I don't like to carry things so I
[6]Fed-Exed it. Oh, you might have it. It's the -- his
[7]report [*53]  that he had.
[8]THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think I might.
[9]MS. CHANG: I have all of these things.
[10]THE WITNESS: Is that it?
[11]MS. CHANG: Do you want to mark that
[12]first --
[13]MR. BIRENBACH: Sure.
[14]MS. CHANG: -- and then she can go through
[15]it.
[16](Exhibit No. 2 was marked.)
[17]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Ms. Clark, I'm going to
[18]hand you what's been marked as Exhibit 2. Is this the
[19]McCulloh report that you were referring to?
[20]A. Yes, sir.
[21]Q. Have you seen his other report that he prepared
[22]in this case?
[23]A. I don't know what you're talking about. This
[24]is the one I've seen besides his deposition.
[25]Q. Well, continuing on with Exhibit 2 --
59
[1]MS. CHANG: Do you want to look at it while
[2]he's looking --
[3]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[4]MS. CHANG: -- for his and maybe you can
[5]mark for us the portions that you assisted with.
[6]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[7]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Well, we'll -- we'll get
[8]back to his other report. Let's con -- just focus in on
[9]Exhibit 2 unless you need a moment to review it.
[10]MS. CHANG: I think she's looking at [*54]  it
[11]right now.
[12]THE WITNESS: Yeah.
[13]A. And do you want me to just make a -- a note
[14]here where we're going down?
[15]MS. CHANG: Yeah. Sure. That's fine.
[16]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Okay. What are you -- just
[17]tell us what you're noting.
[18]A. Okay. Primarily --
[19]Q. Well, you could -- well, let's do it this way.
[20]Review it, make your note, and then I'll go back and ask
[21]you --
[22]A. Oh --
[23]Q. -- what you noted.
[24]A. -- okay. I'm noting all the photographs here.
[25]Okay.
60
[1]Q. And I hate -- I hate doing this, but would you
[2]mind if I come on --
[3]A. Sure.
[4]Q. -- your side? I'll try not to get too close.
[5]A. That's all right. I don't have anything --
[6]Q. As we go through what you noted --
[7]A. As far as I know.
[8]Q. -- Ms. -- Ms. Clark, you've had an opportunity
[9]to review Exhibit 2; is that correct?
[10]A. That's correct. Briefly.
[11]Q. And you made some written notes on Exhibit 2?
[12]A. Yes, I did.
[13]Q. And in blue ink?
[14]A. Yes.
[15]Q. Just tell me what you noted. Well, I see that
[16]the first note is on [*55]  page 2; is that correct?
[17]A. That's correct. The first bullet point.
[18]Q. And why did you make the note there?
[19]A. Well, he's talking about the date of the
[20]non-captive pin. Basically, there's two types of -- of
[21]clip assemblies, if you will, and the bottom portion is
[22]the twisted shackle from Wichard. Wichard is a French
[23]company that manufactures the -- the twist shackle.
[24]The twist shackle come in two versions, one
[25]with captive pin and one with a non-captive pin. And
[61]
[1]when Chris Abbott designed this bar, he emphasized the
[2]importance of having -- always ordering the right one so
[3]they had a captive pin so the pin can't fall out or back
[4]out. A non-captive pin would be a pin which is separate
[5]from the assembly and is removable totally.
[6]So this particular tow bar, which was
[7]presented to the detective in the pictures that I
[8]reviewed, had a -- a non-captive pin in the Wichard
[9]twist shackle at the bottom of the clip assembly, which
[10]would allow the -- the pin to back out, be twisted out,
[11]vibrate out -- there's a lot of things that could happen
[12]to make that pin become loose. And [*56]  we discussed the --
[13]the fact that there are two types of Wichard twist
[14]shackles.
[15]Q. So the information that Mr. McCulloh put in
[16]that bullet on page 2 is information that you provided
[17]to him?
[18]A. As far as captive versus non-captive pins, yes.
[19]Q. So that was an area of expertise that you had
[20]that he didn't?
[21]A. Right, because he's not a manufacturer and --
[22]and may or may not be privy at that level.
[23]Q. Then what's the next marking on what page?
[24]A. Would be all the way down through from that
[25]page up to the top of page 5 before basis of opinions.
62
[1]Q. Okay. So the -- so it's actually a bracket --
[2]A. Exactly --
[3]Q. -- page 2 through --
[4]A. -- all the --
[5]Q. -- page 4?
[6]A. Page 5. Top of 5.
[7]Q. Pardon me. So all that information, on page 2
[8]through page 5, where the bracket ends, is information
[9]you provided to Mr. McCulloh?
[10]A. That -- yes, that we -- that we discussed, as
[11]far as the manufacturing aspects, which were -- were our
[12]standards, if you will, at Sport Chutes when Chris
[13]Abbott joined my employment. Would you [*57]  like me to run
[14]through them?
[15]Q. Well, no, it -- what's written is written but
[16]-- and we might come back to some of it, but I just
[17]wanted to know what information you provided to
[18]Mr. McCulloh, and that's the information between page 2
[19]and 5 and between the brackets, correct?
[20]A. Not totally. Some of this information, he
[21]already knew. For instance, he knew that it was a raw
[22]aluminum bar, and he knew that a raw aluminum bar was
[23]not a good idea to have in salt water. He already was
[24]very much aware of that fact. But what he didn't know
[25]was is a raw aluminum bar an industry standard, which I
63
[1]explained no, a raw aluminum bar is not an industry
[2]standard for a doubles or -- or any kind of a doubles,
[3]triples bar.
[4]So he may have had a basic knowledge of the
[5]-- the bar as he saw it, and he saw things that -- that
[6]he felt were inappropriate for the application, but he
[7]didn't know if that was a -- an industry standard or how
[8]that would extrapolate to a manufacturer.
[9]Q. And those are things that you consider yourself
[10]an expert in; is that right?
[11]A. Right. Just the fact [*58]  of the -- of the
[12]manufacturing of the -- the manufacturing standards and,
[13]again, these were things as explained and taught to me
[14]by -- by Chris Abbott. This is why we do this. For
[15]instance, say a -- a plate on an outdrive is aluminum
[16]because we know that the salt water will attack a raw
[17]aluminum instead of the metal. So he always said that
[18]we need to anodize or powder coat our bars to protect
[19]them from the salt water elements which I always have.
[20]Q. So I -- well, we'll come back to that.
[21]Regarding Mr. McCulloh, you've known him a long time; is
[22]that correct?
[23]A. Curtis and I met him -- and I think we stayed
[24]in his home -- we met in 1985 along with Brian Gaskin
[25]way back then.
64
[1]Q. And he has a certain area of expertise,
[2]correct?
[3]A. Yes, he's -- has -- he runs a parasail -- a
[4]safety committee, and he's been one of the first
[5]operators and inventors of the wench system for
[6]parasailing.
[7]Q. So his expertise is in the wench system and in
[8]operations; is that correct?
[9]A. Well, I wouldn't want to speak for him. I
[10]think he has a lot of general knowledge about [*59]  the
[11]industry as well, but he's -- he has extensive knowledge
[12]because he's operated parasail concessions, and he's a
[13]designer and inventor.
[14]Q. But -- but, in this particular case, you had an
[15]expertise in the area of the manufacture and design of
[16]passenger bars that he didn't have; is that correct?
[17]A. Correct, because he never would have built one.
[18]Q. It's -- some of your knowledge, in the area of
[19]the design and manufacture of passenger bars, came from
[20]Chris Abbott, correct?
[21]A. That's correct.
[22]Q. And Chris Abbott is one of the owners of Custom
[23]Chutes to your understanding, correct?
[24]A. As I -- as part of his deposition said that,
[25]yes.
65
[1]Q. And your ex-husband is also an owner at Custom
[2]Chutes as far as you're aware?
[3]A. I -- I have no idea. I presume so.
[4]Q. Sin -- since you brought it up, this is
[5]probably a good time to talk about the design of the
[6]passenger bar sold by Sport Chutes, and I'm going to do
[7]that by looking at some photographs.
[8]MS. CHANG: Are you looking for McSwain's?
[9]MR. BIRENBACH: Yeah. And I have what's
[10]already [*60]  been marked as De -- McSwain Deposition
[11]Exhibit 5.
[12]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[13]MR. BIRENBACH: Do you see any reason to
[14]remark it or --
[15]MS. CHANG: No.
[16]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[17]MS. CHANG: We all know.
[18]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And this is a printout that
[19]we did of that, and I just want to go through that with
[20]you.
[21]A. Sure.
[22]MR. BEFERA: This is McSwain Exhibit 5?
[23]MR. BIRENBACH: Correct.
[24]MS. CHANG: Correct.
[25]MR. BIRENBACH: It's about a hundred and
66
[1]fifty pages of photographs.
[2]MR. BEFERA: A hundred and fifty-two.
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[4]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And I want to focus on the
[5]first few pages, Ms. Clark. Is that a picture of a -- a
[6]Sport Chutes' passenger bar?
[7]A. Yes, it is.
[8]Q. Did you provide that passenger bar to
[9]Dr. McSwain?
[10]A. I did.
[11]Q. When did you provide it to him?
[12]A. We had a meeting I believe it was in January of
[13]perhaps '14. I -- I don't recall the exact date. Don't
[14]hold me to that because I can't --
[15]Q. Sure.
[16]A. -- I don't remember.
[17]Q. And he testified [*61]  that you actually went to
[18]Pensacola for that meeting?
[19]A. I did.
[20]Q. And you brought him some equipment to look at?
[21]A. I did because he had no idea of this particular
[22]item. It was foreign to him.
[23]Q. And -- and the -- Mr. McSwain is very organized
[24]and all -- all of his photographs are numbered. Do you
[25]see on this first page that I have out in front of you
[67]
[1]that DPE1 through DPE4?
[2]MS. CHANG: Just correction. Dr. McSwain.
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: Dr. McSwain.
[4]MS. CHANG: You just want to see that the
[5]--
[6]THE WITNESS: Can you bring it a little
[7]closer?
[8]MS. CHANG: They're all numbered.
[9]A. Yes, I see that.
[10]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And all four of those are
[11]Sport Chute or a Sport Chutes' passenger bar that you
[12]brought to him?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. Who designed that passenger bar?
[15]A. Chris Abbott originally designed it, and then
[16]over the years, I've made improvements.
[17]Q. I just want to go through all of those
[18]improvements.
[19]A. Uh-huh.
[20]Q. What were the improvements that you made after
[21]Chris's original design? [*62] 
[22]A. Well, we padded the whole bar. We have added
[23]nylon straps instead of polypropylene straps. We added
[24]a redundant feature -- two redundant features to
[25]eliminate the -- the possibility of a strap breaking
68
[1]underneath. We actually wrap another strap over the top
[2]of the unit so, in the unlikely event, should the strap
[3]break where it -- there's a -- a hole in the doubles bar
[4]where the strap is attached and goes through.
[5]Now, my bars have always been beveled
[6]because Chris said it's important to bevel the edges so
[7]there's no sharp edges there. So the strap goes through
[8]the beveled edge underneath which you can't see, but
[9]there's some other later photographs explaining that
[10]because I have a raw bar. And then we added a strap on
[11]top, which is a non-load bearing strap, should that wear
[12]where you can't see it going through the -- the bar
[13]underneath the padding. Then we have a -- a -- a
[14]non-load bearing nylon strap over the top which is going
[15]to hold the assembly to the bar.
[16]The second redundant feature we added was a
[17]-- a -- a piece of cord which is attached to the bar
[18]with a -- [*63]  a strap -- a nylon strap encircling the whole
[19]bar, and that goes through the top of the carabineer.
[20]In the event there's some kind of a failure with a
[21]clip -- a loose clip or the clip comes off the bar, then
[22]that would be a rescue feature so that the bar could not
[23]possibly become detached from the parasail.
[24]We also are using a thicker gauge -- a
[25]D-ring. We -- we've gone to a thicker gauge. Just
69
[1]precautionary stuff that doesn't -- doesn't really cost
[2]a lot of money to do that. It's just another evolution
[3]of that in rethinking -- trying to foresee a -- a
[4]potential or, even as remote as they may be, something
[5]that could be deemed a -- a failure or just trying to
[6]anticipate.
[7]Q. These changes that you just referred to, were
[8]they done at all once or over time?
[9]A. They were done all at once. It's just
[10]improvements.
[11]Q. Well, let me ask it this way.
[12]A. Okay.
[13]Q. When did the Sport Chutes first start padding
[14]the whole bar?
[15]A. From day one. It's always been padded. When
[16]Chris -- Chris had -- you know, he designed it that way
[17]because should the bar -- should [*64]  a tow line break when
[18]the fliers were sitting on the back of a parasail wench
[19]boat, the tow line would have recoil, and you wouldn't
[20]want that bar to come back because the bar's kind of in
[21]line -- when they're flying, it's over their head -- but
[22]when they're sitting on the back of the platform, it's
[23]kind of in line with their head. So you wouldn't want
[24]that bar to slap back at them like a sling shot and
[25]injure them. So the bars from Sport Chutes have always
70
[1]been padded. I've never sold any of them that have
[2]never been padded, and I wouldn't.
[3]Q. That was a design feature that Chris Abbott --
[4]A. Yes, and -- and certainly and it's common
[5]sense. You want them padded just -- even if it's
[6]slightly padded. You can't make it too big and too
[7]clumsy because you can't fit the hardware, but you need
[8]to have some protection there.
[9]Q. And perhaps my question wasn't clear or you
[10]misunderstood it but just for clarification --
[11]A. Uh-huh.
[12]Q. -- purposes. What I had asked you earlier was
[13]were there any changes to Chris's original design of the
[14]bar?
[15]A. Chris's -- may I [*65]  say what his original design
[16]was and then we can --
[17]Q. Sure.
[18]A. -- say what changed? Okay.
[19]Q. That's a good way of doing it.
[20]A. Original design was it was an anodized or
[21]powder coated bar. We started anodizing all of ours
[22]because our metal guy anodized the bars. The holes
[23]where the straps would go through were always beveled.
[24]There was also a bushing -- a brass bushing which was
[25]implanted in the hole where the captive pin from the
[71]
[1]clip assembly would be inserted into the bar.
[2]Those were the primary things that were the
[3]most important things as far as the -- Chris's design of
[4]the bar, and then the color coded straps so that the --
[5]that may be my phone -- that the straps were color coded
[6]so that the weight and balance moment in arm, the weight
[7]distribution would be more level so that the chute would
[8]-- would fly more level -- so the original color coded
[9]straps were his design. The length of the straps, his
[10]recommendation. The padding, the beveled inserts, the
[11]holes where the straps would go through, and then the --
[12]the bushings which would go in place of the holes [*66]  where
[13]the pin would be inserted to attach the clips, and the
[14]clips were sourced out by him.
[15]He -- he found -- these clips were the same
[16]ones that they used in the Waterbird factory, and he
[17]found a U.S. distributor for them which is -- Wichard
[18]has their own office here. They distribute their
[19]twisted shackle with the captive pin, and then the
[20]carabineer he sourced out at Suncor Stainless so …
[21]Q. Did Sport Chutes sell passenger bars with
[22]polypropylene straps rather than nylon straps at any
[23]time?
[24]A. I think originally we did when Chris was there
[25]because that was a material that he was familiar with.
72
[1]After I started doing some investigation in looking at
[2]strength factors and the fact that polypropylene is
[3]going to not last as long in the sun, it's not as
[4]abrasive resistant, I made the -- the change to nylon
[5]straps.
[6]Q. When did that change occur?
[7]A. I -- I can't remember.
[8]Q. Did it occur before or after 2004?
[9]A. Oh, gosh, it would -- it would be much before
[10]that.
[11]Q. Do you know when?
[12]A. No, I couldn't tell you. Chris left me in '98
[13] [*67]  so we're talking about a long time ago. I don't know,
[14]but at some point, nylon webbing is much stronger. It's
[15]much more resistant to the UV, has UV resistance to the
[16]sun's rays so it's -- it's not going to deteriorate.
[17]The contaminates of the environment, it's more resistant
[18]to that. It's just a better product all together.
[19]Q. And the nylon webbing that you used, that's for
[20]the -- the straps that hang down from the passenger bar
[21]and connect to the harnesses; is that --
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. -- right?
[24]A. The other change I made, too, is I added more
[25]layers there. Originally, Chris had designed the
73
[1]passenger bars with -- with one strap -- one layer of
[2]webbing to come down. Then it evolved into two, and I
[3]actually have several so it just -- I have several
[4]thicknesses. This webbing, for instance, is a
[5]7,000-pound test webbing, a two-inch nylon webbing.
[6]So when you sew two or three together, it
[7]doesn't extrapolate to exactly 21,000 pounds because
[8]you've got it sewed good, but it's way up there, and
[9]it's only suspending a pendulum weight of perhaps
[10]several hundred pounds. Again, [*68]  it's just
[11]overengineering this so that there's no foreseeable
[12]failures that we could anticipate.
[13]Q. When did you start using three layers of
[14]webbing for the straps?
[15]A. When I switched to nylon as far as I recall.
[16]This has been some time -- this has been a long time
[17]ago. Talking about 10 years ago or something.
[18]Q. Fair enough. Just need to exhaust your memory.
[19]A. Right. That'd be --
[20]Q. It's the best that you can remember. Having
[21]looked at the photographs of the bar in the Bahamas, did
[22]you see any evidence that any of the straps broke or
[23]failed on that particular bar?
[24]A. No, I just saw extreme wear.
[25]Q. But did you see any evidence that the straps
74
[1]broke or failed?
[2]A. Not on the bar that was surrendered to
[3]Detective Meronard.
[4]Q. Now, you talked about some added redundant
[5]features, and I got a little lost so I'm going to go
[6]back and ask you some questions about that. You refer
[7]to a strap on top. What exactly were you referring to,
[8]and you can write on Exhibit 5.
[9]A. Okay. How about if I circle it on this
[10]particular one here? If [*69]  you look at the difference
[11]between Detective Meronard's surrendered bar, his straps
[12]-- of -- of course, there's no padding on it so it's a
[13]lot easier to see -- but his straps go through a hole
[14]and come back down, and there is no piece which covers
[15]the top of the bar and then comes back down, sandwiches
[16]-- it's a non-load bearing covering, if you will, of a
[17]piece of webbing that is sewn way below the attachment
[18]point.
[19]The thinking here is if, for some reason,
[20]even though it's a beveled edge, but if, for some
[21]reason, there was wear in there that we couldn't see
[22]because of the padding, then this would be a rescue
[23]strap of some sort so that it would still be attached to
[24]the chute. Couldn't -- it couldn't release.
[25]Q. Okay. And so what you circled are -- is
75
[1]webbing that goes arou -- essentially, around the -- the
[2]bar and is sewn to the straps that hang down; is that
[3]correct?
[4]A. Correct. And it -- they're non-load bearing so
[5]they're not tight. They're -- they're basically there.
[6]They're pretty loose.
[7]Q. When did Sport Chutes introduce that feature?
[8]A. Again, I -- [*70]  I couldn't tell you. It's been
[9]that way for a long time.
[10]Q. And you refer to a second redundant feature.
[11]Is that the cord?
[12]A. Yeah, so I'll circle it here.
[13]Q. And you just circled that on picture DPE1?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. And what is that --
[16]A. That is --
[17]Q. -- cord to?
[18]A. -- that -- that cord is sewn -- that's a piece
[19]of parachute cord which is sewn to -- and a -- a --
[20]another piece of actually loose nylon webbing, the same
[21]nylon webbing, and that cord goes underneath the nylon
[22]webbing and through the very bottom of the -- of the
[23]carabineer.
[24]So the thinking here was, being a redundant
[25]feature, if, for some reason, unforeseeably, because we
76
[1]do have captive pins, but should a pin back out due to
[2]vibration or just whatever the cause might be, then that
[3]strap is going to be a rescue strap which would only
[4]allow the bar to drop down an inch or two, and it would
[5]hold the bar attached but still maintain that to be
[6]attached to the chute.
[7]Q. When did Sport Chutes add that feature?
[8]A. Again, the same time I did all this.
[9] [*71]  Q. You don't know?
[10]A. I don't know. It's just been an evolution, but
[11]I did all these at the -- at the same time.
[12]Q. Regarding the cord, was there any particular
[13]incident that prompted you to add that to the Sport
[14]Chutes passenger bar?
[15]A. No, I've always -- examining all of my products
[16]-- I've made changes in my harnesses. I've made safety
[17]improvements. Anytime I can develop a new idea for --
[18]especially for redundancy and I'm an airline pi --
[19]aircraft -- I get my pilot's license, and the first
[20]thing they teach you is you've got redundant systems in
[21]an airplane so if one fails -- especially the big
[22]airplanes -- there'd be all kinds of hydraulic redundant
[23]systems. So with that theory in mind, it occurred to me
[24]that we need some redundancy in everything that we
[25]provide because I want to foresee as many eventualities
77
[1]as I can. I think that's a duty of a manufacturer.
[2]And this became apparent to me when I
[3]started studying my products, as I do on a consistent
[4]basis, to see if we can make improvements. Improvements
[5]for the industry to make the products safer to use, more
[6]user [*72]  friendly, anything that -- that we can do which is
[7]going to protect the fliers as much as possible.
[8]Q. But was there any particular incident that
[9]you're aware of that prompted you to add the cord that's
[10]depicted in DPE1?
[11]A. No, I -- I think that the -- the only other --
[12]there was a -- some time ago, Mark Bahr had an accident
[13]with a -- a doubles bar that he had purchased from Sport
[14]Light where it became detached. Apparently, a popper --
[15]it's a totally different design bar, but a -- my
[16]understanding was a popper had came loose, and it
[17]resulted in the accident in a -- a death of a -- a
[18]mother and a daughter. And that's been way back -- way
[19]back in the early maybe 2002 or something.
[20]So based on that, sometimes you don't know
[21]that things could happen until they do happen, and based
[22]on that information, incidences -- you always want to
[23]study incidences because you want to see if there's
[24]something wrong with your product that you could have
[25]done, you could have changed, you could have improved
[78]
[1]that would have prevented that.
[2]And I don't know if that particular
[3]incidence got [*73]  me to thinking about redundant features in
[4]our bar, but I'm always, on a regular basis, continually
[5]trying to improve our product.
[6]Q. So when Chris developed your original bar, he
[7]essentially -- or strike that. When Chris developed the
[8]Sport Chutes' original bars, generally speaking, he
[9]adopted the Waterbird design; is that correct?
[10]A. Yes, which he said he designed for Waterbird in
[11]his deposition.
[12]Q. And so when he designed the Sport Chutes bar,
[13]he adopted the same type of clip assembly that was used
[14]on the Waterbird bar, correct?
[15]A. That's correct.
[16]Q. And, generally speaking, to this date, you're
[17]still selling bars with that same type of clip assembly,
[18]correct?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]Q. And --and --
[21]A. Well --
[22]Q. -- just so the --
[23]A. -- well, with one -- let me -- let me stop you
[24]there but -- just one second -- but the difference here
[25]is that we use only captive pins rather than non-captive
79
[1]pins as what was involved in the accident.
[2]Q. Okay. But as -- as far as the general
[3]components, you've got a -- a -- a shackle welded to [*74]  the
[4]carabineer. That's been a feature of the Waterbird
[5]doubles bar and the Sport Chutes doubles bar from --
[6]from the beginning of the development of --
[7]A. And --
[8]Q. -- the doubles bars?
[9]A. -- yes, and I presume that's still a -- a
[10]component part of the current Custom Chutes doubles bars
[11]from what I've seen as well.
[12]Q. Are you aware of any incidence whether it was a
[13]Waterbird bar, a Custom Chutes bar or a Sport Chutes bar
[14]where a clip assembly came off of the bar during flight
[15]other than the incident involving Victor Rodriguez and
[16]his wife?
[17]A. No, that would be rare.
[18]Q. Well, my -- my question -- my question is are
[19]you aware of any incidents?
[20]A. No, except the only incident I know -- and,
[21]again, I'm not familiar with it -- was somehow the bar
[22]became detached from the Sport Light bar, but I think
[23]that their assembly was different so I can't -- I can't
[24]speak on that particular one. I don't know. Again, I
[25]heard it was a popper that -- that failed, but I don't
80
[1]know.
[2]Q. So you -- you've been in the parasailing
[3]business about 33 years?
[4] [*75]  A. Correct.
[5]Q. The passenger bars were -- came into use in the
[6]mid-'90s about?
[7]A. Well, that's when -- when parasailing -- or the
[8]side-by-side parasailing became pretty hot. Originally,
[9]there was a spreader bar -- called a spreader bar that a
[10]guide that built the boats in Havasu, he kind of came up
[11]with that idea, and so I don't know who came up with it
[12]first -- probably Waterbird -- and just kind of a
[13]simultaneous thing -- but when wench boats came about,
[14]everybody wanted to fly side by side.
[15]Q. Sin -- and since the advent of that, you're not
[16]aware of any other incidents where the clip assembly
[17]came off one or both sides of the bar during flight?
[18]A. No.
[19]Q. Let me -- I do -- always do this, and -- and my
[20]apologies. Get us into double negatives. Are you aware
[21]of any incident since the advent of tandem parasailing
[22]where the clip assembly came off of one or both sides of
[23]the bar during flight?
[24]A. I said no.
[25]Q. Have you ever incorporated in the design of
[81]
[1]your passenger bar a cotter pin on one end of the
[2]shackle?
[3]A. No. You talking about the [*76]  shackle or -- or the
[4]-- you talking about the twist shackle, the bottom --
[5]the -- the pin which would -- a cotter pin to go through
[6]the end of the pin on the twisted shackle. Is that what
[7]you're asking?
[8]Q. Yes.
[9]A. Okay. No, but I know what a cotter pin is.
[10]Q. You reviewed Dr. McSwain's report, and he
[11]talked about a cotter pin?
[12]A. Yes, he did.
[13]Q. Is that a fea -- has that ever been a feature
[14]of a Sport Chutes bar?
[15]A. No, because I don't -- as far as I know, that
[16]type of hardware wouldn't be available for -- for the
[17]marine industry. I've not seen anything like that.
[18]Now, it might exist somewhere, but we've had no problems
[19]with this particular design in the fact that we use a
[20]captive pin rather than a non-captive pin seems to be a
[21]really important factor.
[22]Q. Why is it an important factor?
[23]A. Well, according to Dr. McSwain, he was
[24]explaining that metal could vibrate, and in the
[25]particular bar -- not in my -- he calls his the exemplar
82
[1]bar, the one that I produced, but in the bar that
[2]Detective Meronard was given as the -- the incident bar,
[3] [*77]  there was no bushing in there which allowed the pin to
[4]wallow out that hole. It also allowed the pin to where
[5]the other side of the -- of the twist shackle, where it
[6]went in from -- just from going up and down, it also --
[7]he noted in his report excessive wear on the inside of
[8]the pin.
[9]He referred to it as vibration, and he
[10]also, in his deposition, said that the factory -- the
[11]Wichard factory cautioned to not have to put it into a
[12]situation where there would be vibration because
[13]vibration can cause wear. Wear can cause failure, and
[14]wear can also -- can cause breakage or have that pin
[15]back out --
[16]Q. Okay.
[17]A. -- so …
[18]Q. What do you mean by a captive pin?
[19]A. Well, the captive pin -- can I refer to a
[20]picture here?
[21]Q. Sure.
[22]A. Okay. Let's get a -- see if we can't find a
[23]good one here. Let me get there. Okay. I'm getting to
[24]the clips here I think. Here's a -- a captive pin, and
[25]I believe that this is going to be on the exemplar bar
83
[1]because I showed him a piece of hardware separate.
[2]MR. BEFERA: Hold -- what are you looking
[3]at when you say [*78]  this is a captive pin, please?
[4]MR. BIRENBACH: We're in Ex -- we're in
[5]Exhibit 5, and she just pointed to DP259 --
[6]THE WITNESS: E --
[7]MR. BIRENBACH: -- or 5 -- 529 -- E529.
[8]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Is that correct?
[9]MR. BEFERA: I'm sorry. E529.
[10]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Is that correct?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]MR. BIRENBACH: Yes.
[13]A. 529 and 531.
[14]MS. CHANG: Were you explaining about the
[15]captive pin or --
[16]THE WITNESS: Yes.
[17]MS. CHANG: -- were you done?
[18]A. And shall I continue?
[19]MR. BEFERA: Okay. I have it. Thank you.
[20]A. Okay. A captive pin, as you can see in -- in
[21]E29, it's on the left side there, the pin is still
[22]attached to the twist shackle, and it cannot fall out of
[23]the twist shackle because it's captively held in that --
[24]on -- in this phot -- photograph, it'd be the left side.
[25]The right side is threaded so that's where you would
84
[1]tighten it. You push it all the way through, attach it
[2]to the doubles bar, and then tighten it on the right
[3]side so you can see the threads on the right side.
[4]Again, it won't fall out. A [*79]  non-captive
[5]pin will actually, once you unscrew it, it just slides
[6]right out --
[7]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And it could be --
[8]A. -- and you --
[9]Q. -- lost?
[10]A. -- it could be lost.
[11]Q. And --
[12]A. And you -- and you see that in Detective
[13]Meronard's -- the bar that was presented to him in the
[14]-- as -- as part of the incident and also McSwain has
[15]pictures of the sep -- the two separate pieces, the pin
[16]beside the twist shackle sowing -- showing that they can
[17]be separated.
[18]Q. Does the captive feature of the shackle pin
[19]prevent the pin from backing out?
[20]A. Makes it a lot harder because it's a lot harder
[21]to -- to get it screwed in there. It's not going to go
[22]anywhere. It's just -- it makes it a lot harder for
[23]that assembly because it's not going to -- it's not
[24]going to fall out the back. Not going to just fall out.
[25]It would have to worm it's way out.
85
[1]And, again, I'm -- you're talking a little
[2]bit outside the scope. I'm not a metallurgist, but in
[3]-- in talking with Wichard and also in -- in Chris's
[4]training, that seemed to be an important factor [*80]  is that
[5]you want that pin to be hard to get out of there.
[6]Q. Do you have any information about why the
[7]manufacturer developed that feature of the --
[8]A. That would be --
[9]Q. -- pin?
[10]A. -- outside the scope of my expertise.
[11]MS. CHANG: Can I get the question again?
[12]I don't even think he was done. Sp why did the
[13]manufacturer develop --
[14]MR. BIRENBACH: -- that feature. Well, if
[15]you could read -- I --
[16]MS. CHANG: That feature of a non-captive
[17]pin?
[18]MR. BIRENBACH: Can you read back the
[19]question?
[20](The question was read back.)
[21]MS. CHANG: Okay. I'm just -- objection to
[22]form. I'm not sure which manufacturer or which feature,
[23]but if all of you are in sync, then, you know, I'm just
[24]making my objection for the record.
[25]MR. BIRENBACH: Sure.
86
[1]MS. CHANG: Just --
[2]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And -- and just to clarify
[3]for the record. The -- the manufacturer of the shackle
[4]that's depicted in photograph DPE529 is Wichard --
[5]Wichard?
[6]A. Wichard.
[7]Q. Excuse my French. Do you know why Wichard
[8]developed the feature [*81]  of the shackle that made the pin
[9]captive?
[10]A. No, it'd be presumptive on my part. I -- I
[11]don't know.
[12]Q. With that feature in place, you can unscrew the
[13]pin to release the shackle from whatever it's attached
[14]to, correct?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. You just can't take the pin all the way out?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]MS. CHANG: Is somebody's phone --
[19]THE WITNESS: I think it's probably mine.
[20]MS. CHANG: I think it's his. No?
[21]THE WITNESS: Huh-uh.
[22]MS. CHANG: Maybe it's mine.
[23]THE WITNESS: It's mine, and I must have
[24]something going on. May I look at it?
[25]MR. BIRENBACH: Yes, of course. Off the
87
[1]record.
[2](Break taken at 1:07 p.m. to 1:11 p.m.)
[3]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And continuing to refer to
[4]Exhibit 5 from Dr. McSwain's deposition. There are a
[5]couple other bars that he had photographs of which, at
[6]least according to him, you provided. There's a bar
[7]that I think the photographs at DPE165 are
[8]representative of. Is that a bar that you provided to
[9]him?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. Okay. Who is the manufacturer of the bar
[12]depicted in DPE165? [*82] 
[13]A. Well, Sport -- it's a Sport Chutes bar. We
[14]didn't actually manufacture the bar, but the bar was
[15]made to the specifications.
[16]Q. And I'll call that the copper or gold bar. Is
[17]that fair to say?
[18]A. That's fair to say.
[19]MS. CHANG: It's anodized.
[20]A. It's anodized bar.
[21]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Well, I'm just referring to
[22]the color --
[23]MS. CHANG: Oh, yeah.
[24]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) -- because the -- the next
[25]one that I want to look at is a blue bar. Do you see
88
[1]the blue bar which I think is representative by some
[2]pictures numbered DPE325 and thereon?
[3]A. Yes, sir.
[4]Q. Do you know who the manufacturer of the blue
[5]bar was?
[6]A. Yes, that's a Waterbird bar.
[7]Q. Did you provide Dr. McSwain with a Custom
[8]Chutes bar?
[9]A. I don't know if they came from Custom Chutes or
[10]not.
[11]Q. Okay.
[12]A. And let me --
[13]Q. Are you -- are --
[14]A. -- let me rephrase that. I don't know if they
[15]distributed it, but I can tell it was made by Waterbird.
[16]They may -- I'm -- I'm sure that they sold it because it
[17]came from --
[18] [*83]  MS. CHANG: Who's they?
[19]THE WITNESS: Custom Chutes.
[20]A. I'm sure Custom Chutes sold it because it came
[21]from a customer that we share. It was sent back to me
[22]for a -- a fitting of new straps, and I refused to work
[23]on it.
[24]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) What customer was that?
[25]A. It's a customer in Jamaica.
[89]
[1]Q. What's the name of the operator?
[2]A. That would be a -- the -- Gail Jackson.
[3]Q. As of April 2004, do you have any personal
[4]knowledge as to whether Custom Chutes was manufacturing
[5]any of its own passenger bars?
[6]A. Yes, I do.
[7]Q. And what is your knowledge?
[8]A. Based on Chris's deposition, he imported
[9]everything. He said they didn't start making the bars
[10]until 2007, 2008, and that was -- I -- I didn't know
[11]until he read this -- until I read the deposition.
[12]Q. Do you have any reason to dispute that
[13]testimony of Chris Abbott?
[14]A. At the present time, no.
[15]Q. The bar that you saw pictures of from the
[16]Bahamas, do you have any reason to believe that Custom
[17]Chutes manufactured it?
[18]A. Can you restate the question?
[19] [*84]  Q. Well, let me just ask a different question.
[20]A. Okay.
[21]Q. Who -- who manufactured the bar that you saw
[22]pictures of from the Bahamas?
[23]A. According to the research and the information
[24]provided, apparently, it was manufactured by Waterbird.
[25]It was imported by Custom Chutes. Custom Chutes and
90
[1]then with their invoice from the -- the Waterbird
[2]invoice, indicating that was sold to Custom Chutes.
[3]Custom Chutes, with their invoice, indicated it was sold
[4]to U.S. Parascending Corporation, Mark Bahr. Mark
[5]Bahr's invoice indicating it was sold to Sarah Lihou
[6]with Ocean Motion. To me, that would be the stream of
[7]commerce.
[8]Q. At any point in time, did you indicate to
[9]counsel for Mr. Rodriguez that Custom Chutes was the
[10]manufacturer of the bar depicted in the Bahamian
[11]photographs?
[12]A. I -- I did not indicate that because of the
[13]evidence that was provided to me showed the stream of
[14]commerce.
[15]Q. Beginning with Waterbird?
[16]A. Beginning with Waterbird, correct. And if I
[17]could add one more thing. That bar had a -- and you
[18]could call it a trademark manufacturing aspect, [*85]  which is
[19]the plastic shrink wrap around the web straps, which was
[20]in disrepair, which, to my knowledge, we didn't do.
[21]Nobody does except for that only seen on the Waterbird
[22]bar. And Chris Abbott noted that in his deposition as
[23]well.
[24]Q. So I take it you agreed with that aspect --
[25]A. I agree.
[91]
[1]Q. -- of --
[2]A. -- with that. Yes.
[3]Q. How did you learn about the accident involving
[4]Victor and Crystal Rodriguez?
[5]A. The next day I got a call from Sarah Lihou in a
[6]panic saying, Sandy, I need all of the invoices of -- of
[7]the doubles bars that you sold me, and I said, Sarah, I
[8]don't recall selling you any doubles bars. And she said
[9]-- I said why? What's going on? She says well, we --
[10]we had a fatality, and I was quizzing her what happened,
[11]and she was in a hurry, and she said well, I just -- I
[12]need -- I need the invoices of what you sold me.
[13]At that point, I said okay. Well, let me
[14]look. Let me check my records. She called me early in
[15]the morning. I was still at my house so I was not in
[16]the office.
[17]Q. Do you know if that was the day after the
[18]accident [*86]  or the day of?
[19]A. The day of.
[20]Q. So the call --
[21]A. As I recall, it was the day of, yes. It could
[22]have been -- it could have been the next morning. You
[23]know, I can't -- I can't really recall right now, but it
[24]was very soon, immediately, you know.
[25]Q. Was that on a cell phone?
[92]
[1]A. Yeah, because I had the office number
[2]transferred to my cell phone.
[3]Q. Would there be cell phone records of that call?
[4]A. I wouldn't have them. I don't get a reprint
[5]now any more of calls incoming or outgoing calls in my
[6]phone.
[7]Q. Is that a business line or a personal one?
[8]A. It's a -- it's company line. Plus, I've
[9]changed carriers since then so that would have been
[10]what, five years ago so …
[11]Q. Who was the carrier at the time?
[12]A. I switch pretty often. It could have been
[13]AT&T. It could have been Verizon. I -- I really
[14]couldn't tell you.
[15]Q. Do you have any records which would show who
[16]the carrier was?
[17]A. Not offhand.
[18]Q. So you don't know offhand whether you have
[19]records?
[20]A. No, not offhand, I -- I wouldn't know.
[21] [*87]  Q. Since the incident, how many times have you
[22]spoken to Sarah?
[23]A. She called me back pretty much right away, and
[24]she said never mind, Sandy, don't look for the invoices.
[25]I found the invoice, and I bought the bar from Mark
93
[1]Bahr. I've got the invoice right here. That was the
[2]next call, and then, obviously, we talked about the
[3]accident, and I -- anytime anybody calls me, it's always
[4]been our standard operating procedure to quiz them to
[5]find out the details. And it's just like if an airplane
[6]goes down, you want to be sure that it wasn't anything
[7]that -- that you provided that caused the airplane to go
[8]down, so to speak.
[9]So I started quizzing her, and I said what
[10]happened, and she said she -- she didn't know so we
[11]began discussing the accident, and she said that it was
[12]a beautiful day --
[13]Q. Well, be -- before we get into the details --
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. -- let's -- I just want to figure out how many
[16]calls you have with her, and then we're going to talk --
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. -- in detail about each of the calls. So
[19]that --
[20]A. The --
[21]Q. -- just so [*88]  you know where I'm going. So --
[22]well, you've got the first call where she was looking
[23]for the paperwork --
[24]A. Right.
[25]Q. -- is that right?
94
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. And then she called back and said forget about
[3]it?
[4]A. Right.
[5]Q. And then was there a third call?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. And that's --
[8]A. And that was --
[9]Q. -- the call that --
[10]A. -- the next day.
[11]Q. -- you recorded?
[12]A. Yes. And that was when I was in my office and
[13]I had my -- my records and everything in front of me. I
[14]was able to tape record it, as I do, just matter of
[15]course.
[16]MS. CHANG: Were there any other phone
[17]calls after that?
[18]A. Sarah has called me, off and on, about
[19]purchasing equipment, but other than that not really.
[20]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Okay. It's -- apart from
[21]those first three calls --
[22]A. Right.
[23]Q. -- have you spoken to Sarah about the accident
[24]since the accident?
[25]A. Not that I recall.
95
[1]Q. So any subsequent calls were business-related
[2]in the sense of purchasing equipment?
[3]A. Exactly. [*89] 
[4]Q. Okay. In that -- the -- we're going to go ea
[5]-- through each of the three calls now. The first call,
[6]she just asked you if -- if you had the paperwork for
[7]what?
[8]A. Specifically, the doubles bar.
[9]Q. Did she tell you why she asked specifically
[10]about the doubles bar?
[11]A. She said that they had an accident, and a girl
[12]died, her husband was severely injured, and she needed
[13]to produce that information to her insurance company,
[14]and she wanted to know -- she assumed that the bar had
[15]come from us because we do business with her, but she
[16]does business with everybody, too, so she wasn't sure
[17]where it came from. I don't know who else she called,
[18]but her first call was to me because we've had a
[19]relationship now for a long time.
[20]And I didn't recall selling her a bar, and
[21]I started asking her what happened. She said the -- it
[22]was a -- a beautiful day, and the fliers became
[23]detached --
[24]Q. And wait. Wait.
[25]A. -- from the bar.
96
[1]Q. Wait. So you're about to talk about what she
[2]told you?
[3]A. Yes.
[4]Q. Was that in the first call?
[5] [*90]  A. Yes.
[6]Q. Okay. So continue. Tell me what she told you
[7]in that --
[8]A. Okay.
[9]Q. -- first call.
[10]A. She was puzzled. She didn't know how this
[11]accident occurred. She was asking my opinion, as a
[12]professional in the industry, and based on my
[13]experience, how could of an accident of this have
[14]happened, and I asked her what did happen, and she said
[15]the two fliers and the doubles bar became detached from
[16]the parachute and fell into the water from 60 feet.
[17]Q. Did she tell you anything else in that
[18]conversation?
[19]A. Just, again, it was -- it was just kind of
[20]brief because she was in a panic at that point looking
[21]for an invoice and also the shock of what had just
[22]happened.
[23]Q. In that first conversation, did you ascertain
[24]where Sarah was at the time of the accident?
[25]A. I don't believe that she was present or saw
97
[1]anything. She was not in an area where she had any
[2]personal knowledge of the accident.
[3]Q. Did you ascertain in that first conversation
[4]how she obtained her knowledge of what happened?
[5]A. From her husband and the boat driver.
[6] [*91]  Q. So at least as far as you were able to
[7]determine, Sarah's knowledge came from reports of the
[8]boat driver and her husband?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. Are you aware of any of her other sources of
[11]knowledge, if any?
[12]A. That's just what she told me. The boat driver
[13]told me that this happened.
[14]Q. Did she distinguish between information
[15]reported by the boat driver and her husband?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. And her husband, as far as you're aware, is
[18]Ricardo Rolle?
[19]A. That's correct.
[20]Q. And you -- you've known them to be husband and
[21]wife for many years?
[22]A. Yes, I think they were probably boyfriend and
[23]girlfriend when I first met her a long time ago.
[24]Q. And the only reason why I ask was because I've
[25]been re -- calling her Sarah Rolle but others have been
98
[1]calling her --
[2]A. Lihou.
[3]Q. -- Lihou. But they're -- they're the same
[4]person?
[5]A. Yes, they are.
[6]Q. Okay. And do you know that by personal
[7]knowledge?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. Have you told me everything that you recall
[10]about that first conversation with Sarah?
[11] [*92]  A. No.
[12]Q. What else do you recall?
[13]A. Well, the main thing I wanted to establish was
[14]did she have any issue -- well, I wanted to know whose
[15]parachute was involved, and she said it was your
[16]parachute. And I said whose harnesses were involved?
[17]She said it was your harnesses. And I said do you have
[18]any issues with my parachute or my harnesses? She said
[19]absolutely none.
[20]I said there's no failures, and I went
[21]through the whole scenario even drilling her to -- to be
[22]sure that there wasn't something there that I needed to
[23]be aware of, as a safety issue, so we would either need
[24]to correct something in our manufacturing or put out a
[25]safety bulletin or contact our clientele to say hey,
99
[1]we've had an accident here, this and this failed, and we
[2]need to modify, correct, recall, amend, whatever.
[3]Trying to be a prudent operator or manufacturer so the
[4]operators would know that there has been an accident,
[5]but she said there's absolutely no issue.
[6]The parachute was fine. The parachute was
[7]not damaged in the -- in the accident, and it was the --
[8]she keyed in on the doubles bar right away. [*93]  All she
[9]wanted to know was about the doubles bar.
[10]Q. Did she indicate to you why she keyed in --
[11]and in your words -- on the doubles bar?
[12]A. Because the two fliers and the doubles bar
[13]became separated from the parachute, and they were still
[14]wearing their harnesses which were still attached to the
[15]doubles bar. The doubles bar was separate from the
[16]chute.
[17]Q. Completely separate?
[18]A. Completely separate.
[19]Q. According to her?
[20]A. According to her, yes, and they, quote/unquote,
[21]according to the driver, fell from the sky.
[22]Q. So according to Sarah's information, it -- it
[23]didn't -- the -- the bar didn't separate on one side or
[24]the other but separated on both sides where it attaches
[25]to the parasail?
100
[1]A. That's was my deduction. Now, that could have
[2]been a series of events. It could have separated on one
[3]side and then the second side much like the video that
[4]we showed one to the other, but since she was not
[5]present, she didn't have a whole lot of personal
[6]information about it. She was relying on what the boat
[7]driver, edited or unedited, told her.
[8] [*94]  Q. Did you determine in your conversation -- that
[9]first conversation -- whether Sarah had an opportunity
[10]to personally see any of the equipment that was in use
[11]on the date of the accident?
[12]A. Was -- you talking about the equipment that
[13]they surrendered to the detective?
[14]Q. Right. Exactly.
[15]A. Well, she said the tow bar was initially
[16]missing, and she explained that it had drifted away, and
[17]that she and her crew looked endlessly for this tow bar,
[18]were not able to recover it. And the tape-recording of
[19]the second day was after they had found it. It showed
[20]up on a shore, and they called the detective, and he
[21]recovered it from the water.
[22]Q. Was Sarah present during the recovery?
[23]A. I'm not sure. It's in Meronard's testimony,
[24]but I believe that it was Ricky Rolle, her husband, that
[25]called them and told them we found the bar. It's in the
101
[1]water.
[2]Q. Do you have any information indicating that
[3]Sarah Rolle was present when the bar was recovered?
[4]A. I -- I'd have to reread that particular
[5]deposition or report from the detective because I --
[6]right now, I can't [*95]  recall.
[7]Q. So your only information would be contained in
[8]the testimony of Sergeant Meronard. There was nothing
[9]that she told --
[10]A. She --
[11]Q. -- you that indicated she was present when the
[12]bar was recovered. Is that fair to say?
[13]A. She didn't elaborate on that particular aspect.
[14]It didn't seem too important at the time. We were --
[15]she was more interested in letting me know we found a
[16]bar, and that's when we talked about the screw was her
[17]-- well, her exact -- I'd have to look for her --
[18]Q. Well -- well --
[19]A. -- exact --
[20]Q. We'll -- we'll come back to that.
[21]A. Yeah.
[22]Q. I mean, we're going to go through that --
[23]A. The clip open.
[24]Q. -- taped conversation in detail. But what
[25]about the other equipment? Were you able to ascertain
102
[1]from speaking to her -- and I'm referring to Sarah --
[2]whether she -- she was -- saw any of the equipment that
[3]was turned over to Sergeant Meronard, as he described in
[4]his deposition, before it was actually turned over?
[5]A. Yeah, she said that immediately afterwards, the
[6]chute and the -- the people [*96]  were still in the harnesses,
[7]and they -- medical personnel were wanting to cut their
[8]harnesses off and -- and she didn't want them to. So
[9]the people were still wearing the harnesses when they
[10]came to shore. The chute was abandoned in the water
[11]with the rope, and she said apparently the boat driver
[12]unclipped the -- the -- the -- the fliers, brought them
[13]to shore, and then went back and got the chute and the
[14]equipment and brought that to shore.
[15]Q. Okay. Was she present on shore in the area
[16]where Victor and Crystal were taken?
[17]A. Can you be more specific for me?
[18]Q. Sure. I'm -- all I want to know is if you have
[19]any information as to whether Sarah Rolle actually laid
[20]eyes on any of the equipment that was in use?
[21]A. Yes, because she told me that my chute was not
[22]damaged, that there was nothing wrong with the chute and
[23]there was nothing wrong with the harnesses. So she had
[24]to have made a visual inspection at that point because
[25]she was emphatic there was nothing wrong with the chute.
103
[1]There was nothing wrong with the harnesses, and it was a
[2]doubles bar that came detached.
[3] [*97]  Q. But did she actually tell you that she made a
[4]visual inspection of the chute?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. And she said she saw it before it was turned
[7]over to the police?
[8]A. Well, she just said that, you know, I've seen
[9]the chute, and there's nothing wrong with the chute, and
[10]that I didn't really quiz her any further than that that
[11]she saw it wasn't anything wrong so she told me.
[12]Q. And when -- in which conversation did she say
[13]that?
[14]A. That would have been in the -- in the initial
[15]one because I was most concerned about that, seeing as
[16]if my equipment was involved in the accident.
[17]Q. Did you ask her when she saw the chute before
[18]it was turned over?
[19]A. No, I -- I didn't know. She just said there's
[20]noting wrong with the equipment. I assure you the chute
[21]did not cause the accident. The harnesses are intact.
[22]There was nothing wrong with the harnesses. I wanted --
[23]Q. Well, there -- you --
[24]A. -- to be sure there was no failures of any
[25]straps or any obvious things that I needed to be aware
104
[1]of at that particular moment.
[2]Q. And -- and I appreciate that. [*98] 
[3]A. Uh-huh.
[4]Q. I just want to know whether you're aware of
[5]whether she actually saw the chute after the accident
[6]and before it was turned over to the police?
[7]A. Well, I -- I believe I've answered that. I --
[8]I -- I don't know because I never really answered that
[9]que -- I never asked her that question. I just know
[10]that -- that she had said that she saw it, and
[11]everything was fine.
[12]Q. Do you know where she saw it?
[13]A. No.
[14]Q. Is there anything else that you recall about
[15]that first conversation with Sarah that you haven't told
[16]me about?
[17]A. Well, just to elaborate, she was at a loss to
[18]explain how the accident occurred. She was searching
[19]for do you know? Do you have an idea? We're at a loss
[20]here. We don't know. I don't know. How could this
[21]have happened?
[22]Q. Did you offer her any information on how it
[23]could have happened?
[24]A. I had no opinion because I had no information
[25]at that point.
105
[1]Q. Okay. Then --
[2]A. Oh, the -- the only -- pardon me. One
[3]correction there. The only thing I knew about a doubles
[4]bar failure was this [*99]  particular one that had happened
[5]years ago in the Strainey case -- I believe it was the
[6]Strainey case -- where the tow bar from Sport Light had
[7]separated and had two fatalities. At that point, I
[8]didn't know if the tow bar was a Sport Light tow bar or
[9]was a Waterbird tow bar because it came from U.S.
[10]Parascending, and they've sold both.
[11]Q. Moving onto the -- well, let me just ask one
[12]more time to see if I've exhausted your memory about --
[13]A. Okay.
[14]Q. -- the conversation and pardon the procedure.
[15]But is there anything else about that first conversation
[16]that you remember that you haven't told me about?
[17]A. Offhand, if I think of something, I will let
[18]you know.
[19]Q. Perfect. The second conversation, when did
[20]that take place to the extent you remember?
[21]A. Just pretty much real soon after that. She's
[22]look -- don't look for it anymore. I -- I know it's a
[23]U.S. Parascending bar. I've got the invoice. I know
[24]when we bought it, and I started quizzing her about that
[25]when did you buy it, and we talked a little bit a --
106
[1]about the fact that it came from Mark Bahr.
[2] [*100]  Q. And at that -- that point in time, you still
[3]didn't know if it was a Sport Light bar or a Waterbird
[4]bar, correct?
[5]A. Exactly.
[6]Q. At that point in time, you consider that it
[7]possibly could be a Sport Light bar; is that right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. When did you rule out the fact that it wasn't a
[10]Sport Light bar?
[11]A. Several days later, Detective Meronard called
[12]me, and he was in possession of the equipment, which was
[13]turned over to him, and he called me because he had no
[14]level of expertise, as far as the component parts -- a
[15]doubles bar, the chute, the harnesses, the rope -- he
[16]had those specific items in his possession.
[17]He was reaching out to me to see if I could
[18]explain what they were and how they worked and how they
[19]connected. His initial concern was there was a chain of
[20]custody question for the bar, and he wanted to know is
[21]there any reason why a bar would become detached from a
[22]parachute to where it could not be found until 24 hours
[23]later, and he was very extremely concerned about that
[24]and highly suspicious.
[25]Q. And just backing up for a second because I
107
[1] [*101]  forgot to ask. You had mentioned that Sarah reported it
[2]in the first conversation that equipment was left in the
[3]water; is that right?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. And that included the chute; is that right?
[6]A. Correct.
[7]Q. And the passenger bar?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. And then they went back --
[10]A. And the rope.
[11]Q. And the ro -- the -- when you say rope, the tow
[12]line?
[13]A. Tow line. Correct.
[14]Q. And so -- so they went back and retrieved that
[15]equipment after and they brought Victor and Crystal to
[16]the beach according to Sarah Rolle?
[17]MS. CHANG: Well, not the bar.
[18]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Well --
[19]A. Correct. But the bar was missing at that
[20]point.
[21]Q. Right. And I -- I appreciate that. I think I
[22]asked they went back to retrieve it. So they were able
[23]to retrieve the tow line and the chute but not the bar
[24]when they went back --
[25]A. Correct.
108
[1]Q. -- according to her?
[2]A. And the fliers were wearing the harnesses.
[3]That is the complete assembly.
[4]Q. And, again, I apologize for jumping around.
[5]Back to the second [*102]  conversation, have you told me
[6]everything that you recall about that?
[7]A. As far as I can recall at the moment.
[8]Q. The third conversation is the recorded
[9]conversation; is that right?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. And that took place after the bar was retrieved
[12]from the water the next day as far as you're aware?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. Because she said in that conversation that the
[15]bar had been retrieved, correct?
[16]A. Correct.
[17]Q. And we know from Sergeant Meronard at least
[18]that the bar was retrieved the next day?
[19]A. Correct.
[20]MR. BEFERA: If you -- just a quick
[21]question here, Folks. Does anybody have a copy of the
[22]McCulloh report with the color photographs because I'm
[23]looking at black and white.
[24]MS. CHANG: Yes, we do.
[25]MR. BEFERA: Would it be possible for you
109
[1]to e-mail me a copy?
[2]MS. CHANG: Now, that I can't do because I
[3]only have a hard copy of it. I don't have it on my
[4]laptop.
[5]MR. BEFERA: Okay. Fair enough. All
[6]right. I'll just have to deal with it. Thank you.
[7]MR. BIRENBACH: If we have a break, Steven,
[8]I -- I [*103]  probably can e-mail it.
[9]MR. BEFERA: Okay.
[10]MR. BIRENBACH: But it -- I -- I haven't
[11]turned my computer on so --
[12]MS. CHANG: I'll -- let me see if I can try
[13]to do it by searching for it on my mail. Oh, hold it.
[14]I do think that someone just e-mailed it to me. Hold
[15]on. But go ahead. Don't let me stop you.
[16]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[17]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Between the first phone
[18]call and the third phone call that was recorded, did you
[19]contact Mark McCulloh?
[20]A. Yes, I did.
[21]Q. Why?
[22]A. Because I -- I wanted to know had he heard of
[23]the accident. He, again, manages the -- the parasail
[24]safety organization, parasail.org. That's his website,
[25]and, generally, he'll get a -- a hundred calls if
110
[1]there's a horrific incident like this, and he and then
[2]will list it on his website, and he collects his data so
[3]that the industry can -- can learn from potential
[4]problems or failures. It's -- it's a -- a collection
[5]point of information for the public and for the
[6]commercial operators.
[7]Q. When you contacted him, what did he say?
[8]A. He said he hadn't heard of [*104]  it, and that he was
[9]concerned about the incident.
[10]Q. Any specific concerns other than the fact that
[11]Crystal perished and Victor was injured?
[12]A. Yes, and severely injured and -- and so the de
[13]-- degree of --
[14]Q. Of what? I mean, what were his concerns?
[15]A. Just the puzzling aspect of what -- what
[16]happened. None of the -- the facts made sense to
[17]anybody.
[18]Q. Which facts didn't make any sense?
[19]A. Well, how -- how the tow bar could become
[20]detached and cause an accident.
[21]Q. Because that wasn't something that had occurred
[22]as far as either of you were aware in the industry?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. Anything else that Mark said during your
[25]conversation with him in-between the calls with Sarah?
111
[1]A. Yes, he -- he said to have Sarah call him so
[2]that he could assist her in the investigation part of it
[3]since he had been called many times to investigate these
[4]sorts of incidents, and that he would help her to the
[5]best of his ability to figure out what happened and --
[6]and to offer advice on how to handle everything.
[7]Q. Why did you record your third conversation [*105]  with
[8]Sarah?
[9]A. Just a matter of course of business. We always
[10]did that. Curtis knows we recorded everything. For
[11]one, we want to be sure that somebody doesn't change
[12]their story later on and try to blame a piece of
[13]equipment when they initially said you had nothing to do
[14]with this accident. And for investigative purposes on
[15]-- on my part, since my memory's not so good, I can
[16]replay that, and I can analyze it and -- and remember
[17]exactly what was said. So it's just a -- a course of
[18]business --
[19]Q. Did you --
[20]A. -- for us.
[21]Q. -- did you ask Sarah permission to record?
[22]A. No, we don't need that in Texas. As long as
[23]one party is aware of the recording, then it's perfectly
[24]legal to do so, and I was aware that I was recording it.
[25]MR. BIRENBACH: Steven, we're a copy of the
112
[1]recorded conversation --
[2]MR. BEFERA: Okay.
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: -- or the transcript of
[4]recorded conversations.
[5](Exhibit No. 3 was marked.)
[6]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Ms. Clark, I'm handing you
[7]what's been marked as Exhibit 3.
[8]A. Yes, sir.
[9]Q. Have you [*106]  seen that before?
[10]A. Yes, I have.
[11]Q. What is it?
[12]A. This is a transcript of the recorded
[13]conversation I had with Sarah Lihou Rolle.
[14]Q. On page 5, line 18 --
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. -- do you see where Sarah says it was in the
[17]air, period. I mean, comma, the chute didn't go down,
[18]period?
[19]A. Yes, I see that.
[20]Q. What did you understand that to mean?
[21]A. Let me back up so I can read the context
[22]leading up to that, if we could.
[23]Q. Absolutely.
[24]MS. CHANG: Steve, I'm sending you the
[25]report right now.
113
[1]MR. BEFERA: Okay. That wasn't -- the
[2]report was marked Exhibit 2?
[3]MS. CHANG: No, I'm sending you McCulloh's
[4]report.
[5]MR. BEFERA: And I know. But this -- what
[6]was Exhibit 2 that you marked at this depo?
[7]MS. CHANG: I -- I don't know. Does it
[8]matter?
[9]THE WITNESS: Yes.
[10]MS. CHANG: It was McCulloh's report.
[11]MR. BEFERA: That's what I thought.
[12]MS. CHANG: Is that McCulloh's --
[13]THE WITNESS: It's -- yeah.
[14]MS. CHANG: -- report? Okay. It's coming
[15]to you. It's --
[16]MR. BEFERA: [*107]  Thank you.
[17]MS. CHANG: I think it was Exhibit -- I
[18]don't know. Okay. It's coming to you.
[19]MR. BEFERA: Thank you.
[20]MS. CHANG: This is the last task I do for
[21]you today.
[22]MR. BEFERA: You're doing a great job, and
[23]I appreciate it. The next time I'm in L.A., I'll get
[24]you some wine.
[25]MS. CHANG: I'm a great -- I'm a great
114
[1]assistant today, aren't I? Okay. Go ahead.
[2]A. I'm ready.
[3]MS. CHANG: Yeah.
[4]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) So my question again --
[5]well, I -- strike that. I take it you've had an
[6]opportunity to look at the context of lines 18 through
[7]19 on page 5; is that right?
[8]A. Correct.
[9]Q. It's referring to those two lines. What did
[10]you take that to mean?
[11]A. It means the chute didn't cause the accident.
[12]The chute didn't go down and cause the accident.
[13]Q. Well, did it -- did you take it to mean that
[14]the chu -- that the chute didn't go down at all after
[15]the accident?
[16]A. No, it's just that -- what she, in layman's
[17]terms, I -- I think was telling me is that the chute
[18]didn't go down. It -- it didn't cause the accident
[19] [*108]  because we were talking about was there any panels blown
[20]out, was there any damage, was there -- you know, I was
[21]leading up to this.
[22]These were all the things that she had
[23]repeated to me in the -- or had told me in the previous
[24]conversation that I was reiterating, and she was talking
[25]about the -- the fact that the weather was perfect.
115
[1]Everything was fine. There was no problems. And I said
[2]there's no fault to the chute whatsoever, and he said
[3]no, the chute didn't go down. Didn't fail is what she
[4]was saying. And that's why I kept with that continuing
[5]that line of questioning, and the D-rigs, everything was
[6]intact. Nothing torn. Yep, that's the first thing we
[7]looked at. Then she said we looked at it --
[8]Q. She --
[9]A. -- so that's why I know she looked at it.
[10]MS. CHANG: Steven, it rejected because
[11]it's too big for your e-mail so I'm going to send you a
[12]link to it.
[13]MR. BEFERA: Wow, an extra step. Thank
[14]you.
[15]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Now, re -- moving on to
[16]page 7 of Exhibit 3 --
[17]A. Okay.
[18]Q. -- on line 2, do you see where you said okay
[19]and then [*109]  you found the doubles bar some time later,
[20]comma, and, apparently, the screw was open and exposing
[21]the -- dash, dash -- the open clip, and then Sarah says
[22]yeah. Do you see that?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. What were you referring to when you said the
[25]screw was open and exposing the open clip?
116
[1]A. That's what she had told me was that the -- the
[2]clip was undone.
[3]Q. And what clip did you understand that she was
[4]referring to when she told you that?
[5]A. Be the bottom half of the clip assembly where
[6]the -- the -- the captive pin or the -- actually, the
[7]non-captive pin was.
[8]Q. Did you come to an understanding or a
[9]conclusion about how that observation was made?
[10]A. By she saw it. She told me she saw it.
[11]Q. And when you are talking about the clip
[12]assembly, we're talking about the shackle carabineer
[13]combination, correct?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. Where did she see that the screw was open?
[16]A. She's talking about the captive pin that that
[17]was gone, and the clip was open.
[18]Q. Where was the clip found?
[19]A. Well, she didn't tell me that. At the -- you
[20] [*110]  have to understand, at this particular time, I didn't
[21]know what bar she was talking about. I had no idea. I
[22]didn't know if it was a Sport Light bar or Waterbird bar
[23]or something -- Custom Chutes. I had no idea what Mark
[24]Bahr had sold her so I had nothing to compare it to.
[25]She said we found a bar, and that's when she told me
117
[1]that the screw was open and in -- it was exposing the
[2]open clip.
[3]Q. You understand that plaintiffs are claiming in
[4]this case that one clip on one side of the bar came off
[5]the bar during flight? Do you understand that to be the
[6]claim?
[7]A. I'm not sure.
[8]Q. Well, assume that is the claim. What would
[9]happen to the clip in that scenario?
[10]MS. CHANG: Which clip?
[11]MR. BIRENBACH: The clip that comes off one
[12]side of the bar.
[13]A. Well, again, that's an extremely ques -- easy
[14]question to answer because it would -- I, personally,
[15]had that simulated when I flew in the chute, and my
[16]ex-husband was driving the boat. What happens is that
[17]side, whether it's a strap of the harness or a clip
[18]assembly of a doubles bar, if that becomes detached on
[19]one [*111]  side, that riser with the ring on it will elevate to
[20]the point and continue on where it was once at 9:00
[21]o'clock, 3:00 o'clock, depending on what side you're
[22]talking about, it would elevate past 6:00 o'clock -- I
[23]mean -- sorry -- past 12:00 o'clock in either a
[24]clockwise or counterclockwise rotation until that chute
[25]actually turned up over upsidedown and collapsed and was
118
[1]driven into the ground in what would -- for parachute
[2]terminology -- be called a lockout position.
[3]And that chute would crash into the water
[4]at a high rate of speed because it's actually speeding
[5]up and going into the water, whether anybody's attached
[6]or not. And if they became detached, the video clearly
[7]shows that the chute has lost its pendulum weight, and
[8]it -- it looks like it's collapsed which was the
[9]testimony of people on the platform and some people in
[10]the -- on -- on the beach.
[11]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Okay.
[12]A. That's what they thought they saw. People fell
[13]out and the chute collapsed, which is consistent with
[14]the video that we produced as a visual example of one
[15]side releasing, and then if the other [*112]  side releases, the
[16]whole chute will apparently appear to collapse, and the
[17]flier falls to the water.
[18]Q. So, as -- as far as you're aware, Waterbird tow
[19]bars have two clip assemblies, one on each side,
[20]correct?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. And they're attached to the bar using a pin in
[23]the shackle, correct?
[24]A. Correct. Should be, though, in my opinion, a
[25]non -- a captive pin rather than a non-captive pin --
119
[1]plus, there was a lot of other issues with that
[2]particular bar some of which we've --
[3]Q. Okay.
[4]A. -- talked about, some we haven't.
[5]Q. So -- so there's two connection points on the
[6]bar?
[7]A. Correct.
[8]Q. A -- shackles on each end?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. And then, in flight, the carabineer part of the
[11]clip assembly is attached to the D-rings on the yoke of
[12]the parasail, correct?
[13]A. No, they're attached to the D-rings on the
[14]risers which are connected to the yoke of the parasail.
[15]Q. All right. It's -- but they are connected to
[16]the parasail?
[17]A. Correct.
[18]Q. So, basically, the passenger bar serves as the
[19]connection [*113]  between the harnesses and the parasail in
[20]tandem flight?
[21]A. Correct.
[22]Q. So if the clip assembly comes off on one end,
[23]the end from which it comes off will still be attached
[24]to the D-rings on the vertical risers of the parasail?
[25]MS. CHANG: Hold on --
120
[1]A. Can you repeat that?
[2]MS. CHANG: -- one second.
[3]A. Yeah, you lost me.
[4]MS. CHANG: Well, just one second. Can I
[5]have it reread before I object, and I may not object. I
[6]just have to have it reread.
[7](The question was read back.)
[8]MS. CHANG: Just objection to the form but
[9]you can answer if you can.
[10]A. I'm -- I'm confused by your question. If you
[11]could restate it, it'd help me out a bunch.
[12]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Well, you've got a shackle
[13]connected to a bar, correct?
[14]A. Correct.
[15]Q. And then you have the carabineer connected to a
[16]D-ring, correct?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. If the shackle releases from the bar --
[19]A. Yes.
[20]Q. -- where does the carabineer end up?
[21]A. Carabineer, in theory, should end up with the
[22]chute on the D-ring, in theory, unless it [*114]  was damaged or
[23]broke or had some kind of metallurgic failure, perhaps,
[24]or was not clipped in properly. One would assume that
[25]it would be with the chute.
121
[1]Q. That being the case, did it make sense to you
[2]that Sarah Rolle said that the bar was found with the
[3]screw open exposing the open clip?
[4]A. I think what she was talking about there was
[5]the bottom of the -- of the clip assembly, if you will,
[6]the -- the shackle because that would be the open part.
[7]Q. Was the bar that was found the next day, as far
[8]as you're aware and from what you've read, including
[9]Sergeant Meronard's testimony, found with a missing
[10]clip?
[11]A. Can you just repeat that to be sure I answer
[12]that right?
[13]Q. Well, you've had the opportunity to read
[14]Sergeant Meronard's testimony, correct?
[15]A. Correct.
[16]Q. And he was present when a bar was retrieved
[17]from the water, correct?
[18]A. That is correct.
[19]Q. And you had an opportunity to speak to Sarah,
[20]correct?
[21]A. Yes, sir. Uh-huh.
[22]Q. Based on your conversation and in Sergeant
[23]Meronard's testimony, were you able to conclude [*115]  whether
[24]or not the bar that was retrieved from the water the
[25]next day had both of its clip assemblies?
122
[1]A. Yes, it did.
[2]Q. Do you have any explanation for that if the
[3]clip assembly on one side of the bar came off during
[4]flight?
[5]A. Well, my -- since I wasn't present and I have
[6]no firsthand -- firsthand knowledge, what I would say is
[7]Sarah's repeating what the boat driver told her that he
[8]saw, and when the tow bar was recovered, it had two
[9]clips on it, and that was a puzzling aspect is how could
[10]a tow bar with intact clips become detached from the
[11]parachute. That was a puzzling aspect of it, and she
[12]was reaching out to me for do you know how this could
[13]happen, and I said no, I don't know how that could have
[14]happened. It would have to be physically detached which
[15]is a -- a near impossibility for the fliers to do so.
[16]You couldn't do it, and why would it be.
[17]So the tow bar itself had two clips when
[18]Meronard recovered it, and my presumption is they were
[19]added because the date code did not match the date of
[20]the bar.
[21]Q. So based upon what you have seen, the bar [*116]  that
[22]was retrieved from the water the next day did not have
[23]its original clips?
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. And how -- how do you know when that bar was
123
[1]originally manufactured from -- by Waterbird?
[2]A. Because Sarah said she only had two bars, and
[3]she produced the invoice from U.S. Parascending
[4]indicating when she purchased them.
[5]Q. Did she say that she only had two bars anywhere
[6]in the recorded conversation?
[7]A. No, that was the prior conversation because she
[8]asked me specifically. I bought two bars. I bought two
[9]bars. I've only got two bars. I need the invoices for
[10]those bars.
[11]Q. Were you able to come to any conclusion about
[12]why the clips were replaced?
[13]A. Well, I think they were fearful of -- I don't
[14]know who did it. I don't know if Sarah has been an
[15]honest person with me -- I don't know if she knew. I
[16]don't know at what point who knew what, but at some
[17]point, they were replaced, and my presumption would be
[18]to out of fear that they were going to be in trouble
[19]because something had failed and they covered it up so
[20]they had to provide something which would [*117]  be a plausible
[21]explanation of -- of why they wouldn't be in any kind of
[22]trouble. See, the bar's intact. The parachute's
[23]intact. The harnesses are intact. We're not at fault
[24]here. Was something else.
[25]Q. You made that deduction based on the date code
124
[1]on the clips; is that right?
[2]A. Not only that but the fact the chain of custody
[3]that Meronard was extremely concerned, as I would be,
[4]too, and anybody, that a doubles bar would be missing.
[5]And if I could elaborate, I agree with Christ Abbott,
[6]and I agree with Mark Bahr, that if you're evacuating
[7]passengers, especially in the panic of an accident
[8]situation, they would be clipped to the bar. The bar
[9]would be clipped to the chute. You would not take the
[10]time to take the bar off of the chute and then take the
[11]-- the fliers off of the bar.
[12]That would not be a standard operating
[13]procedure or any kind of a safety briefing that you
[14]would give your crew. The clips come off -- the body
[15]harness clips come off the tow bar quite easily. You
[16]just unclip them, and they're done. You can evacuate
[17]the people. Common sense would say you leave [*118]  that
[18]equipment. You take care of your fliers and render
[19]whatever first aid you can, get them to shore, get them
[20]medical attention, and you would go back and retrieve
[21]the parachute and whatever you had with the tow line.
[22]Even if it sank a little bit, you can pull it up with
[23]the rope. So everything should have been attached.
[24]And there's -- according to Chris's
[25]testimony and Mark Bahr's testimony -- and I do agree
125
[1]with this -- there is no reason that somebody would
[2]detach or take the time, especially in that situation,
[3]to detach the doubles bar. There's just no explanation
[4]for that. And, certainly, the other thing is why it
[5]would have drifted off. They know that bar's expensive.
[6]It's several hundred dollars, five or six, whatever they
[7]paid for it, five, six hundred bucks. And that would be
[8]a piece of equipment which he should, as a boat driver,
[9]want to preserve, and plus, the fact that it's an
[10]expensive piece of equipment and to let it float off, as
[11]he said it did, is very puzzling.
[12]Q. Is it your opinion that the clips that were
[13]seen on the recovered bar were not the original clips [*119]  to
[14]that bar?
[15]A. That's my opinion.
[16]Q. And is -- is that true of both of the clips?
[17]A. Yes, they both have the same date code.
[18]Q. Do you have an explanation why they would have
[19]replaced both clips?
[20]A. Probably because they both were damaged or
[21]missing or parts, thereof, were missing.
[22]Q. Well, were the -- was there any evidence that
[23]you saw that the clips that were put on after, as you --
[24]you opine, were damaged?
[25]A. I'm sorry. You lost me in the question.
126
[1]MS. CHANG: Yeah. Are you saying are the
[2]new ones that were -- the 2005 one damaged?
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: Yes.
[4]A. Yes, one of the 2005 ones would not close. The
[5]-- the top portion of the carabineer would not close to
[6]so that it could be screwed shut. The other one was in
[7]-- intact as far as it has been reported.
[8]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Have you been able to
[9]ascertain where Ocean Motion obtained the 2005 clips?
[10]A. I would -- no, I don't know firsthand, but I
[11]would assume that they would have been purchased through
[12]Custom Chutes.
[13]Q. In what context?
[14]A. Well, [*120]  because they would have -- they purchased
[15]-- according to their invoice, they had extra clips that
[16]they purchased from Waterbird so they had them in
[17]inventory, and if a customer called up needing an
[18]inventory part, they would sell it.
[19]Q. Is there any evidence that you saw in this case
[20]that Custom Chutes sold clips to Ocean Motion after
[21]April of 2004?
[22]A. That evidence is, as of yet, undiscovered.
[23]Q. Have you seen any evidence of Custom Chutes
[24]selling anything directly to Ocean Motion between April
[25]of 2004 and June 16th of 2011?
127
[1]A. Again, that evidence is yet undiscovered.
[2]Except that -- and let me put one qualifier on there --
[3]except that Chris Abbott, in his deposition, did mention
[4]that Sarah was a customer of theirs --
[5]Q. As --
[6]A. So …
[7]Q. -- as of when?
[8]A. I -- I'd have to refer back to the deposition,
[9]but he said that Sarah Lihou that they had sold her
[10]equipment and was a customer of theirs.
[11]Q. Did --
[12]A. At some point, Mark Bahr stopped selling the
[13]equipment so …
[14]Q. And Sarah was a customer of yours as well?
[15] [*121]  A. Yes, and she -- she called me up six months ago
[16]trying to buy equipment and then called me back and said
[17]no, she was going to purchase it from Customer Chutes.
[18]So I have firsthand knowledge from Natasha in her office
[19]that they were doing business with Custom Chutes at that
[20]point at least.
[21]Q. The --
[22]A. But that wasn't before --
[23]Q. The --
[24]A. -- this.
[25]Q. Do you have any way of knowing whether the
128
[1]clip, that was originally installed on the bar, had a
[2]captive pin?
[3]A. It's not there. I have no idea.
[4]MR. BIRENBACH: Let's take a break.
[5](Break taken at 2:08 p.m. to 2:11 p.m.)
[6]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) I take it from your
[7]testimony, Ms. Clark, that it's your opinion that
[8]neither of the shackles were -- that were seen on the
[9]bar that was recovered were original to the bar; is that
[10]correct?
[11]A. Well, I can't say they weren't original to that
[12]bar. I'm just saying that they couldn't have been sold
[13]to the bar that was purchased in 2004 because the date
[14]codes just don't match.
[15]Q. Could the bar have been purchased subsequent to
[16]2004? [*122] 
[17]A. I'm sure that's possible, but due to the
[18]condition of the bar and the wear points of the
[19]wallowing out, the overall deterioration of the aluminum
[20]because there was no anodizing or powder coating, the --
[21]the straps -- the covering of the straps, it was very,
[22]very worn. But was that a bar that was purchased in
[23]April 9th or April 10th or I -- I -- you know, I don't
[24]know.
[25]Q. Well, the --
129
[1]A. But it was old. Very old.
[2]Q. -- the -- the stamp on the carabineers
[3]indicated that the carabineers were manufactured in
[4]2005?
[5]A. That's correct.
[6]Q. Could the bar have been bought in 2005?
[7]A. Well, it's -- that would be, yet,
[8]undiscoverable because we have no evidence of what was
[9]sold after that fact up to 2011 as far as I was able to
[10]ascertain. That's un -- undiscoverable at this point.
[11]Q. So you don't know whether Ocean Motion bought
[12]bars after 2004?
[13]A. She said she didn't. She said she only bought
[14]two.
[15]Q. And that's the only information you have?
[16]A. Based on her personal knowledge, yes.
[17]Q. And according to her, she bought [*123]  -- and we're
[18]talking about Sarah -- Sarah said to you that the only
[19]bars she had were the bars that she bought from Mark
[20]Bahr in 2004; is that right?
[21]A. Right, because she originally, on the first
[22]call, wanted the invoice for the two bars that she had
[23]purchased. I bought two bars. Sandy, I need the
[24]invoice for those two bars that you sold me. I said I
[25]don't remember selling you any bars. Well, I have two
130
[1]bars and I -- I believe I got them from you. I said I
[2]don't know. Don't remember that but I'll look.
[3]Q. Do you have any information about when Ocean
[4]Motion attained the clip assemblies with the 2005 stamp?
[5]A. No, I do not. Again, that's, yet,
[6]undiscoverable. I just know that Custom Chutes did buy
[7]those separately, and like me, they could easily have
[8]them made here in the States. You can buy the
[9]carabineers from Suncor Stainless, which they knew was
[10]my supplier of that, and the Wichard twisted shackle,
[11]which they knew was a supplier of mine. So they could
[12]have made them themselves if they wanted to. They
[13]didn't necessarily have to buy them from anyone.
[14]Q. Well, I'm [*124]  asking about when Ocean Motion would
[15]have obtained them. Do you have any information about
[16]how Ocean Motion obtained the carabineers with the 2005
[17]dates?
[18]A. No, I never asked Sarah about replacement clip
[19]assemblies.
[20]Q. So I take it it's your testimony that if the
[21]bar that was recovered was the bar that was in use it
[22]was not in its original condition when it was recovered?
[23]MS. CHANG: You mean, not in the original
[24]condition when it was sold, you mean?
[25]MR. BIRENBACH: No, when it was recovered,
131
[1]it was no longer in its original condition. It had new
[2]parts.
[3]A. Something changed, yes.
[4]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Do you agree that even with
[5]a captive pin, if the pin comes out or loosens over
[6]time, the clip assembly can release from one end or the
[7]other of the bar?
[8]A. Yes, obviously, because you have to have some
[9]way of installing it, don't you? It's got to clear that
[10]gap so that you can put it on. The point being is that
[11]the captive pin is a whole lot harder because it's not
[12]going to fall out.
[13]Q. But it can come out to the point where one end
[14]of [*125]  the bar can release -- well, strike that. The pin
[15]could come out far enough for one end of the bar to
[16]release?
[17]A. I think I know what you're asking, and it --
[18]again, I'll answer it the same way. The -- the pin has
[19]got to clear the span of the bar to be able to install
[20]it, but the span on the bars that I have being, SAU
[21]versus metric, it's very hard to put that on, and as a
[22]consequence, the captive pin, especially held in with a
[23]bushing, it doesn't have much room to move or vibrate so
[24]that it's going to back out on its own.
[25]Q. Does the captive feature of a captive pin
132
[1]prevent the pin from coming out of the threaded side of
[2]the shackle?
[3]A. No, it has to do with the other side.
[4]Q. And in reviewing Mark McCulloh's report, the
[5]theory that's been proffered in this case was that the
[6]pin came out of the threaded side of the shackle,
[7]correct?
[8]A. It became unscrewed. Yes. That's what Sarah
[9]Lihou said, too.
[10]Q. And the -- the captive feature of the captive
[11]pin -- pin wouldn't prevent it from coming out of the
[12]threads, correct?
[13]A. Well, yeah, it wouldn't [*126]  pre -- it'd prevent it
[14]from falling out of the assembly.
[15]Q. But it wouldn't prevent it from coming out of
[16]the threads, correct?
[17]A. It wouldn't prevent it from coming out of the
[18]threads -- you talking about on the opposite side?
[19]Q. No, on the threaded side. Nothing's -- the
[20]captive feature doesn't prevent me from --
[21]A. Unscrewing that --
[22]Q. -- screwing the --
[23]A. -- it, no, no. Correct. It's just it -- as
[24]you see right here from your moving that around, it
[25]still leaves a little bit in there that you've got to
133
[1]really -- got to really wallow out to get off the -- the
[2]doubles bar. The captive pin, it's really hard to get
[3]that onto the doubles bar which means that it's really
[4]hard to get it off.
[5]Q. Have you ever seen, in operation, one of your
[6]bars with a -- a shackle pin out of the threads?
[7]A. I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.
[8]You're asking me if I seen a pin loose?
[9]MS. CHANG: Out of the threads.
[10]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Loose -- okay. Well, I'll
[11]ask it loose. Have you ever seen a captive pin loose in
[12]the threads on one [*127]  side of the shackle?
[13]A. I never have. No. And on my bars -- let me
[14]just elaborate -- when the girls install them, we put
[15]them in a -- in a vise grip and actually twist them. We
[16]don't use pliers. We actually put them in a vise grip,
[17]and we -- we use the torque of the bar to get them in
[18]really, really solid, and we advise the customer to
[19]check them regularly.
[20]Q. After the third conversation with Sarah Rolle,
[21]when was your next conversation with anyone about the
[22]incident involving Victor and Crystal Rodriguez?
[23]A. Was when Detective Meronard called me and
[24]wanted me to explain how the component parts came
[25]together and what he was looking at and sharing his
134
[1]concern about the chain of custody, sharing his concern
[2]about the general dilapidated appearance of the bar and
[3]wanted to know is this -- is this the correct way to
[4]make a bar. We had a conversation about that, and I
[5]pointed out all the deficiencies in the fact that I felt
[6]whoever sold that bar had gross negligence in selling
[7]that bar because, first, and most obviously, it wasn't
[8]anodized or powder coated.
[9]Q. Did the [*128]  -- did the lack of anodization or
[10]powder coating, in your view, cause the accident?
[11]A. Yeah. Well, the -- Dr. McSwain alleged --
[12]alleged that because of the deterioration of the pin and
[13]the fact that -- that it was corroded and that there was
[14]no bushings in there, and even Chris Abbott's testimony
[15]is he didn't put bushings in there. That was a retrofit
[16]for a repair.
[17]And he said even when he started to make
[18]his own doubles bar in 2007 and 2008, they didn't put
[19]the bushings in there, and then they charged them 60
[20]bucks a piece to put them in and -- and so that was a
[21]profit center I guess for him to retrofit or repair the
[22]bars. And then he said, at some point, they decided
[23]well, we might as well put them in in the original
[24]manufacture but --
[25]Q. Let me -- let me just ask you the question this
135
[1]way. Are you going to testify at trial that the lack of
[2]anodization or powder coating caused this accident?
[3]A. I can't, but Dr. McSwain's testimony --
[4]Q. I'm as -- I'm asking about you. Dr. McSwain
[5]will --
[6]A. Would --
[7]Q. -- speak for himself.
[8]MS. CHANG: [*129]  Do you think that the lack of
[9]non-anodization or powder coating somehow contributed to
[10]the --
[11]A. Yes. Yes.
[12]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And what is your basis for
[13]that belief?
[14]A. Because it -- the pin -- if -- if you -- if you
[15]-- if you have a -- a pin in a dilapidated situation
[16]with corrosion and you have another piece without the
[17]bushing in there, it -- it's loose and the vibration --
[18]Q. I'm not asking about the bushing. I'm asking
[19]about the powder coating.
[20]A. Well --
[21]MS. CHANG: I think she's getting there.
[22]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[23]MS. CHANG: I think she is getting there.
[24]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[25]MS. CHANG: Just get to the anodization.
136
[1]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[2]MS. CHANG: Okay. Go ahead.
[3]A. Okay. So if you don't have that protected,
[4]then it is subject to the -- the conditions that it's
[5]being operated in, i.e., sea water, salt water, which is
[6]very corrosive, as we know, to aluminum that's not
[7]protected. That allows everything to corrode. It
[8]becomes abrasive. It's bad for the webbing. It's bad
[9]for the pins, and the pins will [*130]  actually start wallowing
[10]out that hole, and the vibration of that can cause them
[11]to back out on their own.
[12]And that testimony was something which I
[13]know, and you can see the -- the holes are wallowed out
[14]here, and Dr. McSwain indicated that in his conclusions
[15]as well as the concern of Wichard that a vibration can
[16]back the pins out. That was some kind of a warning in
[17]their literature.
[18]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) You're not a mechanical
[19]engineer, correct?
[20]A. I am not.
[21]Q. Are -- you're not a metallurgist, are you?
[22]A. No, I'm not. I've just had 33 years of
[23]experience in looking at this stuff and being in the
[24]industry.
[25]Q. And you've never before seen a single pin back
137
[1]out of a shackle on a tow bar, correct?
[2]A. I'm not an operator so I wouldn't be privy to
[3]that information.
[4]Q. Have you heard of that ever happening?
[5]A. Pins can get loose. Yes.
[6]Q. But have you heard of that happening --
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. -- with a --
[9]A. Yes.
[10]Q. -- passenger --
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. -- bar?
[13]A. Yes. Pins have --
[14] [*131]  Q. Tell --
[15]A. -- come loose. Yes. They can get loose.
[16]That's why they need to be checked.
[17]Q. And has there ever been an incident where the
[18]pin came completely out causing a accident?
[19]A. It's outside the scope of my investigation. I
[20]don't know.
[21]Q. Are you familiar with any literature about the
[22]types of vibrations that can cause threaded fasteners to
[23]become loose?
[24]A. Again, that's outside the scope of my
[25]expertise.
138
[1]Q. Are you -- have you done any testing to derm --
[2]to determine the types of vibrations that can cause a
[3]threaded fastener to become loose over time?
[4]A. No, just common sense. If you've got a hole
[5]that's too big, it's going to cause vibration. That's
[6]the only thing from a layman that I can tell you who's
[7]not a metallurgist or a mechanical engineer or some kind
[8]of authority on metal.
[9]Q. But you agree that those issues are better
[10]addressed by someone like Dr. McSwain, correct?
[11]A. Absolutely.
[12]Q. And you're not going to testify at trial about
[13]the types of vibrations that can --
[14]A. No.
[15]Q. -- cause a threaded [*132]  fastener to come loose --
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. -- right? That's outside of your expertise?
[18]A. Right.
[19]Q. You're not a scientist, right?
[20]A. No.
[21]Q. Are -- are you a scientist?
[22]A. No, I'm not.
[23]Q. Are you an engineer?
[24]A. No, I am not.
[25]Q. You have an advertising degree?
139
[1]A. I do.
[2]Q. So -- so you told me about your three calls
[3]with Sarah. You told me about your call with Sergeant
[4]Meronard. When did you next get involved with this
[5]particular accident in one form or another?
[6]A. The next thing I heard was that Mark went over
[7]there to take a look at everything on his own and met
[8]Meronard, and he just called me and told me that he was
[9]shocked at the condition of the gear, particularly the
[10]doubles bar. He'd never seen anything like that nor had
[11]-- Meronard was shocked at the condition of the doubles
[12]bar, and I was, too, when I saw the pictures, and I
[13]instantly knew that it was not a Sport Light bar. That
[14]it was definitely a -- a Waterbird bar.
[15]But, again, I would never have sold a bar
[16]to a customer in that condition -- the [*133]  original
[17]condition, and the points in Mark McCulloh's -- there's
[18]several points here what -- what I felt was negligent in
[19]doing so.
[20]Q. But you had sold Waterbird bars in the past,
[21]correct?
[22]A. They were always powder coated. And probably a
[23]couple. Not many because of the -- the -- the
[24]commercial industry was at a infancy in that point, you
[25]know, it was just getting developed in early '90s, and,
140
[1]of course, Chris came on in -- in '95 when we started
[2]building the boats, and then we had the whole vertical
[3]integration. We had the chutes. We had the boats. We
[4]had the bars. We had whatever they needed to get going
[5]on it.
[6]Q. So -- so the Waterbird bars that Sport Chutes
[7]sold were the only difference between the bar is that
[8]the Waterbird bars it sold and the one that was
[9]recovered is the powder coating; is that right?
[10]A. No, that's not true.
[11]Q. What were the other differences?
[12]A. Well, there was no bushing in the bar. The
[13]ones we got from Waterbird always had bushings. They
[14]had bushings. They were ano -- they were powder coated
[15]at that point. We later anodized [*134]  them which is a
[16]different chemical process. The -- let me refer --
[17]MS. CHANG: Padding.
[18]A. Yeah, then they were padded. They were always
[19]padded from Waterbird. We had them -- we had them
[20]padded.
[21]MS. CHANG: Beveled.
[22]A. Yes, and the insides needed to be beveled. Do
[23]you remember where the -- explained how the strap goes
[24]through the bar, that needs to be beveled, and the main
[25]reason is if it's not beveled, it has a 90 degree edge,
141
[1]and if it weren't powder coated or protected with anodiz
[2]-- ano -- an -- anodizing, then the bar could corrode
[3]and actually act like sandpaper on the -- on the webbing
[4]and cause a failure, which you see here.
[5]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Okay. Are you going to
[6]testify at the trial of this case that the lack of a
[7]bevel on the recovered bar was the cause of the
[8]accident?
[9]A. No.
[10]MS. CHANG: The cause or a cause?
[11]MR. BIRENBACH: The cause.
[12]A. Not the cause, no.
[13]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Was it a cause?
[14]A. Could have been if it caused the strap to break
[15]which straps have broken before.
[16]Q. Well, did you [*135]  see any evidence that a strap
[17]broke?
[18]A. No, strap did not break on the bar that was
[19]surrendered.
[20]Q. Have you ruled out that a strap broke on the
[21]bar that was in use?
[22]A. Yes, and I'll tell you why. Because the
[23]rotation was, what we term in the industry, as a vicious
[24]rotation. Everybody testifies to that. The -- the
[25]young man and his dad on the platform, the people on the
142
[1]shore. Everybody says the canopy looked like it
[2]collapsed and they fell. So whatever happened was
[3]instantaneous and vicious.
[4]A strap breaking is going to -- depending
[5]on where -- where it breaks -- is going to cause some
[6]kind of a rotation, but it's not going to cause a type
[7]of rotation where if the assembly just comes totally
[8]loose from the parasail. It's going to be a different
[9]situation, and I have talked to operators in the past
[10]who have had straps break, and it doesn't cause a
[11]fatality. And, in fact, this particular bar here, if we
[12]want to refer to this one, was returned to me with a --
[13]with a strap broken, and it didn't cause a fatality as
[14]evidence.
[15]Q. When was your next involvement [*136]  in the case?
[16]A. After?
[17]Q. After you spoke to Mark?
[18]A. After Mark, we continued to chat about it, and
[19]then, eventually, we were both retained by Deborah
[20]Chang.
[21]Q. How many times have you met with Debbie?
[22]A. I believe it's twice. I believe twice.
[23]Q. Including yesterday?
[24]A. Yes. Today would be three.
[25]Q. So -- so not including yesterday -- or excuse
143
[1]me. My -- my math --
[2]A. In -- including this --
[3]Q. -- is bad. Currently, who are your competitors
[4]in the parasail industry.
[5]A. Well, obviously, my ex-husband and Chris Abbott
[6]owning Custom Chutes would be one. There's probably a
[7]-- a Waterbird and in England, Sport Light,
[8]internationally, and there may be one or two companies
[9]that pop up and domestically, but as far as commercial
[10]business, they're really not a factor. Mainly, in the
[11]U.S., it would be Sport Chutes and Custom Chutes.
[12]Q. When did Chris go to work for Custom Chutes?
[13]A. Well, he never went to work for Custom Chutes.
[14]Q. Do you have an understanding of his position at
[15]Custom Chutes?
[16]A. Yeah. [*137] 
[17]Q. What is his position as far as you're aware?
[18]A. You mean back then when it first organized or
[19]today?
[20]Q. When it was first organized.
[21]A. Well, after he stole all that stuff from me and
[22]pled guilty to felony theft before that, he went off to
[23]Florida -- well, let me -- let me back up. In --
[24]MS. CHANG: Well, I think the question was
[25]very clear. Could you just reread the question?
144
[1](The question was read back.)
[2]MS. CHANG: What's his position?
[3]A. His position first organized was that he was a
[4]manager, and he went into business with a customer of
[5]mine who bank rolled that. So Custom Chutes did not
[6]exist until he, and Brian Beady -- I mean, Mr. Beady --
[7]I can't think of his first name.
[8]MS. CHANG: I -- I think his question --
[9]THE WITNESS: Oh.
[10]MS. CHANG: -- is what's his position.
[11]A. He's -- he was a manager.
[12]MS. CHANG: Manager. There we go.
[13]A. And that's what he said in his depo, too.
[14]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Has the competition with
[15]Custom Chutes over the years affected the business of
[16]Sport Chutes?
[17] [*138]  A. Well, sure.
[18]Q. How so?
[19]A. Well, any time you -- you have competitors
[20]emerging or dropping out, it's going to affect the
[21]business. When Mark Bahr quit selling chutes, that
[22]affected the business, too, because there was less
[23]suppliers. So if you have a new supplier come on to the
[24]scene, obviously, that's going to be more competition
[25]for that available dollar.
145
[1]Q. Are you aware of when Curtis started at Custom
[2]Chutes?
[3]A. In May of 2002.
[4]Q. How did you become aware of that?
[5]A. Well, it was a -- a day after we got divorced
[6]and his non-compete agreement was up. It was May 10th
[7]or something.
[8]Q. Since Curtis has been with Custom Chutes, have
[9]you seen a drop off in the Sport Chutes business?
[10]A. What business?
[11]MS. CHANG: In your business he's saying.
[12]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) In your business.
[13]A. Right, but, I mean, I -- I have several
[14]businesses --
[15]Q. The -- the --
[16]A. -- under Sport Chutes.
[17]Q. -- the parasailing.
[18]A. I have the leisure business, and I have the
[19]commercial.
[20]MS. CHANG: In any of [*139]  them.
[21]A. In -- in sewing.
[22]MS. CHANG: Any of it.
[23]A. Yeah, it's been up and down.
[24]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) You mention that Chris
[25]stole from you. What did he steal?
146
[1]A. Chris stole intellectual property. He stole
[2]patterns to chutes. He stole --
[3]MS. CHANG: It's -- it just was so long
[4]ago. Do you really --
[5]A. -- raw goods. Yeah.
[6]MS. CHANG: -- want to relive the whole
[7]thing?
[8]A. I mean, you know, it just --
[9]MS. CHANG: It's -- there's been documents.
[10]He's paid his debt. Do you really want to go through
[11]it?
[12]MR. BIRENBACH: Is she going to testify
[13]about it at trial?
[14]MS. CHANG: If you don't bring it up, I
[15]don't think she intends to bring it up because it's so
[16]old. It's -- was 20 years ago.
[17]MR. BIRENBACH: If that's a stipulation,
[18]then I'm fine.
[19]MS. CHANG: I don't think she's going -- or
[20]do you have any --
[21]A. That's a long time ago. I'm -- I'm --
[22]MS. CHANG: And, frankly, you know what --
[23]A. -- way beyond that.
[24]MS. CHANG: -- she told me -- I'll just
[25]share this with you -- not that [*140]  I want to testify -- is
147
[1]that the better he does, the better future she thinks
[2]her children have. He's been good to her daughter, paid
[3]for her wedding, all this other stuff. How can he --
[4]she deny the father of her children success so --
[5]MR. BIRENBACH: The -- but just so it's
[6]clear on the record. If you're saying that you're going
[7]to stipulate to not bring up that past --
[8]MS. CHANG: All the horrible things? I --
[9]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay, Debbie.
[10]MS. CHANG: She told me in her own words he
[11]paid his debt. He -- he -- he paid in the criminal. He
[12]paid her in a civil case. She does not intend to bring
[13]it up. Am I correct? It's --
[14]THE WITNESS: That's correct.
[15]MS. CHANG: -- her -- it's her story to
[16]tell, not mine.
[17]MR. BIRENBACH: But -- but what I need as
[18]an attorney --
[19]MS. CHANG: Yes -- here. Here. Can I get
[20]you some water?
[21]MR. BIRENBACH: No, no, no, I'm good.
[22]MS. CHANG: It's all empty. You've drained
[23]it. Can we get him a bottle of water so we don't -- I
[24]don't want to do the Heimlich right now. I'm tired.
[25]MR. BIRENBACH: I need a [*141]  stipulation that
148
[1]you're not going to bring up the criminal prosecution at
[2]trial; otherwise, I'm going to explore it.
[3]MS. CHANG: Okay. All right. I -- I --
[4]MR. BIRENBACH: Is that a stipulation?
[5]MS. CHANG: -- I can -- I will talk to her
[6]and -- but, right now, yes, I will -- it -- it's her
[7]really that doesn't, but I believe -- do you want me to
[8]talk to her now off the record or do you want me to --
[9]MR. BIRENBACH: Sure.
[10]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[11]MR. BIRENBACH: We'll go outside.
[12]MS. CHANG: Well, no.
[13]MR. BIRENBACH: Off the record.
[14](Break taken at 2:46 p.m. to 2:48 p.m.)
[15]MS. CHANG: Back on the record. It will be
[16]my strong suggestion that the parties will stipulate
[17]that all of the -- what I call ancient history that's
[18]been pretty well known between Chris Abbott and between
[19]Sandy Clark will not go -- is not relevant to this
[20]trial, will not be brought in to it, and that will
[21]prevent you from asking questions. If, however, Ervin
[22]Gonzales or Patrick Montoya disagree with me, then we
[23]will certainly proffer her for a second portion of the
[24]deposition where [*142]  you can explore those areas, but I
[25]believe that my suggestion will be adopted --
149
[1]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay. Perfect.
[2]MS. CHANG: -- because -- to add because we
[3]both agree that it would take days to go through all of
[4]everyone's versions of those ancient events. Okay.
[5]Moving on.
[6]MR. BIRENBACH: That just saved us about an
[7]hour.
[8]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) The distributor -- the
[9]distributorship with -- between Sport Chutes and
[10]Waterbird, why was that ended?
[11]A. Well, we were purchasing the gear from
[12]Waterbird and reselling it. We started to have some
[13]problems with the way the chutes flew that Vince, who
[14]was second generation owner, wasn't fixing or
[15]addressing, and we move -- we bought a new building so
[16]now for the first time in the history of Sport Chutes we
[17]had the physical space and the office space to handle
[18]the manufacturing end of things. So it all sort of came
[19]together when we bought the building in '94.
[20]Q. When was the distributorship relationship
[21]formally ended?
[22]A. Well, I stopped buying from them along that
[23]period, and I -- I have a letter in my file [*143]  somewhere
[24]from Vince Gaskin I believe in '9 -- in August of '98
[25]severing that relationship officially in paper.
150
[1]Q. Did you continue to stock Waterbird product
[2]after the relationship ended?
[3]A. I didn't have any Waterbird product when the
[4]relationship ended because I've been building my own
[5]stuff. I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have done that.
[6]MR. BIRENBACH: Just mark this as just one
[7]exhibit.
[8](Exhibit No. 4 was marked.)
[9]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) I'm going to hand you
[10]what's been marked as Exhibit 4 --
[11]A. Okay.
[12]Q. -- which consists of a few e-mails and a -- a
[13]letter on Waterbird letterhead.
[14]A. Right.
[15]Q. Can you -- can you just tell me if you've ever
[16]seen those documents before?
[17]A. Let's see here. This is to Curtis on April
[18]23rd of 2002.
[19]MS. CHANG: Do you have another copy by any
[20]chance? And what businessman is using AOL mail I ask
[21]you?
[22]A. Yes, I'm familiar with this.
[23]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Are -- are you -- have you
[24]seen the e-mails before?
[25]A. Yes.
151
[1]Q. Have you seen the Waterbird letter [*144]  before?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. When did you see those?
[4]A. They're part of my business records.
[5]Q. How did they become a part of your business
[6]records?
[7]A. They're just part of my business records. I
[8]couldn't tell you. They're part of my business records.
[9]Q. Well, the e-mails are between Vince Gaskin --
[10]A. That's right.
[11]Q. -- right? And -- and Curtis Clark --
[12]A. Right.
[13]Q. -- is that right?
[14]A. Uh-huh.
[15]Q. How did they become part of your records?
[16]A. They were just part of my records. They were
[17]there. I can't tell you.
[18]Q. They just showed up in your records?
[19]A. They were -- I did my investigation and found
[20]that letter when I was going through a bunch of stuff
[21]and that was a --
[22]MS. CHANG: Well, I mean, clearly, I think
[23]Waterbird wanted it out to --
[24]THE WITNESS: Yeah.
[25]MS. CHANG: -- prevent a lawsuit. I'm sure
152
[1]probably your client gave it to her so he wouldn't --
[2]she wouldn't sue him is what the e-mail seems to be
[3]implying.
[4]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Did you ever access
[5]Curtis's e-mail? [*145] 
[6]A. No.
[7]MR. BEFERA: Do I have a copy of this
[8]somewhere?
[9]MS. CHANG: No, this seems like some
[10]scurrilous, you know --
[11]MR. CLARK: Uh-huh. It sure is.
[12]MS. CHANG: -- like, you know --
[13]THE WITNESS: Rabbit trail.
[14]MS. CHANG: -- rabbit trail.
[15]MR. BEFERA: No, I -- I don't know what it
[16]is, but if it's marked as an exhibit, I'd sure like to
[17]see it.
[18]MS. CHANG: I'm sure he'll send it. The
[19]court reporter will give it to you, but I can read it to
[20]you.
[21]MR. BIRENBACH: We'll -- we'll get you a
[22]copy, Steven but --
[23]MS. CHANG: Do you want her --
[24]MR. BIRENBACH: Do -- do --
[25]MS. CHANG: -- to just -- I think the
153
[1]question was holding stock from Waterbird. Do you want
[2]her to address that in the letter.
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: Well, then no, I --
[4]MS. CHANG: I'm just trying to get to the
[5]bottom line here.
[6]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) The -- the first question
[7]before that is --
[8]MS. CHANG: Uh-huh.
[9]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) -- do you have any
[10]explanation how the e-mails became part of your business
[11]records? [*146] 
[12]A. No, other than maybe Vince sent them to me. I
[13]don't know.
[14]MS. CHANG: And is it relevant to any --
[15]THE WITNESS: Yes.
[16]MS. CHANG: -- issue in this case? Really
[17]-- it's really honest --
[18]THE WITNESS: It's been four -- it's been
[19]what, 14 years ago from 2002.
[20]MS. CHANG: Are you really now bringing up
[21]between ex-husband and wife how they each got each other
[22]e-mails and stuff? Well, honestly, in this case, I
[23]don't think it really will move the ball down the field;
[24]however, this is your chance to ask her. If you want to
[25]ask her, go ahead. Do you want to ask about e-mails? I
154
[1]mean, she said no so --
[2]MR. BIRENBACH: I just have to go through
[3]my notes.
[4]MS. CHANG: Okay. All right. I'm not
[5]rushing you. I'm just -- I'm going to miss one of those
[6]flights, but that's all right. You said 45 minutes, so
[7]based on that, I've been communicating with my travel
[8]agent.
[9]MR. BIRENBACH: But I also said that I'm
[10]terrible at estimating.
[11]MS. CHANG: Right, but I cannot miss this
[12]hearing tomorrow.
[13]MR. BIRENBACH: We're almost done.
[14] [*147]  MS. CHANG: Okay. Because I will offer her
[15]up for a second gladly any time.
[16]MR. BIRENBACH: We're not going to make her
[17]come back.
[18]MS. CHANG: I knew you guys didn't finish
[19]Mark McCulloh's either so --
[20]MR. BIRENBACH: Off the record.
[21](Break taken for less than one minute.)
[22]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) In the April 2004 time
[23]frame, did Ocean Motion contact you to purchase
[24]parasailing equipment?
[25]A. I -- I can't recall because I -- at that point,
155
[1]I wasn't the only one who answered the phone. I had a
[2]-- a sales manager and another employee that would have
[3]been able to access the phone lines as well. It's just
[4]been too long ago.
[5]Q. Not to beat around the bush on this --
[6]A. Uh-huh.
[7]Q. -- in Mark McCulloh's original report --
[8]A. Uh-huh.
[9]Q. -- he -- he indicated that Ocean Motion bought
[10]bars from U.S. Parascending, quote, because Sandy did
[11]not have any available bars at that time, un -- unquote.
[12]Did you provide --
[13]A. It's a --
[14]Q. -- him with that information?
[15]A. -- that's a possibility, but I just -- it's
[16]been so [*148]  long ago I honestly can't remember, but the --
[17]the bars were something that -- that we didn't have a
[18]ready stock of all the time. We had to have them made
[19]up in groups of 12 to be cost effective so we were
[20]frequently out of stock. It wasn't a big selling item
[21]for me.
[22]MS. CHANG: I'm reading this e-mail.
[23]Aren't men like compadres? Boys stick together, don't
[24]they? No, problem. I'll send a letter. I wonder if
[25]women would do that.
156
[1]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Did -- did Sport Chutes
[2]ever at any time sell passenger bars to Ocean Motion?
[3]A. No.
[4]Q. As of April 9, 2004, do you know how many
[5]passenger bars Ocean Motion had?
[6]A. I wouldn't have firsthand knowledge. Just
[7]based on what Sarah told me, two.
[8]MS. CHANG: Which in a way is personal
[9]knowledge.
[10]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[11]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Have you ever seen any of
[12]the complaints filed by Victor Rodriguez in this case?
[13]A. By -- I'm sorry -- who?
[14]Q. Victor Rodriguez.
[15]MS. CHANG: Our client. My client.
[16]A. Oh. Have I seen the complaint?
[17]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) The actual --
[18] [*149]  A. The -- the actual --
[19]Q. -- legal doc --
[20]A. -- lawsuit?
[21]Q. Right.
[22]A. I do not believe so.
[23]Q. There is an allegation in paragraph 163 of the
[24]second amended complaint indicating experts have opined
[25]that the doubles tow bar is not the bar that failed. Do
157
[1]you know if you're one of the experts who opine that?
[2]A. Well, I think that can be deduced from my
[3]conversations with Mark that -- that's -- that whatever
[4]was produced, be it the bar or the bar with these clips,
[5]that there's no way that that whole assembly, if you
[6]will, was involved in the accident as it was presented
[7]because one clip is damaged, but other than that, the
[8]whole bar is there. The clips are there. The bar is
[9]there. The straps are there. Everything is intact.
[10]MS. CHANG: And the date code.
[11]A. Yes, and the -- and the date code of -- of the
[12]clips doesn't match the age of the bar.
[13]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Are you going to offer any
[14]testimony at trial where Ocean Motion obtained the clips
[15]that are seen on the recovered bar?
[16]A. I'm sorry. You're going to have to repeat
[17]that. [*150]  You lost me there.
[18]Q. Are you going to offer any testimony at trial
[19]on where Ocean Motion obtained the clips that were seen
[20]on the recovered doubles bar?
[21]A. No.
[22]Q. Because you don't know, right?
[23]A. I don't know. The only thing I do know is that
[24]their carabineer on the doubles bar they presented is an
[25]Italian made carabineer. The carabineers that I put on
158
[1]my doubles bar, Water puts on theirs, and I presume
[2]Custom Chutes on theirs, it's all the same carabineer,
[3]and the other piece is all the same Wichard twisted
[4]shackle. So the assemblies are identical, and where
[5]they would have purchased that at a later date, I
[6]couldn't tell you.
[7]Q. Based on your experience in the industry, if
[8]the accident happened on July -- excuse me -- June 16th,
[9]2011, was it possible for them to get the clip
[10]assemblies the -- by the next day if they didn't already
[11]have them?
[12]A. Well, one would assume that if they did that
[13]that it'd have a later date code. It would have at
[14]least 2011 because who would have inventory that would
[15]be six years old.
[16]MS. CHANG: Then I guess the [*151]  question is
[17]would it be possible for them to get them the next day
[18]if they didn't have them already in the industry?
[19]THE WITNESS: Yes.
[20]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) It would have been
[21]possible?
[22]A. I'm sure -- I'm sure.
[23]Q. From where?
[24]A. Well, I -- I would assume that they go to
[25]Custom Chutes and get them from them or at that point,
159
[1]Mark Bahr was out of the selling -- reselling the
[2]equipment business.
[3]MS. CHANG: Can you get them overnight?
[4]THE WITNESS: If they're -- if you have
[5]them in stock made up, and at that point Custom Chute
[6]was building those bars so they would have them in
[7]inventory I would presume.
[8]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) With a 2005 date code?
[9]A. You'd have to -- that's undiscoverable. I -- I
[10]don't know. I would doubt that but who knows.
[11]Q. But that would be something that Curtis and
[12]Chris could --
[13]A. Would --
[14]Q. -- clear up?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. Is Curtis notorious for cutting corners?
[17]A. Is Curtis notorious for cutting corners? Naw,
[18]he's -- he's been thorough. He doesn't cut corners.
[19]Q. Was [*152]  Curtis a good business partner?
[20]A. Yes, he was a good business partner.
[21]Q. Good father to your kids?
[22]A. He's been a good father to the children. Yes.
[23]In fact, we talked often about our son right now. I
[24]talk to him all the time about our son, and he's helped
[25]out our son, and I need to talk to him again about our
160
[1]son.
[2]Q. As of June 16th, 2011, did Sport Chutes carry
[3]liability insurance?
[4]A. I -- I couldn't tell you. That's been what,
[5]five years ago. We'd had liability insurance for most
[6]of the Sport Chutes inception. At that point, I
[7]couldn't tell you if we did or we didn't, but, you know,
[8]how it goes. If you get a frivolous lawsuit, everybody
[9]wants to drop you, and then once you have a -- a claim
[10]even for defense work, it's hard to regain that
[11]insurance from another market, but some of the insurance
[12]I know does carry on. I -- I get confused about claims
[13]made, policies versus occurrence, and so it depends on
[14]when things were sold and when they were, you know,
[15]alleged in a -- in a lawsuit I suppose.
[16]Q. Are you or is -- is Sport Chutes a member of
[17]any parasailing [*153]  industry associations?
[18]A. We have been in the past -- well, boating
[19]association stuff, but currently, no.
[20]Q. When were you -- when was Sport Chutes or you,
[21]personally, a past member of a boating or parasailing
[22]association?
[23]A. I couldn't tell you. It's been a number of
[24]years. I -- I feel like the associations really don't
[25]do a lot for the industry. I do attend the seminars and
161
[1]whatnot, but as far as, you know, we -- we could join if
[2]we wanted to. It just didn't seem to be an important
[3]thing. There's only one anyway which is not recognized
[4]by the whole industry.
[5]Q. Which one is that?
[6]A. W-S-I-A. WSIA they call it.
[7]Q. Have you participated on the ASTM Committee for
[8]parasailing?
[9]A. I've been asked to. I've chosen not to.
[10]Q. Who asked you?
[11]A. Oh, bunch of people ask me.
[12]Q. Who?
[13]A. Matt Davorek. Joel -- I mean, there's been
[14]just various leaders in the industry have asked me to --
[15]to partake of that. Aquatic Adventures, James Vaught,
[16]they've encouraged me to do that. I've -- I worked with
[17]the Coast Guard, though. The Coast [*154]  Guard's called me a
[18]lot of times on various issues --
[19]Q. But why --
[20]A. -- safety issues and whatnot.
[21]Q. -- why did you opt not to work with the --
[22]A. Mainly --
[23]Q. -- ASTM committee?
[24]A. -- mainly, timing and the fact that it's more
[25]on the operation side of like, you know, how much wind
162
[1]can you fly in on this particular day if your sea is so
[2]forth, and it's some specific stuff that I wouldn't have
[3]any, you know, practical knowledge of because I'm not an
[4]operator. I'm on the manufacturing side of things, and
[5]the guys are very -- by and large, the captains out
[6]there are extremely experienced, and they would know a
[7]whole lot more about when to operate and not to operate
[8]and how to operate than -- than I would or any
[9]salesperson would -- me or Curtis or Chris or anybody
[10]because we're not on the front lines everyday, and
[11]that's more what that was for.
[12]Q. In the past five years, has Sport Chutes ever
[13]exhibited at any conventions?
[14]A. Yeah.
[15]Q. Which ones?
[16]A. We did the one I think it was the last five
[17]years. We exhibited at the Orlando [*155]  -- the last time
[18]WSIA was there, I bought a booth space in Orlando at the
[19]Orlando Convention Center, and then I attended two more
[20]conventions. I didn't attend this -- this last year one
[21]-- the one they had -- they, typically, have it in
[22]November in Florida.
[23]Q. Did you ever exhibit outside of a convention
[24]when the convention was going on?
[25]A. What are you talking about?
163
[1]Q. I'm just asking you if you've ever exhibited
[2]outside in a parking lot of a convention when the
[3]convention was going on?
[4]MS. CHANG: Does this have any relevance to
[5]any issue in this lawsuit?
[6]A. I haven't exhibited. No. I've sat in a
[7]parking lot in my -- in my -- in my truck. Is that what
[8]you're asking me? Have I been in a parking lot? Yeah.
[9]MS. CHANG: And do we care? Seriously.
[10]THE WITNESS: Yeah. What's going on here?
[11]MS. CHANG: If you make me miss my hearing
[12]because of these questions I may attack you. No, I'm
[13]just teasing. I don't mean to say that but --
[14]MR. BIRENBACH: If -- if you attack me,
[15]I'll have more have questions. But Steven, I'm -- I
[16]think I'm done. I [*156]  just want to talk to my client so do
[17]you want to ask your questions or do you want to take a
[18]break for me to talk to my client? Steven?
[19]MS. CHANG: Steven?
[20]MR. BEFERA: Yeah. Sorry. How about a
[21]five-minute break? You can call your guy, and then I'll
[22]do my questions or you got more questions, you can
[23]finish up.
[24]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay. My guy is sitting
[25]right next to me, but we'll go talk out in the hall, and
164
[1]I may be done.
[2](Break taken at 3:12 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.)
[3]MR. BIRENBACH: It's your turn, Steven.
[4]MR. BEFERA: Do you have the exhibits handy
[5]there for the witness?
[6]MR. BIRENBACH: Yes.
[7]MS. CHANG: Yes.
[8]MR. BEFERA: Okay. Just let me know when
[9]you're ready.
[10]MS. CHANG: We're ready.
[11]EXAMINATION
[12]BY MR. BEFERA:
[13]Q. All right. Good afternoon, Ms. Clark. My name
[14]is Steven Befera. I represent Lucaya Resort. I've got
[15]some follow-up questions for you. Can you hear me all
[16]right?
[17]A. I certainly can. Thank you.
[18]Q. All right. In connection with your review of
[19]this case, have you reviewed the agreement between
[20] [*157]  Hutchison -- that's H-u-t-c-h-i-s-o-n -- Lucaya Limited
[21]and Ocean Motion Limited dated April 1, 2010?
[22]A. I read it a long time ago. Yes.
[23]Q. Okay. Are you going to be offering any type of
[24]a -- a observation regarding the resort's actions in
[25]connection with the accident causing the death of
165
[1]Crystal Rodriguez and the injury to Mr. Victor
[2]Rodriguez?
[3]A. Am I going to be offering any observations?
[4]Did -- is that what you asked me?
[5]Q. Yeah. In -- in connection with what the resort
[6]is alleged to have done or not done in connection with
[7]this incident.
[8]A. Well, after reading the agreement, I was
[9]concerned in that they had a duty to oversee the
[10]operations and failed to do so.
[11]Q. Okay. Well, this might take longer than 20
[12]minutes. Well, let me ask you this. What experience do
[13]you have in management of a -- resorts?
[14]A. I have none.
[15]Q. Okay. And do you hold yourself out as an
[16]expert in Bahamian law?
[17]A. I do not.
[18]Q. Okay.
[19]MS. CHANG: Okay. You know, Steve, I think
[20]your problem is you asked her do you have -- do you have
[21]any observations. [*158]  That's a very different question than
[22]are you going to be rendering any expert testimony on
[23]it. I mean, you asked her if she had observations. She
[24]gave it to you, but we -- I told you we're not offering
[25]her an as expert in hotel management in the Bahamas.
166
[1]MR. BEFERA: Okay. Well, my question was
[2]quite specific.
[3]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) I asked if you intended to
[4]testify regarding any observations -- okay -- at trial.
[5]That's what I mean. Do you intend to offer any kind of
[6]testimony, whether it's observations or opinions or
[7]whatever you want to call it, regarding the operation of
[8]the management of the hotel in connection with this
[9]incident?
[10]A. No.
[11]Q. I want you to take a look at Exhibit 2, which
[12]is the McCulloh report, page 18.
[13]MS. CHANG: Okay. She has it.
[14]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Now, if you look at the
[15]second picture there, that's the -- the twisted shackle
[16]that we're talking about, right?
[17]A. Okay. One moment. Let me get there. Yes, it
[18]is.
[19]Q. And is that the -- the top part of it, you --
[20]you're calling the carabin -- carabineer -- carabineer,
[21] [*159]  correct?
[22]A. Ye -- yes, sir.
[23]Q. And then the bottom part of it is the twisted
[24]shackle?
[25]A. That is correct.
167
[1]Q. Now, are those two items welded together in the
[2]manufacturing process?
[3]MS. CHANG: I hate to cause a -- a -- a
[4]little hiccup here. When you say top part, do you mean
[5]top part as you're looking at it or top part of the
[6]assembly as she would understand it?
[7]MR. BEFERA: Let me clarify.
[8]THE WITNESS: The right side, left side.
[9]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Is the carabineer welded to
[10]the twisted shackle in the manufacturing process?
[11]A. Yes.
[12]Q. And you indicated that's done by a specialist
[13]or should be done by a specialist who's familiar with
[14]welding stainless steel?
[15]A. Yes, sir.
[16]Q. Okay. If you look at the -- the bottom part or
[17]the connection part of the twisted shackle where it
[18]joins the tow bar, was it your understanding that this
[19]photograph and the McCulloh report at page 18 was taken
[20]after Mr. McCulloh had removed the twisted shackle from
[21]the tow bar?
[22]A. I'm not sure when that picture was taken and by
[23]whom. [*160] 
[24]Q. Okay. Do you know if -- when Mr. McCulloh
[25]first observed the tow bar that the twisted shackle was
168
[1]connected to it? I think you said yes.
[2]A. Well, in his deposition, he said that when he
[3]first went to the Bahamas on his own just to investigate
[4]the case that he called Detective Meronard, and Meronard
[5]came out and got him and showed him the equipment right
[6]away.
[7]Q. Right. And both of the twisted shackles were
[8]then connected to the tow bar?
[9]A. I -- I couldn't tell you. I would presume.
[10]Q. Okay. Well, if you look at the next page of
[11]this report --
[12]A. Uh-huh.
[13]Q. -- again, second photograph, it says the second
[14]pin could not be removed from the tow bar.
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. So can you deduce from that that he attempted
[17]to remove the se -- the second tow -- second pin?
[18]A. He probably tried with his fingers, and it --
[19]it was tight.
[20]Q. Oh, you're speculating. You don't know if had
[21]any kind of tools or anything. Why are you saying he
[22]used his fingers?
[23]A. Because that's what he told me. He said he
[24]tried to unscrew it with his [*161]  fingers. He couldn't do
[25]it.
169
[1]Q. Okay. The carabineer that is depicted in the
[2]next page, page 20, it's photo 47 --
[3]A. Yes, sir.
[4]Q. -- is that the same carabineer that's depicted
[5]in the second photograph on page 18?
[6]A. Yes, it is.
[7]Q. And that's the one that he's indicating is
[8]twisted and did not close properly because mis -- of
[9]misalignment?
[10]A. Correct.
[11]Q. Okay. Looking at Exhibit -- your Exhibit 1 to
[12]your deposition where you made some conclusions a --
[13]about the clip assembly was replaced before the tow bar
[14]was given to police, and you -- you made that deduction
[15]based upon the fact that there was a different date -- a
[16]manufacturing date on the carabineer clips that was
[17]related on the sales order that indicated the sale of
[18]the subject tow bar to Ocean Motion, correct?
[19]A. It's kind of a run-on sentence, but I -- but if
[20]you'll -- can you just synopsize it so I can --
[21]Q. I'm trying to be s -- I'm trying to, you know,
[22]make my questions as -- as concise as possible. I
[23]apologize.
[24]A. I'm -- I'm sorry.
[25]Q. As I understood your [*162]  earlier testimony, your
170
[1]opinion is that the clip assembly was replaced before
[2]the tow bar was given to police, correct?
[3]A. That's correct.
[4]Q. And that would require -- when you say clip
[5]assembly that would include the carabineer and the
[6]twisted shackle, correct?
[7]A. Yes, because it's one piece welded -- it's now
[8]one piece which has been welded together.
[9]Q. Okay. But just so our nomenclature is
[10]correct, when you say clip assembly, that's what you're
[11]talking about?
[12]A. Yes, sir.
[13]Q. And that would include that little screw
[14]connector which -- what -- what should we call that?
[15]A. That's the pin.
[16]Q. The pin. Okay. That would include the pin,
[17]correct?
[18]A. Yes, it would.
[19]Q. So you deduced that the clip assemblies on both
[20]sides of the tow bar were replaced before the tow bar
[21]was given to the police based upon the fact that the
[22]production or manufacture date stamped on the
[23]carabineers was indicative of a later date than the sale
[24]date of the tow bar by the seller to Ocean Motion,
[25]correct?
171
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. Now, this [*163]  photo 47 on page 20 of the report for
[3]Mr. McCulloh shows a carabineer that is defective. I
[4]mean, it's bent, right?
[5]A. Yes, that's what the -- the picture shows to
[6]me.
[7]Q. You wouldn't -- you wouldn't want -- if you
[8]were Ocean Motion, you wouldn't want to put somebody up
[9]in a parasail with -- with something that was not going
[10]to serve its useful purpose by -- by locking into place,
[11]correct?
[12]A. I, personally, wouldn't have used the bar,
[13]period, but I certainly wouldn't have used a -- a clip
[14]in this condition.
[15]Q. I'm wondering why, you know, you deduced that
[16]they would have -- have -- have put on this bar that
[17]they're presenting to the police a -- a clip that was
[18]bent?
[19]A. Well, that's easy to answer. These clips are
[20]expensive. They cost me about a hundred dollars. That
[21]Wichard twisted shackle's like sixty bucks and the other
[22]one's twenty something, and by the time you get them
[23]welded, they're a hundred dollars, and they're expensive
[24]and you -- as an operator, you're not going to have an
[25]inventory of those. You probably have a very limited
172
[1]amount because [*164]  of the number of bars. If you have two
[2]bars, you have four clips, and if you have replaced a --
[3]a clip for some reason, you might have one extra.
[4]They're just out of clips. They don't have any more
[5]clips.
[6]Q. But in order to -- because it's welded
[7]together, they would have had to replace the whole
[8]assembly?
[9]A. I think that they had that on hand. I think it
[10]was a bad one that they had damaged that they had
[11]replaced, and they didn't have any choice but to pull it
[12]out of its hibernated stage and attach it to the tow
[13]bar.
[14]Q. So they're going to have extra hundred dollar
[15]units like the assemblies like this sitting around --
[16]A. Well, I think --
[17]Q. -- that they can --
[18]A. I'm sorry.
[19]MS. CHANG: Go ahead.
[20]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) I wasn't finished with my
[21]question.
[22]MS. CHANG: Go ahead. We're waiting for
[23]you. Go ahead. Steven, go ahead. We're waiting.
[24]MR. BEFERA: I'm just waiting here. Am I
[25]-- am I clear to ask?
173
[1]MS. CHANG: You are totally clear.
[2]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Okay. Are -- is it your -- is
[3]it your testimony that they [*165]  have a number of these or
[4]had a number of these sitting around that they could use
[5]to replace at will as they needed to?
[6]A. No, I -- I think that they probably had damaged
[7]this one at some point and cast it aside because they
[8]didn't want to throw it away for whatever reason, and
[9]then when they had this emergency, they said oh, we got
[10]that extra clip. Let's just throw it on there. And
[11]it's all conjecture because I really don't know.
[12]Q. Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of guessing,
[13]wouldn't you say?
[14]A. Yes, it's guessing.
[15]Q. Okay. And also wouldn't it make more sense, if
[16]they had a couple of tow bars, that they might produce
[17]the other tow bar rather than go to all the trouble of
[18]-- of switching out pieces of the equipment?
[19]MS. CHANG: Yeah, that -- the question is
[20]nonsensical, difficult to understand, and impossible to
[21]answer and calls for speculation, but if you understood
[22]one portion of that -- yeah, I think if the court
[23]reporter read it back, you'd agree with me.
[24]MR. BEFERA: Well -- well, then let me
[25]re-ask -- let me re-ask the question.
174
[1]Q. (BY MR. [*166]  BEFERA) In your -- what do you call
[2]this report that you gave us here -- this multiple page
[3]little Power Point thing or whatever?
[4]MS. CHANG: She just calls it slides.
[5]MR. BEFERA: Slides. Okay.
[6]MS CHANG: We -- we call it --
[7]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) But in your slides which are
[8]marked as Exhibit 1 --
[9]MS. CHANG: -- we just call it Exhibit 1
[10]actually.
[11]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Okay. Well, in -- in
[12]Exhibit 1, there is a summary here of your opinions Re:
[13]Clip assembly on both sides, and you say the clip
[14]assembly was replaced before the tow bar was given to
[15]police. And isn't it as easily possible that maybe the
[16]whole tow bar was changed out?
[17]A. Well, I suppose anything's possible because
[18]there's a cover-up so we don't know to what extent the
[19]cover-up existed, but it seems logical to me they only
[20]had two tow bars, and they had to come up with one, and
[21]maybe they wanted to save the better one for their own
[22]use later on.
[23]Q. Now, you said that you read the deposition of
[24]the investigator, Sergeant Micholet Meronard, correct?
[25]A. Correct.
175
[1]Q. And attached [*167]  to his deposition was the Royal
[2]Bahamas police force report in this case. I'm assuming
[3]you saw that, too?
[4]A. I don't specifically recall it, but at some
[5]point I'm sure I read it.
[6]Q. And you said that you spoke with this
[7]policeman, Mr. Meronard, correct, Sergeant Meronard?
[8]A. Yes, I did.
[9]Q. And he had, you know, possession and custody
[10]and still does, for all we know, of this particular bar,
[11]right?
[12]A. That's true.
[13]Q. And in his report and this is Exhibit 53 to his
[14]deposition --
[15]MS. CHANG: We don't have that here with
[16]us.
[17]MR. BEFERA: Okay. Do you want me to
[18]e-mail it to you?
[19]MS. CHANG: No, I mean, I guess you'll just
[20]have to read it to us if you want to refer to anything
[21]because nobody here has that with them.
[22]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Well, do you -- let me -- let
[23]me ask you a couple of foundational questions then. Ms.
[24]-- Ms. Clark, do you have customers in the Bahamas?
[25]A. I do.
176
[1]Q. Okay. And one of them is -- is Sarah. I'm
[2]going to call her Sarah because she's got a couple of
[3]different last names we've been referring [*168]  to. If I say
[4]Sarah, do we all understand who we're talking about?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. Okay. Sarah's one of your customers. And how
[7]many other customers in the Bahamas do you have?
[8]A. Well, over 33 years, I've -- I've had many.
[9]Some are not active anymore.
[10]Q. But do you know if the Bahamas Port Department
[11]provides oversight to the parasailing industry in the
[12]Bahamas?
[13]A. I have no idea.
[14]Q. Do you know if they have annual inspections
[15]that are done of parasail operators like Ocean Motion?
[16]A. I have no idea.
[17]Q. Let me show you a -- another -- if you got
[18]Exhibit 2 there -- can you take a look at page 23,
[19]please?
[20]A. Exhibit 2. Is that McCulloh's? Okay. I'm
[21]sorry. Page 23?
[22]Q. Yes, ma'am.
[23]A. Okay. I'm with you.
[24]Q. Now, these are photographs of the parachute,
[25]right?
177
[1]A. Yes, sir, of a panel -- a portion of the
[2]parachute.
[3]Q. And you told us that Sarah mentioned to you
[4]that the parachute had nothing to do with the accident,
[5]and you were sure to want to document that because that
[6]had to deal with, you know, the [*169]  statement that was
[7]recorded -- the phone conversation, right?
[8]A. That's correct.
[9]Q. Now, in -- you know, Mr. McCulloh, obviously,
[10]for many years. He's making some observations here
[11]about some damage to the parasail and these rips are --
[12]are -- did these rips and holes that are depicted on
[13]page 23 of his report affect the operation of the chute
[14]at all?
[15]A. No, they're -- they're not proper, and they're
[16]certainly not anything we would have done, and they are
[17]repairs, and that -- they're so minor that they would
[18]not affect the operation of that chute. I'd fly in that
[19]chute tomorrow. There's nothing wrong with the chute.
[20]Q. Okay. So if -- if you have like minor tears
[21]like as depicted in the second photograph on page 23,
[22]even if Mr. McCulloh says the parasail canopy was torn
[23]and had multiple holes, some of which were improperly
[24]patched and others which were unrepaired, he's just
[25]making an observation, right, he's not saying it's not
178
[1]functional?
[2]A. Right. He's not saying it's not airworthy
[3]because I have, personally, had situations in the past
[4]where we flew a chute [*170]  with more holes than that, and
[5]they still fly. They're very -- they're very forgiving
[6]limp gliders, if you will, and they -- although it's not
[7]a good idea to fly a chute with holes because the
[8]material is ripstop so the ripstop does stop the spread
[9]of the hole.
[10]It should be returned to the factory for a
[11]proper repair, and this chute, I -- I would call it a --
[12]a -- a -- an ill repair, and it's certainly not any --
[13]it's not the proper way to do it. They did some
[14]homemade repairs because they didn't want to return it
[15]to me I guess through international means.
[16]Q. But just so we're clear. You, as an individual
[17]in this business, manufacturing chutes and in the
[18]business for over 35 years, your opinion is that the --
[19]the holes that are depicted on these photographs and
[20]discussed in Mr. McCulloh's report would not affect the
[21]airworthiness of this particular parasail?
[22]A. Absolutely agree with you. They're very minor,
[23]and they would not have anything to do with making the
[24]chute fly differently. The surface area of the chute is
[25]72 panels. This was a large chute. This hole is --
179
[1]although [*171]  we don't have a -- a -- a reference, I'm
[2]assuming from other visual references in this picture,
[3]the hole is six or eight inches and across. That's a
[4]very minor, minor deal in the scope of the square
[5]footage of the canopy.
[6]Q. Okay. Now, as far as the -- when someone gets
[7]into one of these harnesses, the flier gets into the
[8]harness, how is that harness attached to the parasail
[9]tow bar?
[10]A. That harness is -- is attached to the D-rings
[11]which are sewn into straps below the -- the D-bar or the
[12]tow bar.
[13]Q. And are the -- the harnesses connected with
[14]carabineers or some other type of a clip -- clip device?
[15]A. The harness has a -- a clip which, again, we --
[16]we -- we have two factories that we get different pieces
[17]from, and we have them welded. The spring clips come
[18]from Suncor Stainless, and the spring clips are sent to
[19]a -- another -- a marine manufacturer that manufactures
[20]the D-rings, and he actually builds that bottom piece
[21]and welds that together. The reason why is the clips
[22]need to face the same direction or be flat like the
[23]webbing so that when they're clipped into place [*172]  on the
[24]chute they're not twisted. They're not going the -- the
[25]opposite direction. They're not a -- a -- a -- a 90
180
[1]degree twist so tho --
[2]Q. Okay.
[3]A. -- those clips don't exist in the marketplace.
[4]That's why we have to have them manufactured.
[5]Q. Understood. You mentioned some questions or
[6]there -- there was a number of questions about how this
[7]twisted shackle is attached to the tow bar and the
[8]method by which it's attached. I have just a few
[9]follow-up on there. In -- in looking at the
[10]photographs, why couldn't somebody just put a -- a
[11]stainless steel bolt with a locknut through there rather
[12]than using this -- this pin?
[13]A. Well, you have to have a way to clip that bar
[14]into the chute. You see you have D-rings suspended from
[15]the tow bar that the passengers clip into, but then you
[16]have to clip the -- the tow bar into the chute because
[17]the chute has a D-ring in the riser. So you need a clip
[18]that's removable that -- because you don't use or Ocean
[19]Motion didn't use a tow bar on every flight. For single
[20]flights, they didn't use it.
[21]Q. Okay.
[22]A. So it's [*173]  got to be removable.
[23]Q. So you mean those -- those little -- those
[24]little screws, you got to take them out and put them
[25]back in?
181
[1]A. Absolutely not. The carabineer is a spring
[2]loaded clip, and a carabineer has that sleeve which you
[3]screw shut so it can't inadvertently pop open, but to
[4]remove that, you would just thumb screw that -- that --
[5]that little piece -- it's hard to explain because you're
[6]not here -- but there's a little piece which screws up
[7]and down on the -- on the -- on the carabineer itself to
[8]expose --
[9]Q. Yeah, I understand that.
[10]A. -- the clip.
[11]Q. I'm talking about the pin. In --
[12]A. Oh, the pin.
[13]Q. -- other words --
[14]A. There'd be no reason to take that off the --
[15]the bar in normal course of operation.
[16]Q. Yeah, exactly. That's what I was saying. So
[17]why not just -- just, you know, put a -- a stainless
[18]steel bolt through there with a locknut --
[19]A. Well, you can't --
[20]Q. -- to keep it from coming out?
[21]A. Because you need some way to clip that bar into
[22]the chute.
[23]Q. Into the chute. I'm not -- I'm [*174]  not
[24]understanding the -- the --
[25]A. Well, the -- the -- again, we have to have --
182
[1]as I mentioned, on the body harness, the clips have to
[2]be facing forwards and backwards. You can't have a clip
[3]facing right and left to the outside. It's got to be
[4]facing forward and backwards to clip into the chute --
[5]Q. Yeah. Well, that's --
[6]A. -- and --
[7]Q. -- fine. That's not what I'm talking about.
[8]If you look at -- if -- if you look at page 18 again.
[9]A. Okay.
[10]Q. Okay. And -- and -- and you -- you've --
[11]you've told us that one of the things that has advanced
[12]over the years is the use of a -- a bushing in the hole
[13]where the pin goes through the bar, right?
[14]A. Actually, may --
[15]MS. CHANG: I -- I -- no, that --
[16]A. -- I -- may I stop you? That's not correct.
[17]MS. CHANG: That is totally --
[18]A. That's not correct.
[19]MS. CHANG: -- totally, totally misstates
[20]her testimony, and I will object to that.
[21]MR. BEFERA: Okay. Sorry.
[22]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Where's the bushing then?
[23]A. The bushing is in the bar itself. If you want
[24]to look [*175]  at -- at page 18, the top piece, it's -- Mark's
[25]referring to it as the pilot hole.
183
[1]Q. Yeah.
[2]A. That's where the bushing goes so that when you
[3]put the pin through that pilot hole it fits snuggly.
[4]Q. All right. That's what I'm saying. That's
[5]exactly what I just said. That's where the bushing
[6]goes --
[7]MS. CHANG: No, no.
[8]A. No.
[9]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) -- in that hole.
[10]MS. CHANG: No, no, no. And you also --
[11]what -- what we objected to is you acted like it was
[12]like new development, and she didn't say that. So it
[13]doesn't matter. Just ask your question without the
[14]preface and then we'll be fine.
[15]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) You told us that there were
[16]certain improvements in design over the years one of
[17]which was using a bushing --
[18]A. No.
[19]MS. CHANG: No --
[20]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) -- correct?
[21]MS. CHANG: No, no.
[22]A. No, I did not.
[23]MS. CHANG: That's what she -- she didn't
[24]say that that was de -- it was always with the bushing.
[25]MR. BEFERA: Okay. All right. Maybe I
184
[1]misheard it.
[2]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) In any event, [*176]  I'm talking
[3]about that hole. Okay. And when you have the twisted
[4]shackle, if that goes over the -- over the hole, and
[5]then you put your pin through there, correct?
[6]A. That's correct.
[7]Q. My question is in -- in order to keep thing --
[8]keep the pin from backing out due to vibrations or
[9]wallowing, why couldn't you just put a -- a stainless
[10]steel -- a bolt with a -- with a locknut on the other
[11]side through that hole?
[12]A. Well, Wichard makes this twisted shackle, No.
[13]1, it's marine hardware. It's made for the marine
[14]environment which some manufacturers hold a higher
[15]standard of manufacturing than 3 16 metal, stainless
[16]steel or whatever. Plus, it -- it has to be attached to
[17]the top clip so that they don't move, and it needs to be
[18]welded, and it has to have separation. It has to be
[19]high enough.
[20]This is -- there -- there may be other
[21]pieces of hardware out on the market which would work,
[22]but this particular piece of hardware works well with us
[23]because the bar here is not padded, but my bars are
[24]padded, and you have to have a -- a certain clearance to
[25]get around the padding. [*177]  You don't want a lot of
185
[1]movement in that -- in that hardware.
[2]MS. CHANG: Plus, don't they have to be
[3]usable in the field and how you're going to undo --
[4]A. Yeah, they had -- they had to be user friendly.
[5]Q. (BY MR. BEFERA) Okay.
[6]A. I mean, once -- once this --
[7]Q. Sorry. I can't hear. Whoever's talking in the
[8]background, I couldn't hear you.
[9]A. Well, what we're saying here is it has to be
[10]user friendly. The guys that --
[11]Q. No, I unders -- I -- you know, I -- I do -- you
[12]know, we can talk off the record later about this. It's
[13]just a -- some kind of an academic point. That's fine.
[14]A. Okay.
[15]Q. Do you -- now, you are working for plaintiffs'
[16]counsel in the case?
[17]A. That's correct.
[18]Q. They hired you, right?
[19]A. They hired me. Yes.
[20]Q. Okay. Is there any kind of a written agreement
[21]between you and them?
[22]A. I don't believe so. No.
[23]Q. Is there any agreement, either written or
[24]verbal, that you will not be made a defendant in these
[25]-- in this lawsuit or any other lawsuit as a result of
186
[1]the death of -- [*178]  of Crystal and the injury to Victor?
[2]A. No.
[3]Q. Okay. Have you spoken with any representatives
[4]of Hutchison Lucaya or Lucaya Resort in connection with
[5]this incident?
[6]A. No, sir.
[7]Q. Have you ever stayed at the Hutchison Lucaya
[8]Resort?
[9]A. No, I have not.
[10]Q. Have you spoken with Ricky Rolle -- is it Rolle
[11]or Rolle? How do you --
[12]A. Rolle.
[13]Q. -- pronounce that?
[14]A. Rolle.
[15]Q. Rolle. Okay. Have you spoken with Ricky Rolle
[16]as a -- in -- and in connection with this incident?
[17]A. No, I have not.
[18]Q. Just Sarah?
[19]A. That's correct. But I never --
[20]Q. All right.
[21]A. -- as a matter of business, I -- I usually
[22]wouldn't speak to Ricky. I always spoke to Sarah.
[23]Q. Okay. And why was that?
[24]A. Well, she was just the go-between, and we knew
[25]each other because I had met her. Ricky and --
187
[1]Q. Okay.
[2]A. -- her got married later on.
[3]Q. All right. And with regard to your
[4]investigation, did you speak with any representatives --
[5]and by that I mean, employees or agents who may have
[6] [*179]  worked for Ocean Motion at any time --
[7]A. No.
[8]Q. -- in connection with this accident?
[9]A. I'm sorry. No.
[10]Q. Was there any reason why you didn't record that
[11]first conversation you had with Sarah when she called
[12]the very first day?
[13]A. Yes, I had no idea she was calling. I didn't
[14]know about the accident, and I was at my house where I
[15]didn't have access to my recording devices.
[16]Q. Now, if -- if -- I'm getting back to Sergeant
[17]Meronard's report. He calls the tow bar silver titanium
[18]steel bar with gray duct tape. That's not right, is it?
[19]A. No, it's not titanium. It's aluminum.
[20]Q. And, as far as you know, the rope and all the
[21]harnesses were workable in this particular incident?
[22]A. That's correct. They were a -- a little
[23]shabby, but I -- I wouldn't be flying with that rope.
[24]That rope looked like it was way too old to me but --
[25]but that's not a rope they would have purchased from --
188
[1]from me. They probably got that there in the Bahamas
[2]anyway, but the harn -- but there was no issue with the
[3]harnesses. And, again, they were a little shabby but
[4]functional. [*180] 
[5]Q. All right. And with regard to the way the ac
[6]-- accident happened, you told us that Sarah said that
[7]the -- that the tow bar became detached from the chute,
[8]correct?
[9]A. Yes, sir.
[10]Q. Now, as I understand it, if that were to
[11]happen, the chute would still be connected to the boat,
[12]right?
[13]A. That's correct.
[14]Q. So the chute wouldn't fly off. It would still
[15]have a separate connection to the boat, and just the tow
[16]bar and the fliers would -- would -- would -- would
[17]fall, right?
[18]A. Yes, they would separate because that's the
[19]pendulum weight to the chute.
[20]Q. And what would happen to the chute at that
[21]point? What would -- what would the chute look like at
[22]that point once that occurred?
[23]A. It would collapse because it had no -- no
[24]pendulum weight. There's three things that take that we
[25]need to make the chute fly. You need relative wind.
189
[1]You need attitude of the canopy, and you need pendulum
[2]weight. We had relative wind because the boat was under
[3]propulsion creating a wind or we had the natural wind of
[4]the environment. We had attitude of the [*181]  canopy which is
[5]-- it's fully developed, and it's trimmed for glided
[6]flight, and we had the pendulum weight.
[7]Now, if you remove any one of these three,
[8]the canopy will not fly, and we removed the pendulum
[9]weight, which means that the canopy is not going to fly
[10]on its own. It -- it would absolutely flutter down, as
[11]in the video, or it would just crash to the ground.
[12]Q. Would that also be true if just one side of the
[13]tow bar became detached from the chute?
[14]A. Yes, and the -- the rotation would be what we
[15]call a vicious rotation. It would be sudden. It would
[16]-- actually, in the industry, a lot of people would
[17]refer to it as a line over. Basically, the flier would
[18]pass above the tow line and crash with the chute
[19]upsidedown into the water.
[20]Q. Okay. Let me check my notes. I think I'm
[21]done.
[22]MR. BEFERA: Okay. That's all I have.
[23]Thank you, ma'am.
[24]THE WITNESS: You're welcome.
[25]FURTHER EXAMINATION
190
[1]BY MR. BIRENBACH:
[2]Q. Just a few follow-up questions, Ms. Clark.
[3]Have you ever seen the parasail in police custody in the
[4]Bahamas in person?
[5] [*182]  A. I have not.
[6]Q. Have you ever seen that parasail inflated in
[7]person?
[8]A. Not in person, no, just in --
[9]Q. Have --
[10]A. -- photographs.
[11]Q. -- have you ever seen that parasail in flight
[12]in person?
[13]A. You mean, the actual motion of it inflating
[14]or --
[15]Q. No, in flight. In use.
[16]A. Oh, in flight. Yes.
[17]Q. That parachute?
[18]A. Yes.
[19]Q. Well, when did you see that?
[20]A. Well, when the -- there was a young man on the
[21]platform that flew immediately before the Rodriguezes,
[22]and the young man flew by himself without the doub --
[23]the -- the doubles bar, and there is a picture of him
[24]taken by his father, as he was coming in for a landing,
[25]and you can clearly see that it's the same parachute
191
[1]immediately before the Rodriguezes boarded it because
[2]you can see -- the reason why I know that is you can see
[3]the little area they repaired on the right-hand side.
[4]As you look at the canopy inflated coming towards you,
[5]it would be about 4:00 o'clock. So we knew the chute
[6]was fine the flight before.
[7]Q. That was a still photograph, correct? [*183] 
[8]A. Yes, it was.
[9]Q. Just as a housekeeping matter. At some point
[10]in time, you received a subpoena that was served on you;
[11]is that right?
[12]A. That's correct.
[13]Q. And that was signed by me? Well --
[14]A. Was it?
[15]Q. Okay.
[16]A. I don't know.
[17]Q. Well, in any --
[18]A. It was. Okay.
[19]Q. -- in any -- any event, did you bring the
[20]documents that you were asked to bring?
[21]A. I -- I don't think it asked me to bring any
[22]documents. I think it just said appear. I didn't see
[23]any request for documents unless I missed something.
[24]I'm sorry.
[25]Q. So you didn't make a search for the documents
192
[1]that were requested in the subpoena?
[2]A. What did you request?
[3]Q. Well, the -- I --
[4]A. I didn't -- I don't know. I'm sorry. And I --
[5]and I received a subpoena, but I didn't receive one for
[6]today. I just had a notice of appearance.
[7](Exhibit No. 5 was marked.)
[8]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) I'm going to hand you
[9]what's been marked as Exhibit 5. Is this a --
[10]A. Okay.
[11]Q. -- copy of a recei -- the subpoena that you
[12]received? [*184] 
[13]A. Yeah, this is the copy of the subpoena that I
[14]got for a meeting that didn't occur.
[15]Q. And just for the record by --
[16]A. Uh-huh.
[17]Q. -- agreement with Patrick Montoya, I was told I
[18]didn't need to re-serve the subpoena.
[19]MS. CHANG: Oh, okay. I -- I -- I will
[20]tell you that I never saw this either so --
[21]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay. It was served. Yes.
[22]MS. CHANG: And what -- what did you want?
[23]MR. BIRENBACH: I just wanted to know if
[24]she brought the documents that were --
[25]MS. CHANG: What documents are you looking
193
[1]for?
[2]THE WITNESS: What does it say?
[3]MS. CHANG: Oh, it says paper copies of
[4]your complete file concerning plaintiff and all records
[5]of sales. We do have that. Do you want it?
[6]MR. BIRENBACH: Sure.
[7]MS. CHANG: Okay. So you brought your
[8]files here, right, and then --
[9]THE WITNESS: Well, these are just the
[10]depositions. There's nothing in there. There's no
[11]personal notes or anything.
[12]MS. CHANG: I can do this. Why don't I get
[13]from Patrick a chart of everything that was sent to her?
[14]That's what we usually [*185]  do in California, and then what I
[15]know I have on here in my drop box all the invoices that
[16]she had of any sales to Ocean Motion so I can give it to
[17]her to look at, and then if that's good, I'll burn it on
[18]your little flash drive.
[19]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[20]MS. CHANG: Is that good with you?
[21]MR. BIRENBACH: Yes.
[22]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[23]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) And just some follow-up
[24]questions on that. At some point in time, you provided
[25]Debbie with -- or other members of the Rodriguez legal
194
[1]team -- copies of invoices between Sport Chutes and
[2]Ocean Motion?
[3]A. Right. That's what she's referring to.
[4]Q. And when did you do that?
[5]A. I --
[6]MS. CHANG: I think there was an affidavit
[7]she filed regarding jurisdiction in this case, and it
[8]showed shipments that were to Fort Lauderdale. Do
[9]you --
[10]THE WITNESS: Right.
[11]MS. CHANG: -- remember that?
[12]THE WITNESS: Yeah.
[13]MS. CHANG: And I think that's --
[14]THE WITNESS: That's when we did that --
[15]MS. CHANG: -- that's the memory that I
[16]have.
[17]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) Who -- who [*186]  made the search
[18]for those records?
[19]A. I personally did.
[20]Q. How did you go about searching for those
[21]records?
[22]A. It's in my computer.
[23]Q. Do you have like a customer code so you could
[24]search by customer?
[25]A. Yeah, by name. I just put in Ocean Motion, and
195
[1]it comes up with the customer history --
[2]Q. And you turned -- you turned over --
[3]A. -- and the date.
[4]Q. -- all of the records involving Ocean Motion
[5]to --
[6]A. Yes, I did.
[7]Q. Let me finish the question. Okay?
[8]A. I'm sorry.
[9]Q. We're -- it's getting late. I understand.
[10]A. I'm sorry.
[11]Q. You turned over all of those records to
[12]Ms. Chang or other members of the Rodriguez legal team?
[13]A. I turned them over to Ms. Chang.
[14]MS. CHANG: Would you like me just to drop
[15]box you a little link to this?
[16]MR. BIRENBACH: Sure. Whatever's easiest.
[17]MS. CHANG: It's -- it's called Ocean
[18]Motion invoices, and these are what I have. Let me just
[19]show them -- there's one of eight.
[20]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[21]MS. CHANG: And this one is --
[22]THE [*187]  WITNESS: Can we bring -- you make it a
[23]little bigger?
[24]MS. CHANG: Make it a little bigger. Now,
[25]you're testing me here. I don't think I can.
196
[1]THE WITNESS: Okay. Well, then maybe move
[2]it closer.
[3]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[4]THE WITNESS: Maybe give me a magnifying
[5]glass.
[6]MS. CHANG: So here's this.
[7]THE WITNESS: Is it -- is that the first
[8]one?
[9]MS. CHANG: Well, the first one's here.
[10]THE WITNESS: Okay. And that was dated?
[11]MS. CHANG: It's -- the date's right here.
[12]THE WITNESS: Okay. 12 something.
[13]MS. CHANG: 2007. It looks like that's
[14]2008, '09. Harnesses. Okay?
[15]THE WITNESS: Yeah, go back to --
[16]MR. BIRENBACH: Can I just finish my
[17]questioning and --
[18]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[19]MR. BIRENBACH: -- we'll deal with the --
[20]MS. CHANG: Oh, wait. Hold it. I can blow
[21]it up. I'm sorry. So that's blown up a little more.
[22]The last one looks like it's 5/4/2011. 12 inch -- a
[23]harness.
[24]THE WITNESS: Let me see. Yeah.
[25]MS. CHANG: Okay. I'll just invite him to
197
[1]a link to this.
[2]THE WITNESS: Okay.
[3] [*188]  MS. CHANG: Is that good with you?
[4]MR. BIRENBACH: That's fine.
[5]MS. CHANG: Okay. Can I get your e-mail,
[6]too?
[7]MR. BIRENBACH: Brian@rietzlawfirm.com. 7     MR. BIRENBACH: Brian@rietzlawfirm.com.
[8]MS. CHANG: Okay. Give me one second. I'm
[9]sorry. I'm not that fast.
[10]MR. BIRENBACH: Let just finish up my --
[11]MS. CHANG: Well, can I -- I'm right here.
[12]I -- I -- I will -- you know I'll be running. Go ahead.
[13]MR. BIRENBACH: Brian -- B-r-i-a-n --
[14]MS. CHANG: -- a-n@rietzlawfirm.com. And,14     MS. CHANG: -- a-n@rietzlawfirm.com. And,
[15]Steve, I'm going to send you one, too. But, Guys, I'm
[16]sending me a copy, too. If it's anything that's work
[17]product because I'm -- I can't tell what I'm sending,
[18]please don't open it. Okay? Let me see. I should
[19]cancel it. Let me see if I can just -- go ahead and do
[20]whatever you want to do. I'll -- I'm trying to get this
[21]for you in some way.
[22]Q. (BY MR. BIRENBACH) If a clip came off of the
[23]bar on one side, all the weight would shi -- shift to
[24]the other side; is that right?
[25]A. That's absolutely correct.
198
[1]Q. And that would cause the parasail to crash into
[2]the water with the parasailers, correct?
[3] [*189]  A. Correct.
[4]MS. CHANG: Can you give me that sheet
[5]again?
[6]MR. BIRENBACH: That's all I have.
[7]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[8]MR. BIRENBACH: Anything else, Steven?
[9]MS. CHANG: Okay, Guys. I just sent you
[10]the invoices, and I will get you a table of everything
[11]we sent to her. I can tell you it's pretty much every
[12]depo and exhibit and report generated.
[13]MR. BIRENBACH: Okay.
[14]MS. CHANG: Okay.
[15]MR. BIRENBACH: All set, Steven?
[16]MS. CHANG: He's on -- he's on mute right
[17]now. Steven, we love you. Bye.
[18]MR. BEFERA: Hey -- -hey, wait a minute.
[19]Off the record. Are we off the record?
[20]MS. CHANG: Yes.
