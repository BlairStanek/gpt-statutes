[1]A Well, that is just the mail box office for the
[2]business called EliteRAD, EliteRAD Radiology Services,
[3]which is a national radiology practice. We practice in
[4]28 states across the United States.
[5]Q And EliteRAD Radiology Services is your
[6]company?
[7]A Yes, ma'am.
[8]Q How long has that been in existence?
[9]A Well, the company has been in existence since
[10]2004, although it's existed in different corporate
[11]names. I think that name has been used since 2006.
[12]Q You are a radiologist, correct?
[13]A Yes, ma'am.
[14]Q Are you a neuroradiologist?
[15]A I don't say that I'm a neuroradiologist. I
[16]just say I'm a radiologist. I did my fellowship in MRI
[17]and musculoskeletal radiology, although I do say that I
[18]specialize in neuroradiology in that I am a member of
[19]the American Society of Neuroradiology, and I meet the
[20]qualifications for membership.
[21]Q Do you pretty much limit your reading and
[22]interpretation of imaging through EliteRAD Radiology
[23]Services to imaging of the brain and spine?
[24]A No, ma'am. I read everything. In fact, just
[25]prior to this deposition I read a chest x-ray.
[1]Q Is all of your professional time related to
[2]the rendering or the interpretation for radiology
[3]imaging done through EliteRAD Radiology Services?
[4]A Well, all of the radiology I do goes through
[5]EliteRAD Radiology Services unless -- yes, I would
[6]believe that that is correct. The only -- there is
[7]another radiology practice that we have called
[8]Allegiance Radiology, LLC, which I am the sole owner of.
[9]It's a Georgia corporation, and we started that Georgia
[10]corporation to function under various other state laws
[11]and certain states.
[12]So in some states -- there is a few states
[13]that we practice under Allegiance, but most states we
[14]practice under EliteRAD, however, all of the money goes
[15]through EliteRAD, so it's almost like a d/b/a.
[16]Q So in 2016, June, what percentage of your
[17]professional income was derived from imaging that was
[18]originally performed at SimonMed and read by EliteRAD?
[19]A I don't know that answer. I would not have
[20]any way of being able to estimate even. However,
[21]SimonMed was our largest client at that time.
[22]Q How many radiologists other than yourself read
[23]through EliteRAD?
[24]A We have ten full-time radiologists, and we
[25]have some part-time radiologists.
[1]Q Was that the same in 2016?
[2]A We had one other radiologist who is retired,
[3]however we had fewer -- there are several radiologists
[4]who joined since 2016, so it was probably six or seven
[5]radiologists full-time at that time.
[6]Q Was there anyone at EliteRAD in August 2000 --
[7]strike that.
[8]Was there anyone at EliteRAD in June 2016 who
[9]was specializing in breast imaging?
[10]A We had a doctor named Dr. Victor Gregory, M.D.
[11]who read mammograms.
[12]Q Did he read any other breast imaging in
[13]June 2016 for EliteRAD other than mammography?
[14]A I don't know that answer, but I don't believe
[15]he would have.
[16]Q And is Dr. Gregory licensed in Florida?
[17]A Yes, ma'am.
[18]Q Although you said that SimonMed was your
[19]largest client in 2016, has that changed?
[20]A Yes. They are not my -- they may still be our
[21]largest client, but I don't think that they are. We
[22]have several other clients, and our business from
[23]SimonMed has decreased significantly really just in the
[24]last few months.
[25]Q You apparently have some professional
[1]relationship and personal relationship with Myriam
[2]Wilson's son Jerrod Wilson; is that right?
[3]A I would say Mr. Wilson is a referring
[4]physician. I never knew him in any capacity other than
[5]referring physician that I may have spoken to once or
[6]twice, but he -- one of my employees got married. I
[7]went to the wedding, and I saw Mr. Wilson at the
[8]wedding, Dr. Wilson at the wedding. And we spoke at
[9]that time, and we became acquaintances, I would say. I
[10]would not necessarily say we are friends, but certainly
[11]if we see each other at a social gathering, we certainly
[12]have pleasantries with one another.
[13]Q So you know that Dr. Jerrod Wilson is a
[14]chiropractor with Mauricio Chiropractic, right?
[15]A Yes, ma'am, I did know that.
[16]Q And you know that Dr. Wilson has sent imaging
[17]from his practice at Mauricio Chiropractic to EliteRAD
[18]to be read, correct?
[19]A Yes, ma'am.
[20]Q That was true before June 2016, correct?
[21]A Yes. I do know that the majority of his work
[22]goes to another center, which he has told me that his
[23]practice as a preference is sending to another center,
[24]which I told him that is fine. I certainly don't hold
[25]it against somebody because they don't work with me.
[1]Q Well, in 2016 would you dispute that you were
[2]doing an extensive amount of radiology interpretation
[3]for Mauricio Chiropractic providers?
[4]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, vague,
[5]ambiguous and lack of predicate.
[6]A I don't know that answer. I do know that I
[7]read for Dr. Wilson, and I do that we did some work with
[8]Mauricio Chiropractic, that company, but I do know that
[9]the Mauricio Chiropractic practice sent -- at least I
[10]was told; I don't know this -- but I was told that the
[11]majority of their work went to the other facility that I
[12]used to work with called Stand-up Orlando, Stand-up MRI
[13]of Orlando.
[14]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[15]Q And when were you told that most of the
[16]Mauricio imaging interpretation was going to Stand-up
[17]MRI rather than coming to you or EliteRAD?
[18]A I was told that during various business
[19]meetings in which of course I'm trying to direct my
[20]marketing staffs to try to get doctors to send their
[21]work to my practice, which means I'm trying to get them
[22]to send them to facilities that I work with. So at that
[23]time I would have been trying to get them to send to
[24]SimonMed because SimonMed was the company that I worked
[25]with here in the Central Florida region.
[1]Q So when you were reading or EliteRAD was
[2]reading imaging from Mauricio Chiropractic, did you have
[3]a written agreement with the individual chiropractors or
[4]did you have a written agreement with Mauricio
[5]Chiropractic?
[6]A No. I would never have a written agreement
[7]with a referring physician. I would ask them to send me
[8]their business because I want to work with them, but I
[9]think having a written agreement regarding that -- I
[10]mean, I'm not going to say it was inappropriate, but I
[11]didn't have any such relationship.
[12]Q Before June 2016 you attended marketing
[13]functions where Dr. Wilson was in attendance, and they
[14]were functions sponsored by EliteRAD, right?
[15]A I don't recall that, but that probably did
[16]happen. There were many marketing functions. Some of
[17]them I would attend and some I wouldn't, and there would
[18]be many people there. Sometimes there would be, you
[19]know -- I certainly would not be able to say hi to
[20]everyone there. There would be that many people there.
[21]Q And what would be the nature of the marketing
[22]functions that EliteRAD would be a sponsor of where
[23]somebody like Jerrod Wilson and Mauricio Chiropractic
[24]would be attending and you would be trying to encourage
[25]him or Mauricio Chiropractic to send the imaging to
[1]EliteRAD?
[2]A Well, SimonMed would have various marketing
[3]functions that I would attend, and I would have my
[4]EliteRAD staff attend, and we may have co-sponsored them
[5]with SimonMed. I don't know that EliteRAD actually
[6]sponsored any marketing events on their own, but they
[7]may have sponsored events in conjunction with another
[8]company. It's also possible we may have, and I just
[9]don't know because I don't know everything that our
[10]marketing staff does.
[11]Q Did you co-sponsor marketing events where you
[12]invited chiropractors and other healthcare providers
[13]where the co-sponsor was some imaging business other
[14]than SimonMed before 2016?
[15]A Well, I would not say we co-sponsored them
[16]prior to 2016. I don't know that we had started
[17]sponsoring events until after my relationship with
[18]SimonMed. In other words, it was SimonMed that
[19]suggested this relationship to me. I'm -- I -- prior to
[20]that time imaging centers might have a marketing event,
[21]and then I would show up to the marketing event.
[22]Q So what year was it that you developed any
[23]relationship with SimonMed, EliteRAD and SimonMed for
[24]purposes of reading imaging or having any marketing
[25]activities be somehow connected to SimonMed --
[1]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, compound.
[2]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[3]Q -- versus EliteRAD?
[4]MS. HENRY: Same objection.
[5]A I would not even know. In other words, I'm
[6]saying things exist but I'm not even sure that I know
[7]for a fact exist because I just don't have a
[8]recollection of these events.
[9]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[10]Q Well, you said that you developed a
[11]relationship with SimonMed, and SimonMed suggested this
[12]co-sponsorship. What year was that?
[13]A I would think that those -- that started
[14]happening -- I'm going to guess this -- it may have been
[15]2015. I don't remember when I first started working
[16]with SimonMed. I'm thinking it was 2014 or 2015. I
[17]think I started working with SimonMed in November 2014,
[18]to my recollection. I may have the year incorrect, but
[19]I started working with them as the only doctor in
[20]EliteRAD that worked with SimonMed.
[21]And then in February of 2015 I started to --
[22]the relationship had blossomed to a point that we had
[23]brought in several of other doctors into working with
[24]SimonMed, but only here in Florida.
[25]And then it was during that period of time I
[1]would have been working with a gentleman named Grant
[2]Nelson, who was the head of the SimonMed facilities in
[3]Florida, at least that was my knowledge. And he had
[4]sponsored most of the events, and then I believe there
[5]was one or two events that occurred in which there was a
[6]co-sponsorship type of deal that occurred. But I don't
[7]know what those events were. I don't even know if those
[8]events were for chiropractors, which is what we
[9]originally said, although Dr. Wilson may have been in
[10]attendance.
[11]Q Before June 2016 you had interacted with
[12]Dr. Jerrod Wilson at Mauricio Chiropractic on multiple
[13]occasions, not just at marketing events, but in other
[14]professional contexts, right?
[15]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, vague,
[16]ambiguous, lack of predicate.
[17]A I really don't know that answer. In fact, the
[18]only way I would have dealt with Dr. Wilson prior to the
[19]wedding that I mentioned earlier in which I saw him,
[20]would have been in a professional capacity in which he
[21]was a chiropractor and I was a radiologist.
[22]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[23]Q Do you recall having dinner with him before
[24]June 2016?
[25]A No, I don't recall, but I don't know that that
[1]did not happen. It's possible that I may have. I did a
[2]lot of dinners.
[3]Q Do you recall having drinks with Dr. Wilson
[4]before June 2013 or strike that -- '16?
[5]A I don't recall, but that may have happened
[6]certainly. Oh, wait. Before May of 2016?
[7]Q No, June 2016.
[8]A Well, that would have -- I would have -- I
[9]certainly would have had drinks with Dr. Wilson because
[10]we had drinks at the wedding that I mentioned, and I
[11]know that I've met Dr. Wilson on at least one other
[12]occasion. I didn't meet him, but we were both at an
[13]event together, so I may have had dinner with him, and I
[14]may have had drinks with him certainly.
[15]Q Can you tell me approximately how many
[16]occasions before June 2016 when he asked you to read or
[17]review his mother's breast imaging you had talked with
[18]him in any capacity, socially or professionally?
[19]A I can't tell you that answer, but it's
[20]probably less than ten.
[21]Q Would you have an understanding from your
[22]contact with Mauricio Chiropractic providers that
[23]EliteRAD was in the top three imaging companies or
[24]imaging contractors that Mauricio Chiropractic was using
[25]as of 2016?
[1]A It wouldn't surprise me we would be in the top
[2]three. I know they mostly used one or two, so certainly
[3]we could be number three and be the last of them.
[4]Q So if you were in the top three, you being
[5]either you, Dr. Mahan, or being EliteRAD for the
[6]interpretation of Dr. Wilson's patients' imaging before
[7]June 2016, it's your testimony you spoke with him less
[8]than ten times?
[9]A That's to my recollection. I mean, I didn't
[10]speak with Dr. Wilson on very many occasions. I don't
[11]speak with most of my referring physicians. In fact,
[12]most of the referring physicians I work with I may have
[13]never met or spoken to or maybe just spoken to them
[14]once. And I read about 20,000 exams per year, so that
[15]would not be unusual.
[16]I may have met Dr. Wilson prior to that. I
[17]know that I met Dr. Wilson prior to that wedding because
[18]I recognized him, and I knew he was a referring
[19]physician. When I saw him at the wedding, he was the
[20]only doctor at the wedding, so I certainly felt like I
[21]was expected to know who he was, so I got -- so I
[22]remembered his name, and I got to know him.
[23]And it was during that wedding that I really
[24]found out that I liked Dr. Wilson. I liked him as a
[25]person, and we really -- I enjoyed his company, and it
[1]was after that period of time that I would say that I
[2]developed a friendship with him, and that was probably
[3]2015.
[4]Q Whose wedding was it?
[5]A I have an employee. Her name is Yamira
[6]Rodriguez, and she was the one who got married.
[7]Q What was Dr. Wilson's connection with your
[8]employee?
[9]A I know they are friends.
[10]Q So in June 2016 you considered Jerrod Wilson
[11]to be a referring physician to EliteRAD, correct?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q In June 2016 you considered Mauricio
[14]Chiropractic to be a referring practice or provider to
[15]EliteRAD, correct?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q How long had you been reading Mauricio
[18]Chiropractic imaging as of 2016?
[19]A I don't know that answer, but it probably was
[20]several years, in other words, more than five or six
[21]years.
[22]Q You've been a radiologist since when?
[23]A I graduated from medical school in 1991. I
[24]finished -- I passed my boards in '95, and I finished my
[25]fellowship at Georgetown University Medical Center in
[1]1996, so I would be considered a radiologist after any
[2]of those dates.
[3]Q You are not a breast imager or rather a breast
[4]imaging radiologist, are you?
[5]A I am, actually. I'm not only board-certified
[6]as a breast radiologist. I'm not only board-certified
[7]to read breast imaging, but I was MQSA certified three
[8]times in my life, and I used to own a mammography center
[9]in Winter Park, Florida. It was called Mammography
[10]Center of Winter Park, and that was located on Aloma
[11]Avenue, and I was the sole radiologist for that center
[12]while it was open.
[13]So however, currently I am not MQSA certified.
[14]I let my MQSA certification pass, so I would have to say
[15]that currently right now I do not read mammography,
[16]although I can read breast MRI.
[17]Q When were you last MQSA certified?
[18]A I don't know that date. I haven't read
[19]mammography in many years. I would say probably 2013
[20]maybe is the last time I read mammography.
[21]Q Why did you decide to let the MQSA
[22]certification lapse?
[23]A I just wasn't reading mammography anymore. It
[24]may have been as late as 2015 actually now that I'm
[25]thinking about it because the MQSA certification lasts
[1]for a period of time after. I would have not been
[2]reading mammography, although I would not have
[3]maintained the maintenance that is required. In other
[4]words, the number of cases per month you have to read,
[5]so it probably was about 2013, 2014.
[6]Q When did the Mammography Center of Winter Park
[7]cease doing business?
[8]A I stopped -- I closed down -- I started the
[9]center because there was a crisis here in Florida
[10]because radiologists were not reading mammography, and
[11]women had as long as a six-month wait to get a mammogram
[12]at the centers that existed. So I started that center
[13]to help relieve the crisis. I was in a meeting, which
[14]there were members of the state government there
[15]discussing this crisis, and I thought I could do
[16]something to help out by opening up a center.
[17]When this got relieved, which was about a year
[18]after I opened it up, I didn't particularly enjoy doing
[19]mammography, so I decided once the crisis was over I
[20]didn't need to have the center anymore, so I closed it
[21]down.
[22]Q I think the question though was when did you
[23]close?
[24]A I think it was about a year after I opened it.
[25]Q What year was that?
[1]A I can't remember what year it was, maybe 2009.
[2]I'm trying to recall this because it was so long ago.
[3]Q So did you continue to read mammography after
[4]you closed the Mammography Center of Winter Park in
[5]2009?
[6]A I did, yes.
[7]Q Through whom or through what imaging entity?
[8]A I just can't recall. I can't recall what I
[9]was reading from at that point. Mammograms were being
[10]sent to me. I think I read mammograms through a company
[11]called Professional Imaging Centers and from centers
[12]called Florida Radiology Center, which is located in
[13]Winter Park.
[14]Q Have you ever read any SimonMed breast imaging
[15]during the time you've had any relationship reading
[16]SimonMed imaging?
[17]A No, I haven't.
[18]Q During the time that you through EliteRAD has
[19]read any SimonMed imaging, have you limited your review
[20]of imaging to the spine and brain?
[21]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[22]answered.
[23]A No. I read many studies. In fact, the chest
[24]x-ray I just read was for SimonMed, but I read anything
[25]they need me to read. So sometimes they ask me to read
[1]studies. Sometimes I get asked to read studies because
[2]other doctors don't want to read it, but I read -- so I
[3]read all body parts.
[4]The only thing that I do not read is
[5]mammography because I'm not certified. I do not have
[6]the MQSA certification to legally read mammography at
[7]this time. Also I do not read breast MRIs for SimonMed.
[8]I don't read breast MRIs for anyone for that matter.
[9]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[10]Q In order to read breast MRIs, is there some
[11]type of certification or qualification that you don't
[12]have?
[13]A No.
[14]Q You just do not do it by choice, and you're
[15]not asked to do it; is that correct?
[16]A That's correct. It's highly litigious, and I
[17]used to do it, and I enjoyed doing it. I enjoy being
[18]able to help find people's breast cancer, but it's
[19]not -- the actual work itself is not enjoyable to me, so
[20]it's not something I seek out.
[21]Q When you -- strike that.
[22]So whatever the year was that your MQSA
[23]certification lapsed is when you stopped professionally
[24]reading mammography, correct?
[25]A That's correct, and I don't know that exact
[1]date. I'm giving you estimates.
[2]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[3]testimony.
[4]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[5]Q So we could find out when your MQSA
[6]certification lapsed, and whatever date that is is when
[7]you no longer professionally read breast mammography,
[8]correct?
[9]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[10]testimony.
[11]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[12]Q Professionally?
[13]MS. HENRY: Same objection.
[14]A That's correct, because I would not read
[15]mammograms without the certification. I have looked at
[16]mammograms. I have looked at mammograms many times, and
[17]I look at them even today if somebody shows them to me,
[18]but I do not provide interpretation.
[19]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[20]Q You said you would not legally be able or
[21]qualified to read breast mammography without
[22]certification. Isn't that what you said?
[23]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, vague,
[24]compound, lack of predicate.
[25]A No. I don't know exactly what I said, but the
[1]MQSA is a law. It's a federal law which requires
[2]certain certifications to be able to provide
[3]interpretations on mammography, so I don't provide
[4]interpretations on mammography. However, I still look
[5]at mammograms because I do know how to read mammography,
[6]and sometimes having the information is useful in coming
[7]up with a diagnosis particularly in other body parts.
[8]I have to correct one of my answers. I do
[9]read breast MRIs, and I believe I've read breast MRIs
[10]for SimonMed for the detection of breast implant rupture
[11]only. Those are the only breast MRIs that I read at
[12]this time. And when I read those MRIs I put a qualifier
[13]on there that this study was not done for the detection
[14]of breast cancer and that a different protocol needs to
[15]be used if they're concerned about breast cancer.
[16]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[17]Q Why do you put that qualification or limit the
[18]scope of your review of breast MRI to ruling in or
[19]ruling out implant rupture versus diagnosis of breast
[20]cancer?
[21]A Well, because there is different techniques
[22]used in MRI. MRI is not just like a hammer. It's not
[23]one tool. It's like a multi tool. You can do many
[24]things with MRI, and when you're detecting breast
[25]cancer, you need to inject contrast, which some people
[1]call x-ray die. You have to inject this material, which
[2]needs to be injected in the patient intravenously to
[3]detect.
[4]A breast implant rupture, you don't need that.
[5]You only need to do the basic MRI, and you can see the
[6]implant and see if it's been ruptured or not.
[7]Q Before today when was the last time you gave a
[8]deposition?
[9]A I gave a deposition last week sometime. I
[10]just don't remember the day.
[11]Q And what was your role or capacity in giving a
[12]depo last week?
[13]A Well, I don't recall the event exactly, but
[14]usually when I give a deposition it is in a situation
[15]where I am a treating doctor on a patient where I found
[16]an abnormality, and I'm asked to discuss the
[17]abnormalities that I find.
[18]Q So you don't remember the general
[19]circumstances of what your deposition was for last week
[20]other than you were an interpreting radiologist?
[21]A Well, if I had some papers or something to
[22]help remind me, for example, if I knew the patient's
[23]name, if I knew what day it was, I might be able to give
[24]you further details, but right now I just can't remember
[25]everything that I did last week.
[1]Q Can you tell me approximately how many
[2]depositions you've given?
[3]A No, but it's a very large number.
[4]Q Thousands?
[5]A No. It's not that large.
[6]Q A thousand?
[7]A I probably give -- prior to 2015 I gave
[8]probably 12 to 15 a year, and now I give -- and that
[9]really started around 2006, 2007, although I have been
[10]giving depositions since the '90s, maybe one or two a
[11]year. So it's increased, and now I probably give 80
[12]depositions a year, certainly more than one a week.
[13]Q How long have you been giving about 80
[14]depositions a year?
[15]A Well, as I said, it's been increasing every
[16]year, so it was only 12 to 15 a year or one or two a
[17]month prior to 2015. Then in 2015 it really started --
[18]it really took a peak, and it went up to probably about
[19]40 a year, and then the next year it was probably 50 and
[20]then 60 and 70. So it's probably 80 a year now.
[21]Q What do you attribute that increase to?
[22]A Well, I attribute it myself to the fact that
[23]when I show people abnormalities, I show them the
[24]abnormality. In other words, radiology is the only
[25]objective evidence, and I teach the jury what they're
[1]looking at, so that when they look at this objective
[2]evidence they'll know what they're looking at, and then
[3]I let them see it with their own eyes.
[4]Q You don't think it has anything to do with
[5]your business relationships, that significant increase
[6]in your deposition testimony?
[7]A No. I don't think it has anything to do with
[8]that at all. In other words, I think if I wasn't very
[9]good at this, people would stop asking me. In fact, it
[10]would be great if they did because actually I don't
[11]particularly like giving depositions, although I don't
[12]dislike it. It's not terrible, but, for example, if you
[13]were not here doing this deposition, I would be wearing
[14]a T-shirt and shorts and would be much more relaxed.
[15]Q How many times have you testified in trial?
[16]A Again, that's many -- I would say it's many
[17]times. I probably testify in trial now as many times as
[18]20 times a year. I testify -- however, that has also
[19]been increasing over the years. It used to be once or
[20]twice a year, and then once a month. It was about once
[21]a month around 2014, and so now it's about 20 times a
[22]year, so it's increased.
[23]Q All told since the '90s, approximately how
[24]many times have you testified in trial? Certainly more
[25]than a hundred?
[1]A Sounds like it's probably about in that
[2]neighborhood, around a hundred times.
[3]Q And to the extent of your deposition
[4]testimonial experience, would you agree that probably
[5]90-plus percent of the time you're testifying for the
[6]plaintiff?
[7]A I would say that I testify for the plaintiff
[8]the majority of the time now. In the past --
[9]Q 90-plus percent, right?
[10]MS. HENRY: Barbara, if you would please not
[11]interrupt the witness.
[12]MS. FLANAGAN: I don't think I was
[13]interrupting him.
[14]MS. HENRY: You were.
[15]A I wasn't finished actually, but I would say
[16]that now -- in the past prior to 2015 it was still a
[17]majority of plaintiffs, but there was a significant
[18]amount of defense work that I was doing. Now I would
[19]say that it's -- it has increased over time, so now it's
[20]almost exclusively for the plaintiff when I go to court.
[21]However, in depositions it's probably greater
[22]than 95 percent. It's not exclusive.
[23]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[24]Q Greater than 95 percent for the plaintiff?
[25]A Correct. Although, I don't actually testify
[1]for the plaintiff. I just come in and say what the
[2]abnormalities are in my opinion, and it's the plaintiff
[3]that asked me to do that.
[4]Q And for cases in which you're testifying for
[5]patients who have brought litigation generally speaking,
[6]the referring physician is somebody you have an existing
[7]relationship with, right?
[8]A Well, only as a treating doctor. In other
[9]words, I don't always know the treating -- referring
[10]physicians. And even Dr. Wilson, I don't particularly
[11]know Dr. Wilson particularly well. I've never been to
[12]his home. I don't know where he lives.
[13]Q But you consider Mauricio Chiropractic and Dr.
[14]Wilson clients of EliteRAD, right?
[15]A I would say they're clients in that they're
[16]referring doctors, yes.
[17]Q When was the last time before today you
[18]testified in trial?
[19]A Last week I testified on Tuesday. That case I
[20]do remember.
[21]Q You were testifying at the request of the
[22]plaintiff?
[23]A Yes, ma'am.
[24]Q And was it an auto negligence case?
[25]A No.
[1]Q What kind of case was it?
[2]A It was on a patient who had had a -- an injury
[3]in which she had fallen and broke her kneecap, and she
[4]had a very obvious fracture, and the defense expert in
[5]that case said there was no fracture. It was very
[6]obvious, so my job was very easy. I had to come in and
[7]show the x-ray. Fortunately, most jurors know what a
[8]broken bone looks like, so that was an easy one, but it
[9]was one in which there clearly was an issue with what
[10]the defense experts were saying.
[11]Q So it was a slip and fall case?
[12]A I think that's what you call that, yeah.
[13]Q Do you know Dr. Torres?
[14]A I met Dr. Torres on one occasion.
[15]Q What occasion was that?
[16]A A meeting was held by SimonMed at the
[17]Isleworth Country Club, a country club in the golf
[18]course Isleworth, which I thought was a little
[19]extravagant for a business meeting, which is why I
[20]remember it so well. And all of the doctors were there,
[21]and they were there specifically to meet me, and it was
[22]held by SimonMed.
[23]Grant Nelson held it, and I remember the
[24]location was chosen by a doctor, Dr. Jose Pizarro,
[25]Pizarro. Dr. Pizarro -- I met him that night, and
[1]I met all of the other doctors that were working at
[2]SimonMed that night including Dr. Torres.
[3]Q So why was this business meeting held so that
[4]doctors could meet you?
[5]A I guess they were introducing me to them, and
[6]they told them that I would be reading -- EliteRAD would
[7]be reading studies for SimonMed. And SimonMed at that
[8]time was having some problems keeping doctors on staff.
[9]Not that they were having a problem keeping doctors, but
[10]they were having a problem having enough doctors to read
[11]all of their studies, so at that time we were reading
[12]their overflow.
[13]And we were reading all sorts of studies for
[14]SimonMed. We were reading many CT scans, particularly
[15]for cancer evaluation, many x-rays, and basically
[16]anything that the doctors were overwhelmed with.
[17]Q So what was your contact with Dr. Torres, just
[18]minutes or just a hello introduction?
[19]A I remember very specifically Dr. Torres. She
[20]told me, as long as you don't read my breast MRIs, we'll
[21]get along just fine. And that was kind of -- I tried to
[22]make some more pleasantries with her, and that was
[23]pretty much it, but I do remember that one statement
[24]because it was almost -- it was kind of threatening to
[25]me, and I wasn't sure if there was meat to the threat or
[1]not.
[2]Q What year was that?
[3]A That would have been when I first started
[4]working with SimonMed, so I'm thinking that was 2015,
[5]but because of that event, just to be clear, I've been
[6]very careful in any dealings I've had having anything to
[7]do with breast MRI or radiology.
[8]Q Were there other radiologists who were
[9]employed by SimonMed at that time of that business
[10]meeting at Isleworth who you understood to be breast
[11]imagers other than Dr. Torres?
[12]A No. I did not meet anybody else who was a
[13]breast imager, although I think there may have been
[14]people that were reading mammography, but they were not
[15]breast imaging people dedicated to breast imaging.
[16]Q Do you know Dr. Wyndham?
[17]A No.
[18]Q Have you heard his name?
[19]A No. What is his first name?
[20]Q Wayne.
[21]A That name is not ringing a bell, although I
[22]may have seen his name.
[23]Q When you give a deposition in a medical/legal
[24]case, are you routinely asked what percentage of your
[25]income is derived from medical/legal review?
[1]A Yes, ma'am.
[2]Q And what do you say?
[3]A I usually say that it's less than five
[4]percent.
[5]Q But of the imaging that you review, is it your
[6]impression that less than five percent of those patients
[7]are in litigation or your involvement is less than five
[8]percent in litigation?
[9]A Well, it depends on how you evaluate these
[10]patients. First of all, I don't know which ones are in
[11]litigation and which ones are not unless it gets to a
[12]point where I'm being called to be in litigation with
[13]the patient.
[14]Q Well, you know they're in litigation if you're
[15]being asked to give a deposition, right?
[16]A Certainly. So if we go on that number, there
[17]are 80 depositions, which some of those 80 depositions
[18]are multiple depositions on the same person, but even if
[19]you say they're each a different person at 80, I read
[20]about 20,000 exams a year, so that is less than one
[21]percent. So that certainly is not an accurate depiction
[22]of how many of my patients I'm sure are in litigation.
[23]I'm sure many more are.
[24]Q Well, in addition to the radiology
[25]interpretation that you do through EliteRAD, you also
[1]read cases that represent imaging where you have not
[2]read the patient's, but a lawyer is asking you to read
[3]it, right?
[4]A Yes. In those cases I consider myself to be
[5]an expert witness because I do not have a doctor-patient
[6]relationship in that situation.
[7]Q And when you are retained by an attorney to
[8]review imaging, it's your testimony that less than five
[9]percent of your income is derived from that?
[10]A Oh, it's far less than five percent in that
[11]situation because that's a minority of the cases in
[12]which I testify in. So when you put that up with all my
[13]sources of income, certainly that is less than five
[14]percent.
[15]Q Because the majority of the depositions you
[16]give are in your capacity of having read the imaging
[17]through a relationship with a referring physician?
[18]A Correct. Well, that is certainly one of the
[19]reasons.
[20]Q Do you charge by the hour for depositions if
[21]you're testifying about your professional
[22]interpretation?
[23]A Typically I charge a thousand dollars per
[24]hour, and most depositions are done within one or two
[25]hours, so it's usually two hours that we charge, so it's
[1]$ 2,000 for a deposition. When I go into trial, it's
[2]$ 3,000 for the half day or $ 5,000 for the full day
[3]because trial always takes more time. But I try to cap
[4]it at what we normally would make as a radiologist.
[5]For example, today this is taking me out of my
[6]work. I can't work to do today's deposition. I'm not
[7]charging for this because it's not in my capacity as a
[8]treating physician or as an expert witness, but it is
[9]certainly taking me out of work.
[10]Q And if you review a case at the request of the
[11]a lawyer, what do you charge an hour for reading
[12]imaging?
[13]A Well, our charge is normally -- for everything
[14]is a thousand dollars per hour, but usually when I read
[15]a case for an attorney, it's usually one case, and they
[16]ask for a report on it, and we charge $ 250 for that
[17]report.
[18]Q Have you generated any notes as a result of
[19]your involvement in reading Myriam Wilson's breast
[20]imaging from June 2016 at the request of her son?
[21]A No, not at all.
[22]Q Did you look at Ms. Wilson's breast imaging
[23]recently in anticipation of this deposition?
[24]A Not for this deposition. I was told by my
[25]wife that there was a -- that she read somewhere under a
[1]subpoena that I was told not to go into any further
[2]records on Ms. Wilson, although I have gone through
[3]Ms. Wilson's records multiple times.
[4]Q Has anybody provided you with hard copies of
[5]Myriam Wilson's imaging since June 30, 2016?
[6]A No. No one has ever provided me with any hard
[7]copies on Ms. Wilson.
[8]Q Have you met with Ms. Wilson's attorneys,
[9]either Ms. Henry or Mr. Allen, before your deposition
[10]today?
[11]A No. I just met Ms. Henry today, in fact.
[12]Q Have you spoken with either one of them on the
[13]phone?
[14]A No, although I did speak with Mr. Wilson, and
[15]to my recollection, I don't recall him being with the
[16]attorney, his attorney at the time. So to my
[17]recollection, no, although he did tell me he was
[18]involved in litigation, and his attorney may have been
[19]present. I just don't have a recollection of it.
[20]Q When did you most recently speak with Jerrod
[21]Wilson?
[22]A Oh, a long time ago. That was quite a while
[23]ago. I would say -- I don't even have an accurate
[24]estimate on that. I have difficulty determining time
[25]just because there are so many of these types of events
[1]that occur to me on a daily basis. Mr. Wilson -- I have
[2]not spoken to Mr. Wilson in quite a long time.
[3]Q When you spoke with Jerrod Wilson you said his
[4]attorneys might have been present. Did you speak with
[5]him in person or on the phone?
[6]A It was on the phone. That's why I don't
[7]remember if his attorney was present or not.
[8]Q Do you have a vague recollection that he told
[9]you that his attorney was on the phone with him?
[10]A No. I just know there was an attorney, and I
[11]asked him about, that if he had an attorney, and he told
[12]me that there was. And I remember at the time -- I just
[13]remember speaking with Mr. Wilson and him telling me
[14]there was a lawsuit because they asked me if I would be
[15]a witness in the case, they meaning his team.
[16]He was telling me his mother was actively
[17]involved in litigation, which he was helping his mother
[18]in this, and they asked me if I would be a witness for
[19]them on this case. And that is what that conversation
[20]was about. That's why I'm thinking his attorney may
[21]have been present, but not to my recollection.
[22]Q Did he ask you what he wanted you to be a
[23]witness about or the scope of your being a witness?
[24]A No, because I said I would rather not. I
[25]didn't want to be involved in the case. I didn't want
[1]to be in the situation I'm in right now.
[2]Q Well, you know that Mr. Wilson's parents had
[3]you on their witness list as a witness?
[4]A I don't know that. I asked them not to, and
[5]they told me they would not have me as a witness,
[6]although I imagine they may now, but I specifically
[7]asked them to not mention me in this case, and they told
[8]me they would respect my wish. They were not happy with
[9]that, but they said they would respect my wish
[10]because -- when I told him this, I said, Jerrod, I'm
[11]sorry, but I really don't want to be involved in this
[12]case. And he said to me, listen, you saved my mother's
[13]life; I'm not going to bring you into this case.
[14]Q When did he tell you that?
[15]A That's what I'm having a hard -- that's
[16]actually I think the last time I spoke with him. I
[17]can't remember when that was.
[18]That is not the last time I spoke with him. I
[19]spoke with him one other time in which -- I did speak
[20]with him one other time I think in which I told him I
[21]was being deposed in the case.
[22]Q Do you not recall his asking you to look at
[23]his mother's earlier imaging that you had not looked at
[24]in 2015, and your agreeing to do that and doing that?
[25]A I do remember that.
[1]Q So your request to him that you not be
[2]involved, was it before or after you voluntarily
[3]reviewed the 2015 breast imaging on his mother?
[4]A It was probably at the same time. Actually,
[5]let me make this clear. It was not a 2015 study that I
[6]was asked to review. It was one that was prior to that.
[7]I read -- I saw the 2015 study when I saw the 2016
[8]study, which is why I knew she had breast cancer.
[9]It was a very obvious breast cancer, the one I
[10]saw in 2016, because it was present in 2015 and it had
[11]grown significantly in size.
[12]Q Did you tell Jerrod Wilson that you had
[13]reviewed the 2015 imaging at the same time as he asked
[14]you to look at the June 2016 imaging?
[15]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[16]A I did not say it in that way. What I would
[17]have said to Dr. Wilson is I saw -- the actual event
[18]that Dr. Wilson had asked me to do, to just take -- to
[19]take a look at his mother's scan to make sure she was
[20]okay because she had a history of breast cancer. I then
[21]said I have to talk with your mother and get permission
[22]from your mother.
[23]He put me on speaker phone with his mother,
[24]and he did the translating because his mother does not
[25]speak English, and I remember this event, and I remember
[1]his mother saying, yes, that I had permission to talk to
[2]her son. So at that point I told -- I then took a look
[3]at the scan, and I saw there was a scan done in 2016
[4]that was interpreted. It had a preliminary report on
[5]it.
[6]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[7]Q Hold on. I don't want to get into a
[8]narrative, so let me ask you some questions first, if
[9]you don't mind?
[10]MS. HENRY: Ms. Flanagan, I think it's
[11]improper for you to interrupt a witness in the
[12]middle of an answer even if it turns into a
[13]narrative. The witness should be allowed to
[14]complete his answer, and then you can go back and
[15]break it down certainly, but he is entitled to give
[16]you his complete answer.
[17]MS. FLANAGAN: It's going beyond the scope of
[18]the question, so I want this to be orderly, and I
[19]want to have some understanding of what he is
[20]responding to, and I'm going to let you say
[21]whatever you want to say, Dr. Mahan, but if you
[22]could do me a favor and try to limit your responses
[23]to what I'm asking you.
[24]A I'll try to, but I'm trying to -- I'm trying
[25]to illustrate that.
[1]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[2]Q Okay. But --
[3]A I apologize it's longer than I thought. I'll
[4]try to make it shorter.
[5]Q So what --
[6]MS. HENRY: Hold on. Wait, wait. I just want
[7]to put a response on the record to that, the
[8]instruction from Ms. Flanagan to the witness.
[9]Certainly we all want this to be done orderly, but
[10]Dr. Mahan is entitled to give as long an answer as
[11]he believes is necessary to make his responses
[12]accurate and complete. And if you would like to
[13]follow up afterwards, certainly you can do that,
[14]but there is no limitation on the length of his
[15]answers. It's in his own discretion.
[16]MS. FLANAGAN: I disagree with you.
[17]MS. HENRY: That's fine.
[18]MS. FLANAGAN: I'm entitled to a responsive
[19]answer. I'd like to make sure that we try to limit
[20]it to that.
[21]MS. HENRY: You're certainly entitled to a
[22]responsive answer, but he is entitled to give you
[23]his answer in its entirety. Then if you don't
[24]believe it's responsive, certainly you can follow
[25]up in that manner, but I would ask you to please
[1]not cut short Dr. Mahan's responses. Thank you.
[2]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[3]Q Dr. Mahan, do you remember the exact date --
[4]MS. HENRY: Actually I'm sorry. I think that
[5]Dr. Mahan -- you had said you would let Dr. Mahan
[6]finish his answer. I'm not sure if we're too far
[7]beyond that, but his answer -- I would just note
[8]for the record -- it will speak for itself -- but
[9]his response was not yet complete.
[10]MS. FLANAGAN: I'll agree it was not complete.
[11]I'm interrupting it.
[12]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[13]Q Dr. Mahan, can you tell me the exact date that
[14]Jerrod Wilson asked you to initially read his mother's
[15]breast imaging that was performed at SimonMed?
[16]A No. I don't recall. I know it was in 2016,
[17]and I know it was -- it was after the MRI was performed
[18]and prior to the time that Dr. Torres signed the report
[19]because I saw her preliminary report, and I saw that she
[20]missed it. In fact, she had called it something else.
[21]So I had at that point intervened, and I
[22]intervened by specifically talking to Grant Nelson.
[23]Q Okay. And we're going to get there.
[24]MS. HENRY: No, no, no, no, no. He is
[25]entitled --
[1]MS. FLANAGAN: This is totally gratuitous.
[2]I'm entitled to ask a question. I don't need him
[3]to go beyond this. This is -- he does not need to
[4]volunteer information.
[5]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[6]Q If you wouldn't, please, I would appreciate
[7]it. I just want a direct answer. It was what is the
[8]date.
[9]A I just don't know the date.
[10]MS. HENRY: Ms. Flanagan --
[11]A But the date was between the time the MRI was
[12]performed and prior to the date she signed it.
[13]MS. HENRY: I would object to Ms. Flanagan's
[14]description of Dr. Mahan's response as gratuitous.
[15]And, Ms. Flanagan, I would ask you again to please
[16]let the witness complete his answer. If you would
[17]then like to re-ask him the question with your
[18]admonition to please make it responsive, that is
[19]fine but he is entitled to give his entire answer
[20]as he sees appropriate without your interruption.
[21]Thank you.
[22]MS. FLANAGAN: No, he is not. He wouldn't be
[23]-- he wouldn't be entitled to if the judge were
[24]here.
[25]MS. HENRY: Well, we may get to that point,
[1]but he is entitled to give whatever length of
[2]answer he believes is appropriate.
[3]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[4]Q Okay. So, Dr. Mahan, can we agree that you
[5]had no involvement in the interpretation of Myriam
[6]Wilson's breast imaging performed at SimonMed before
[7]June 30, 2016?
[8]A No, because I don't remember the dates that
[9]we're talking about. I told you that it was after the
[10]date that the MRI was performed and prior to the date
[11]she signed it, and I don't know what those dates were.
[12]Q Do you at least acknowledge it was in 2016?
[13]A Yes, I do remember it was in 2016.
[14]Q So if the breast MRI was done on June 28,
[15]2016, what you can say is that it was after June 28,
[16]2016, right?
[17]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates his
[18]testimony, improper predicate, lack of foundation.
[19]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[20]Q Did Jerrod Wilson ask you to simply read the
[21]breast MRI that was done on June 28, 2016 at SimonMed?
[22]A He did not ask me to read it. He asked me to
[23]look at it and see if I thought his mother did not have
[24]a breast cancer on there.
[25]Q Did Jerrod Wilson tell you that he had any
[1]knowledge of any interpretation of his mother's breast
[2]imaging done on June 28, 2016 at SimonMed at the time he
[3]asked you to look at it?
[4]A I know that he did not have the knowledge of
[5]the interpretation because the preliminary report had
[6]not gone out, and he was not aware of the preliminary
[7]report. And, in fact, I know that because I went to
[8]efforts to get Dr. Torres to change her report.
[9]MS. FLANAGAN: Move to strike as not
[10]responsive.
[11]MS. HENRY: That's fine. Dr. Mahan, just so
[12]you know, there is no such thing as move to strike
[13]on the depo transcript.
[14]MS. FLANAGAN: Sharon, you don't need to
[15]comment on it. It's not an objection. You don't
[16]need to have any colloquy.
[17]MS. HENRY: Neither is move to strike, and I
[18]think it's misleading to the doctor.
[19]MS. FLANAGAN: He has done depositions many
[20]times. He knows what the procedure is.
[21]MS. HENRY: I'm sure he does.
[22]MS. FLANAGAN: And I'm sure he has heard a
[23]motion to strike as nonresponsive.
[24]MS. HENRY: I'm sure he has. Nonetheless, I
[25]would not be representing my clients to the best of
[1]my ability if I failed to make that statement on
[2]the record.
[3]BY MS FLANAGAN:
[4]Q Okay. Dr. Mahan, have you had a chance to
[5]look at the depo notice for your deposition today?
[6]A I looked at it only briefly.
[7]Q Do you have any of the documents or responsive
[8]items that you have been requested to bring subject to
[9]the request that you not go in the SimonMed imaging
[10]system?
[11]A Yes, I see that.
[12]Q Do you have any of the responsive items in
[13]your possession?
[14]A No.
[15]Q Have you ever?
[16]A No. Can I go off the record for one second?
[17]MS. FLANAGAN: Sure.
[18]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[19]Q Dr. Mahan, do you have any items in your
[20]possession that relate to Myriam Wilson other than what
[21]is described in the depo notice that you have in your
[22]possession?
[23]A No, none.
[24]Q Did Jerrod Wilson tell you anything about his
[25]mother's breast cancer history or treatment history when
[1]he asked you sometime after June 28, 2016 to review her
[2]breast imaging that was just done?
[3]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, compound.
[4]A He went through her history at the time.
[5]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[6]Q How long were you on the phone with him?
[7]A I was on the phone at least three or four
[8]times with him, and I probably was on the phone with him
[9]I remember several other times after that because I
[10]wanted to make sure his mother had a biopsy because I
[11]felt there was a greater than 99 percent chance that she
[12]had breast cancer.
[13]Q So initially when he calls, is it out of the
[14]blue asking you to do him a favor and look at his
[15]mother's imaging?
[16]A That's correct.
[17]Q At that time he was a referring physician and
[18]you had a relationship with him as a referring physician
[19]client, correct?
[20]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[21]answered.
[22]A And as an acquaintance and as a good friend of
[23]a friend. In other words, he was a good friend of my
[24]employee who I consider my employee to be my friend as
[25]well.
[1]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[2]Q Did he ask you to specifically look at his
[3]mother's breast MRI? Did he specify what breast imaging
[4]he wanted you to look at, or did he say any of the
[5]imaging that she just had?
[6]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[7]answered.
[8]A Well, I don't recall if he was specific at
[9]all, but since she had the breast MRI done on 6/28,
[10]which I just got that date from you, I'm sure that's
[11]what he probably wanted me to do, but I just don't
[12]remember.
[13]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[14]Q Well, did he mention any awareness that she
[15]underwent a left breast mammogram or left breast
[16]ultrasound on the same day at SimonMed, June 28, 2016,
[17]that she had a bilateral breast MRI?
[18]A I don't recall him saying that. I don't
[19]recall ever seeing the mammogram or the ultrasound. I
[20]don't think I ever looked at those things because the
[21]breast cancer was so obvious on the MRI. I didn't need
[22]it.
[23]Q So even as of today, you don't recall looking
[24]at either the June 28, 2016 left breast mammogram or the
[25]left breast ultrasound?
[1]A I don't recall, although I may have three
[2]years ago looked at those things. I don't recall doing
[3]it, and the MRI was so obvious to me that I would not
[4]have needed to.
[5]Q Is it your testimony that you believe that you
[6]looked initially at the breast MRI assuming that you
[7]looked at any of the other studies, that you would have
[8]looked at the breast MRI first?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Because you would have had access to know what
[11]studies were done on June 28, 2016 since you were going
[12]in the SimonMed PACS system, right?
[13]A Yes, and theoretically I may have gone
[14]through, but I don't recall doing it, and I don't -- and
[15]I wouldn't have needed to. In other words, there is
[16]nothing on the mammogram or ultrasound that would have
[17]changed my mind.
[18]Q But assuming that -- strike that.
[19]So when Jerrod Wilson calls you sometime after
[20]June 28, 2016 and asks you to do him a favor and look at
[21]his mother's breast imaging that was just done, you
[22]said, I can't do it without her consent because that
[23]related to a HIPAA issue, correct?
[24]A I just always want the patient's consent. I
[25]did it before HIPAA existed. I would still do that with
[1]a patient because I believe a patient -- because when I
[2]went through my training I had a situation in which a
[3]divorced couple was involved and which a -- or a couple
[4]going through a divorce wanted to know each other's
[5]medical secrets. And I've always been told you should
[6]always get the information from the person themselves,
[7]so I always do that as a policy.
[8]Q So during this initial conversation with
[9]Jerrod Wilson where he asked you to do him this favor
[10]and read his mother's imaging and you say, well, I need
[11]to have her consent first, he said, well, I have her
[12]here, and he put you on speaker phone and she gave
[13]consent after he translated it in Spanish, correct?
[14]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[15]answered.
[16]A That's correct.
[17]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[18]Q And so during this conversation he gave you
[19]some history of her whole breast cancer history?
[20]A That's correct.
[21]Q And what did he tell you?
[22]A I don't recall. I don't recall what details
[23]he said. I can only tell you what I remember seeing on
[24]the images.
[25]Q Did he tell you that his mother initially had
[1]a lumpectomy on her right breast, and that she had
[2]recurrent cancer and underwent a total mastectomy in
[3]2004 and had never elected chemo or declined chemo,
[4]declined radiation, any of that information?
[5]A I don't recall what he told me.
[6]MS. HENRY: Object to form, compound.
[7]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[8]Q So you knew from your review of the imaging
[9]that there was radiographic evidence that she had a
[10]total mastectomy of the right breast, correct?
[11]A That's correct.
[12]Q And you knew from the radiographic appearance
[13]of her left breast that she had an implant in the left
[14]breast, correct, or do you remember that?
[15]A I don't remember what was in the other breast.
[16]I remember the appearance of the cancer, and that's
[17]really all I remember. I haven't gone through the
[18]imaging at any time in recent memory.
[19]Q Do you remember there being approximately a
[20]two-year delay from when he first asked you to do him a
[21]favor and look at his mother's imaging in June 2016 and
[22]then in his reconnecting with you and asking you to do
[23]him a favor and look at other imaging on his mother in
[24]the SimonMed PACS system in 2018?
[25]A No, I don't recall that. I just don't recall.
[1]Q Did you advise anyone in advance at SimonMed
[2]that Jerrod Wilson had asked you to do him a favor and
[3]look at his mother's imaging that was performed at
[4]SimonMed before you did it?
[5]A No.
[6]Q You were not looking at his mother's imaging
[7]in June 2016 in the SimonMed PACS system on behalf of
[8]SimonMed, were you, when you looked at it?
[9]A That's correct.
[10]Q You were doing it as a favor to him, correct?
[11]A That's correct, as a favor to him and his
[12]mother, the patient.
[13]Q And the only reason why you had access to his
[14]mother's imaging at SimonMed in June 2016 is not because
[15]you were the official reader of the imaging but because
[16]you had a business relationship with SimonMed through
[17]EliteRAD to read non-breast images or breast imaging,
[18]but only for purposes of ruling out and ruling in
[19]rupture of implants, correct?
[20]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[21]A No, that's not correct. I could have easily
[22]been given those images by Mr. Wilson by disk. I do
[23]second opinions on a regular basis all the time, so
[24]Mr. Wilson could have handed me those images separately.
[25]In this case it was not necessary.
[1]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[2]Q I understand that, but you were not looking at
[3]it in an official capacity? You were looking at it in a
[4]favor capacity, right?
[5]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[6]A That's correct, and I do it also on a regular
[7]basis for acquaintances and friends that I have.
[8]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[9]Q Is it your testimony that you recall clearly
[10]in June 2016 not only looking at the imaging that had
[11]just been done a day or two earlier, but that you also
[12]specifically recall looking at the 2015 imaging at that
[13]time?
[14]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates
[15]testimony.
[16]A Definitely. I have no doubt in my mind
[17]because one of the things that was most egregious in
[18]Dr. Torres' report was she wrote in her report there had
[19]been no change, and I could not believe an attending
[20]radiologist could not notice the change in this case.
[21]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[22]Q So if Jerrod Wilson has testified that he has
[23]no recollection of your telling him anything about your
[24]impressions of the 2015 imaging and you only spoke with
[25]him about the 2016 imaging, is that incorrect or
[1]inaccurate as far as your recollection is concerned?
[2]A Well, I know --
[3]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[4]predicate.
[5]A -- it's inaccurate. I mean, I imagine -- I
[6]can only speculate as to why Dr. Wilson might have said
[7]that, but at that point he was worried about his mother
[8]having breast cancer, so he probably didn't remember.
[9]For me in my capacity, not only do I remember
[10]seeing it, I remember that being the biggest evidence
[11]that this was almost certainly cancer. If you see a
[12]mass, it could be many things, but if you see a mass
[13]that is growing this much in a one-year period, it's
[14]almost certainly cancer.
[15]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[16]Q Do you have a clear recollection of telling
[17]Jerrod Wilson that you compared the 2016 with the 2015
[18]imaging when you first spoke with him about your
[19]impression sometime after June 28, 2016?
[20]A I don't remember exactly what I told
[21]Dr. Wilson, but I would imagine I would have said that
[22]because I would have given him a detailed description as
[23]to what I said. But as you can see, I'm somewhat
[24]long-winded. He may not have remembered that.
[25]Q So after June 2016 what opportunity did you
[1]have to read any other imaging on Myriam Wilson that was
[2]in the SimonMed PACS system?
[3]A Well --
[4]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[5]A -- at that point I just remember this case. I
[6]went in there a couple of times just to look at it
[7]because it was quite shocking to me. I may have gone in
[8]there -- sometimes -- I teach doctors on a regular
[9]basis. I don't think I used it in a teaching capacity
[10]in any way because I don't teach breast imaging, but I
[11]may have gone in there a couple of times myself to make
[12]sure and look to see she was being taken care of, to see
[13]if there was any other studies being done.
[14]And I do know I went in one other time when
[15]Dr. Wilson showed me a prior study that was even before
[16]the 2015 study. I remember him showing me a prior
[17]study, an image from a prior study.
[18]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[19]Q How could Dr. Wilson show you an image from a
[20]prior study on his mother? Did he send it to you by
[21]email? Did he provide you with a hard copy on disk?
[22]Did he do it in person?
[23]A No, I don't remember how that happened, but I
[24]think I had the entire study, so he may have sent it to
[25]me by disk, but I just don't remember.
[1]Q What was the year of this prior study that he
[2]subsequently sent to you?
[3]A Again, I can't remember that either. It may
[4]have been 2000 -- it was quite a while ago like 2009 or
[5]something. It was quite a while ago, and I just can't
[6]remember.
[7]Q But did he send you this 2009, 2010 study on
[8]his mother just out of the blue unsolicited?
[9]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[10]testimony.
[11]A No. He sent -- I don't recall the event. I
[12]do know I had the entire study when I looked at it, so I
[13]probably would have had the disk.
[14]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[15]Q I understand, but why did he send it to you?
[16]A I mean, you'd have to ask Dr. Wilson.
[17]Q What did he tell you was the purpose for
[18]sending it to you?
[19]A He asked me to take a look and see if it was
[20]there -- that this mass was there back at that time.
[21]Q Mass in what breast?
[22]A In the breast that her cancer was in, which
[23]would have been the right breast.
[24]Q When he sent you this pre-2015 breast study,
[25]was it a breast MRI, a mammogram or ultrasound of the
[1]right breast?
[2]A I remember it being an MRI.
[3]Q What year was it that he sent you this
[4]pre-2015 breast MRI?
[5]A Again, I can't recall that.
[6]Q And did he send it to you by mail? Did he
[7]send it to you by email? Did he send it to you by
[8]courier from Mauricio? How was it sent to you?
[9]A I just can't remember.
[10]Q Did you ever look at any breast imaging on
[11]Myriam Wilson in Jerrod Wilson's presence?
[12]A I don't remember having seen that in
[13]Dr. Wilson's presence, although I may have seen that
[14]disk in Dr. Wilson's presence. I don't know how I got
[15]those images, so I can't remember the event.
[16]At this point I was sort of out of
[17]Ms. Wilson's care. My only goal in taking care of
[18]Ms. Wilson was to make sure she got her breast cancer
[19]taken care of.
[20]Q How many times did you go in Myriam Wilson's
[21]imaging through the SimonMed PACS system without Jerrod
[22]Wilson asking you to do that after June 2016?
[23]A Oh, several times.
[24]Q Like five or --
[25]A No. I mean, I went in there taking a look at
[1]her MRI because it was quite -- it's probably one of the
[2]worst mistakes I've ever seen. The mistake was not in
[3]missing the cancer. The mistake was in the doctor's
[4]complete refusal to admit she made a mistake, and it
[5]was -- it was a problem that fortunately did not turn
[6]out worse, but that was the mistake in this case. And I
[7]probably have been in there several times looking at
[8]that.
[9]Q So when did you most recently look at Myriam
[10]Wilson's breast imaging in the SimonMed PACS system?
[11]A I don't know, but I have not been in there
[12]since I was told not to. I don't know the date.
[13]Q When were you told not to?
[14]A In this March 27, 2019 Amended Notice for
[15]Taking Deposition Duces Tecum, and it certainly would
[16]have been some period of time before then would have
[17]been the last time that I saw it.
[18]Q Did Jerrod Wilson provide you with any other
[19]pre SimonMed breast imaging on his mother other than a
[20]2009 or 2010 breast MRI?
[21]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates
[22]testimony.
[23]A Not to my recollection. I don't recall.
[24]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[25]Q Just to be clear, the imaging that you were
[1]provided that was in 2009 or thereabouts, that was a
[2]breast MRI that was a bilateral study, correct?
[3]A I don't recall what I looked at at the time.
[4]All I know is I looked at something that was done
[5]remotely some time ago. I believe it was an MRI because
[6]I would have been comparing apples with apples, and I
[7]remember the mass in 2015 was a new finding, although
[8]there was a cluster of lymph nodes in that area on the
[9]prior exam, but the mass was new.
[10]Q And you're sure it was a breast MRI that was
[11]around 2009?
[12]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[13]testimony, asked and answered.
[14]A No, not at all. I'm not sure when it was. I
[15]just know I saw something prior, and I think it was an
[16]MRI, but I just don't have a good recollection. I don't
[17]have a good recollection of the event. I really at this
[18]point was kind of out of this situation, and I had asked
[19]to stay out of the situation.
[20]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[21]Q Did Jerrod Wilson ask you to go into the
[22]SimonMed PACS system at some point after June 2016 for
[23]the purpose of telling you when any non SimonMed breast
[24]imaging on his mother was imported into or pulled into
[25]the system?
[1]A No. I would not even know how to do that, so
[2]if he did, my answer would have been I don't know how to
[3]determine that.
[4]Q When you looked at this earlier breast MRI
[5]that was before 2015 that was not done at SimonMed on
[6]Myriam Wilson, did you read it at SimonMed, or did you
[7]read it here in your house?
[8]A Well, I don't read anything at SimonMed. I
[9]would have done all of this at my house, but I would
[10]have looked at that at my house as well, and it would
[11]not have been in the SimonMed system because I don't
[12]recall seeing that in the SimonMed system. I recall
[13]that being separate.
[14]Q Did you call up Jerrod Wilson and tell him
[15]what your impression was of this pre-2015 breast MRI
[16]that was done somewhere other than SimonMed?
[17]A I don't recall the events from that, from that
[18]situation very well. I just remember having seen the
[19]images, so I don't know if I called Dr. Wilson or if he
[20]called me or if he gave me perhaps a note saying, please
[21]call me when you see this. It could have been any of
[22]those.
[23]Q When he first called you and asked you to do
[24]him a favor and read his mother's breast imaging, you at
[25]least knew that she had a history of right breast
[1]cancer, correct?
[2]A Yes, and I could see she had a mastectomy.
[3]Q Did you recall being told that she had a
[4]history of being diagnosed with more than one episode of
[5]breast cancer, an initial breast cancer or recurrence of
[6]breast cancer in the same right breast?
[7]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[8]answered.
[9]A I don't remember what her history was.
[10]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[11]Q Did you have any discussions with Jerrod
[12]Wilson as to whether he reached out to the SimonMed
[13]radiologist to find out of what that radiologist's
[14]impression or interpretation was before you read it as a
[15]favor?
[16]A I know he did not because I did not instruct
[17]him to. The reason I know that is because I know the
[18]events. I tried to get Dr. Torres to change her report
[19]before she signed it.
[20]Q We have you in the audit trail for the breast
[21]MRI that was done on Myriam Wilson performed on June 28
[22]for the first time on June 30, 2016. Does that sound
[23]like the appropriate time frame?
[24]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[25]answered.
[1]A It does sound like the appropriate time frame
[2]because I remember -- one thing I do remember is that
[3]the MRI had been performed sometime before, but it had
[4]not been signed yet, and I thought that was unusual
[5]because most radiologists do their work on the same day.
[6]So Dr. Torres was at least two days behind, and I do
[7]remember that. I remember strikingly, why is Dr. Torres
[8]taking so long to do this report.
[9]So and then I was happy she had not signed it
[10]because I felt I might be able to intervene before she
[11]signed it, so I do remember that yes.
[12]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[13]Q So according to the SimonMed audit trail,
[14]you're in the breast -- left breast ultrasound at seven
[15]a.m. You would not dispute it, but you don't remember
[16]being in it?
[17]A That's correct. I may have opened up her
[18]other study to just see what they showed.
[19]Q So basically you don't have an impression as
[20]you sit here today thinking I see obvious cancer in her
[21]left breast based on your review of the mammogram,
[22]right?
[23]A I did not see -- I don't ever remember seeing
[24]a cancer in that breast, correct.
[25]Q So as you sit here today, what you were most
[1]focused on and what was so memorable to you was what you
[2]considered to be obvious cancer in the right breast,
[3]correct?
[4]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[5]answered.
[6]A That's correct, and that was from my memory
[7]from four years ago, of course.
[8]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[9]Q And the cancer that you saw on the right
[10]breast, you were looking at 2016 studies first, correct,
[11]that had just been done two days earlier according to
[12]the audit trail, right?
[13]A Well, I don't recall that, but that's what I
[14]would have normally done.
[15]Q And if you were in the left breast -- strike
[16]that.
[17]If you were in the left breast ultrasound and
[18]the left breast mammogram on June 30, 2016, as you sit
[19]here today you have no memorable thoughts about your
[20]impressions of the interpretation or your review of
[21]those two studies, correct?
[22]A That's correct, but although I would say that
[23]when -- I do know that when Dr. Wilson asked me to take
[24]a look at his mother's studies, it would not be unusual
[25]for me to look at all of the studies that she had done
[1]that day in response to his request.
[2]Q I understand, but in doing that, your memory
[3]was that you were impressed with the right breast MRI
[4]and you had no impression or have no recall of being
[5]impressed with the left breast imaging that was done on
[6]June 28, 2016, correct?
[7]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[8]answered.
[9]A That's correct.
[10]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[11]Q And you were looking at the breast imaging at
[12]least with some generalized context that Jerrod Wilson
[13]told you, my mother has a history of right breast cancer
[14]the details of which are not super clear to you right
[15]now, but that generally she had right breast cancer,
[16]correct?
[17]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[18]answered.
[19]A I don't even know that she has right breast
[20]cancer. I just remember him telling me the history. It
[21]was four years ago that he told me the history.
[22]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[23]Q Well, you knew she had right breast cancer
[24]because you could see the evidence of the mastectomy,
[25]right?
[1]A That's correct, but to answer your question, I
[2]don't remember what he said to me. I just don't
[3]remember. It's not that he didn't. He actually went
[4]through quite an extensive history at the time. I
[5]remember that. I remember I had two distinct
[6]conversations that I remember that day, one in my
[7]office.
[8]And then I had a second conversation when I
[9]was in my car. I don't know why I was in my car. It
[10]may have been that I could not reach him, and maybe he
[11]called me back or maybe it was after I tried to get
[12]Dr. Torres to change her report.
[13]Q So when he called you and asked you to do him
[14]a favor and read his mother's imaging, was it on the
[15]same day that you pulled it up, or was it the day before
[16]or two days before?
[17]A No. It was the same day. I would have done
[18]it immediately.
[19]Q So if you're in the imaging audit trail for
[20]June 30th, you believe that he called you before
[21]7:00 a.m. on June 30th and said, hey, Dr. Mahan, can you
[22]look at my mother's imaging that was done two days ago
[23]at SimonMed?
[24]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[25]A I'm not sure that seven a.m. is correct. I
[1]don't do anything at seven a.m. I imagine that is a
[2]different time. That is probably Arizona time. And it
[3]was probably closer to ten a.m. that I may have looked
[4]at it, but that would have made sense in that sense,
[5]becomes I don't -- I don't even -- I don't do that for
[6]anybody.
[7]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[8]Q When you told him you would look at the
[9]imaging and you speak with him initially, did you pull
[10]up the imaging and give him any thoughts during that
[11]first phone call?
[12]A I don't recall that. I think what -- I think
[13]that when I saw the images, I would have studied those
[14]images and I would have realized I had some serious bad
[15]news that I have to give this person. And I believe at
[16]that point I was far more concerned about getting the
[17]report changed because the report was originally
[18]written -- the preliminary report did not mention
[19]anything about a biopsy.
[20]Q We'll come to that in a second.
[21]A So that was my primary concern. So at that
[22]point I spoke with Grant Nelson to get him to change the
[23]report, and that may be why I didn't speak with
[24]Dr. Wilson again until later in the day to give him the
[25]bad news.
[1]Q So where was the right breast cancer on the
[2]June 28, 2016 right breast MRI?
[3]A It was in the far outer aspect of the breast.
[4]It was a large, brightly enhancing solid mass that was
[5]in the outer breast and I remember measuring
[6]approximately five centimeters.
[7]Q Was it in the axilla?
[8]A I remember it being in the outer breast. I
[9]can't remember if it was in the upper outer breast,
[10]which would be the axilla region, or if it was in the
[11]lower outer breast, but I remember it being in the outer
[12]breast. It may have been towards the axilla.
[13]Q Was it a mass independent of a lymph node or
[14]did you think it was representative of cancer in a lymph
[15]node?
[16]A The only way to determine that would be
[17]through pathology. In other words, a pathologist has to
[18]take it out and cut it open. It could be a cancer that
[19]is independent of the lymph node. It could be a cancer
[20]that invaded the lymph node. They would look identical
[21]on the MRI.
[22]Q So when you reviewed the breast MRI, did you
[23]then look at the 2015 breast imaging that was in the
[24]system, or did you start communicating with anyone just
[25]as a result of your review of the 2016 imaging?
[1]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[2]answered.
[3]A No. I would always look at the 2015 study
[4]because you need to see if it's stable. If it's stable
[5]it could be a benign known entity. If it's enlarging --
[6]if it's shrinking it's probably not cancer, but if it's
[7]enlarging, it's almost certainly cancer.
[8]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[9]Q So then you could not make any definitive
[10]conclusion based upon your review of the 2016 breast MRI
[11]as to whether this mass in the axillary region was
[12]cancerous or not without a base of comparison by looking
[13]at prior imaging, correct?
[14]A No, that is incorrect. Just based on the 2016
[15]study, this is suspicious for cancer. If you have a
[16]previous study it certainly helps you, so with the
[17]previous study it became almost certainly cancer. So
[18]using the BI-RADS category, BI-RADS 1 is normal and 5 is
[19]highly suspicious for cancer. If I only had the 2016
[20]study, I would have given this a BI-RADS 4, suspicious
[21]for cancer, but with the previous studies I give it a
[22]BI-RADS 5, highly suspicious for cancer.
[23]Q What was it about the appearance of this mass
[24]in the axillary region in the right breast in June 2016
[25]that caused you to believe that it was suspicious for
[1]cancer?
[2]A Well, first of all, it's a solid mass
[3]measuring five centimeters in size. That alone is
[4]suspicious for cancer unless I can find a sign that
[5]suggests it's benign. There are certain benign tumors
[6]of the breast like fibroadenomas, but they have
[7]characteristics of being benign. If they don't have
[8]characteristic for being benign even fibroadenomas
[9]should be biopsied.
[10]In this case we have a solid mass, and also we
[11]have an MRI, and the MRI showed rapid enhancement. This
[12]lesion enhanced very quickly, which is a sign for
[13]cancer, and also it's extremely bright. This mass is
[14]markedly bright. Those are the two MRI findings that
[15]are suspicious for cancer: Rapid enhancement and
[16]brightness.
[17]So we -- this has three characteristics that
[18]put it into the suspicious category. That still does
[19]not mean it's cancer of course, but the correct thing to
[20]do at this point is to get a biopsy of it, and then when
[21]we had the prior study then it became highly suspicious.
[22]Q So did you look at the 2015 imaging before you
[23]looked to see how anybody had interpreted the 2016
[24]imaging?
[25]A Probably not because when I opened the -- I
[1]don't know for a fact. I don't know for sure, but when
[2]I opened up the 2016 study, Dr. Torres' preliminary
[3]report would have come up.
[4]Q Are you a hundred percent certain that a
[5]preliminary report existed when you were in the audit
[6]trail for the breast MRI according to the audit trail at
[7]7:15 a.m.?
[8]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[9]predicate.
[10]A I don't know when the preliminary report was
[11]done, but I am a hundred percent certain that I saw that
[12]preliminary report that day without a doubt before she
[13]signed it because I intervened to get her to change her
[14]report, and she did change her report. So I'm certain
[15]that I saw it.
[16]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[17]Q You're certain you saw a preliminary report
[18]for Dr. Torres' review of the June 28, 2016 breast MRI
[19]on June 30, but you're not sure what time of day and
[20]when in relation to your own review of the imaging on
[21]June 30, correct?
[22]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[23]testimony.
[24]A That's correct, but I think I saw it at the
[25]same time, and the reason for that is because what I did
[1]immediately afterwards.
[2]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[3]Q Have you been shown or has anybody talked to
[4]you about the audit trail for the PACS imaging on Myriam
[5]Wilson?
[6]A No. I don't know anything about it, but I do
[7]know that audit trails exist. I know how to interpret
[8]them.
[9]Q So if the audit trail suggests you were in
[10]Ms. Wilson's breast MRI before even Dr. Torres was in it
[11]on June 30, 2016, would you acknowledge that when you
[12]were first in it her preliminary report did not exist?
[13]A Yes, if that is what the audit trail would
[14]show that that's what happened, and I may have gone in
[15]there and seen it and then gone back in and seen the
[16]preliminary report. It may have been in that order. As
[17]I said, I can't recall the exact order of events.
[18]MS. HENRY: Object to the last question,
[19]improper predicate.
[20]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[21]Q All right. So after you got finished looking
[22]at the June 2000 -- strike that.
[23]After you got finished looking at the June 28,
[24]2016 bilateral breast MRI, did you then look at the 2015
[25]bilateral breast MRI?
[1]A Sometime thereafter, yes.
[2]Q At some point in time did you have both
[3]studies up on companion screens to compare them?
[4]A I don't remember exactly what I did when I
[5]compared them, but what I would have done -- I probably
[6]would have done that because it's very easy to see the
[7]increase in size.
[8]Q Do you have the ability here in your home
[9]office to look at things comparatively? You have two
[10]screens?
[11]A I only need one screen to do that because you
[12]can split the screen an as many individual screens as
[13]you want.
[14]Q But you're a hundred percent sure that you
[15]looked at the 2015 imaging on Myriam Wilson on June 30,
[16]2016 at the time you reviewed her June 28, 2016 imaging?
[17]A Yes. I don't know if I looked at them at the
[18]exact same time or if I looked at them later in the day,
[19]but I know that I looked at those at the exact -- I do
[20]know that I did comparison prior to my telling
[21]Dr. Wilson the bad news.
[22]Q So did you look at all of the 2015 breast
[23]imaging on Myriam Wilson or would you have limited your
[24]review to the breast MRI?
[25]A I can't recall. I would not have needed to
[1]look at anything else because it's such a rapid -- a
[2]massive change in size.
[3]Q So since you didn't see anything in the left
[4]breast imaging including the mammogram, ultrasound and
[5]the left breast MRI, you would have probably looked at
[6]the left breast imaging in 2015 or really not looked at
[7]it?
[8]A I don't recall what I did.
[9]Q Because your focus was on, is there something
[10]on the right -- in the right breast in the 2015 imaging.
[11]And if the only 2015 imaging of the right breast was an
[12]MRI, would you have limited your review to the 2015
[13]breast MRI?
[14]A I can't recall what I did as far as the left
[15]breast was concerned. At this point I knew there was --
[16]I was worried about saving Ms. Wilson's life.
[17]Q Okay. So when you looked at the right breast
[18]MRI from 2015, did you come to the conclusion that there
[19]was cancer in the right breast in 2015?
[20]A Yes, definitely.
[21]Q Because you saw this mass whether it be lymph
[22]node or independent mass in the axillary region in the
[23]right breast in the same locations in 2015 as in 2016?
[24]A That's correct.
[25]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[1]predicate.
[2]A To be clear, I don't know that I shared that
[3]with Dr. Wilson. I just wanted to make sure that
[4]Ms. Wilson got a biopsy. That's what I was concerned
[5]about, what I could do today.
[6]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[7]Q Whether you shared it with him or not, you
[8]were looking at the 2015 right breast MRI to see whether
[9]this mass was in the right axillary region that was
[10]there in 2015, and whether it was the same size, smaller
[11]or larger, correct?
[12]A Correct.
[13]Q And base upon this comparison of the right
[14]breast MRI imaging from 2015 and 2016, how did the 2015
[15]MRI of the right breast compare to the 2016 MRI of the
[16]right breast?
[17]A Well, there was still a mass there. It was
[18]probably about half the size, about three centimeters in
[19]size as opposed to five centimeters. I know that is
[20]more than half by distance, but when you talk about
[21]volume, you have to remember this is a spherical shape.
[22]So five centimeters in diameter is probably twice the
[23]size as a three centimeter.
[24]Those are the numbers that I seem to remember.
[25]I remember it being quite large. It may have been two
[1]and four, but it was a big difference in size between
[2]these lesions, and I needed to see the prior study to be
[3]able to see that. If they were the same, I would have
[4]still recommended this be biopsied. It could still be a
[5]slow-growing cancer.
[6]Q When you reviewed the -- strike that.
[7]Did you ask Jerrod Wilson for any prior
[8]imaging on his mother before 2015 when you spoke with
[9]him on June 30, 2016?
[10]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[11]answered.
[12]A I don't recall having asked him for anything
[13]prior. At that point I was just wanting her to get a
[14]biopsy so that she could get in the proper hands. I
[15]would have needed prior studies.
[16]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[17]Q Okay. You finish your interpretation. Can
[18]you tell me approximately how long that took?
[19]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, vague,
[20]ambiguous, lack of predicate.
[21]A I can't.
[22]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[23]Q What is the first thing you do after you
[24]finish this comparison between the right breast MRI in
[25]2015 and the right breast MRI in 2016?
[1]A Well, I remember at that time the first thing
[2]I did was I notified the head of SimonMed, Grant Nelson.
[3]Before I contacted Dr. Wilson I contacted Grant Nelson
[4]because I had seen the preliminary report, which
[5]identified there was no cancer.
[6]At that point I had -- because of this
[7]situation I had with Dr. Torres when she told me, don't
[8]read my breast MRIs, I felt she had a certain amount of
[9]animosity toward me, so I specifically told Grant Nelson
[10]to tell Dr. Torres that there was a mass there, that
[11]it's increased in size since the prior exam and that a
[12]doctor looked at this, and they think this is highly
[13]suspicious for cancer.
[14]At that point -- I did not hear from Grant for
[15]another hour or two. Grant eventually -- I asked Grant
[16]to get back to me, and he did get back to me, and he
[17]said, she does not think it's cancer, but I eventually
[18]talked her into at least recommending a biopsy. So I
[19]think that Grant did everything in his power that he
[20]could do.
[21]Q How did you communicate with Grant Nelson
[22]about your impression of Ms. Wilson's 2015 and 2016
[23]breast MRIs?
[24]A By telephone.
[25]Q And it's your testimony that you're certain
[1]that a preliminary report existed, meaning one that was
[2]in the system, had been dictated or typed by Dr. Torres
[3]but not electronically signed and finalized?
[4]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[5]testimony, compound.
[6]A Oh, definitely. It definitely was. I do
[7]know -- I remember that report very distinctly because
[8]she had said left breast BI-RADS 2, which means benign,
[9]and she did not give any BI-RADS for the right breast at
[10]all. And then she said something about there being
[11]something consistent with granulomatous tissue where
[12]this mass was, and she did not recommend a biopsy.
[13]So I was very concerned at this point that
[14]Ms. Wilson would not get a biopsy and could possibly
[15]die. At this point I was worried about saving
[16]Ms. Wilson's life, and I knew if I could get at least
[17]her to recommend a biopsy, then she would get into the
[18]hands of somebody who would find out this is cancer
[19]because at this point I believed that there was a 99
[20]percent chance it was cancer.
[21]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[22]Q Did you know that Dr. Torres was reading the
[23]study on June 30, 2016 of the breast MRI that was done
[24]on June 28?
[25]A I don't know when Dr. Torres read it.
[1]Q Whenever you accessed her report for the
[2]breast MRI that was done on June 28, which you claim you
[3]accessed on June 30, it's your testimony that when you
[4]initially accessed it it was a preliminary report in the
[5]system but it had not been electronically signed and not
[6]finalized, correct?
[7]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[8]testimony.
[9]A That's correct. I saw a preliminary report
[10]that had not been signed.
[11]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[12]Q And you know that it was preliminary because
[13]it had not been signed, or were there other indicators
[14]of the report that told you it was preliminary?
[15]A Well, in the SimonMed system when a report is
[16]signed, it's -- once it's formally signed it can't be
[17]changed, and I knew this was a mistake, that it could
[18]still be changed. I could not change it, but Dr. Torres
[19]could.
[20]Q Meaning because it's preliminary, the person
[21]who created it still has the potential to change it
[22]until it's electronically signed and finalized, correct?
[23]A That's correct.
[24]Q But as you understood from the SimonMed
[25]system, once a report was finalized, meaning
[1]electronically signed by the radiologist, it could not
[2]be changed, but a separate addendum could be prepared,
[3]for example, if that were indicated?
[4]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, compound.
[5]A Well, to be completely clear, that is the
[6]proper way to do it, however, I do know there are IT
[7]people who can change reports and do things they're not
[8]supposed to do, but that is improper, and I don't recall
[9]there being anything like that happening in this case.
[10]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[11]Q So when you spoke with Grant Nelson to discuss
[12]with him your interpretation, it's your testimony the
[13]preliminary report existed and was in the system and you
[14]accessed it?
[15]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[16]answered, vague, compound.
[17]A That's correct.
[18]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[19]Q And your reason for not contacting Dr. Torres
[20]directly and telling her that you thought it was cancer
[21]was because you thought that she would react in an
[22]adversarial manner?
[23]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, leading.
[24]A That's correct. I've had that experience
[25]trying to tell doctors they are wrong in the past, and
[1]in this case I did not care to be right. I just cared
[2]about Ms. Wilson being taken care of, so I thought if
[3]Dr. Torres thought it might potentially be a referring
[4]doctor or someone else, then she might be more
[5]open-minded to changing her report, which she did.
[6]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[7]Q Was there any discussions between you and
[8]Grant Nelson that you speak with Dr. Torres directly
[9]about your impressions of the 2015 and 2016 breast MRIs
[10]on Ms. Wilson?
[11]A You mean as far as me talking to Dr. Torres?
[12]Oh, yes, we did. We both agreed that that would
[13]probably happen, that she would not be responsive in a
[14]positive manner.
[15]Q And Grant Nelson was what position as of June
[16]30, 2016 relative to Dr. Torres?
[17]A Well, I don't know exactly what his position
[18]was, but I do know he functioned as the head of all of
[19]SimonMed here in Florida.
[20]Q Is he a radiologist?
[21]A No, ma'am.
[22]Q Is he an M.D.?
[23]A No, ma'am.
[24]Q Have you spoken to Grant Wilson --
[25]MR. MORING: Nelson.
[1]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[2]Q I'm sorry. Have you spoken with Grant Nelson
[3]about the fact that you had been set for deposition in
[4]this case?
[5]A No.
[6]Q Have you spoken with Grant Nelson about your
[7]interpretations of Ms. Wilson's breast imaging since
[8]June 30, 2016?
[9]A Not to my recollection, no. I have --
[10]Q You have --
[11]A I'm sorry. What I was saying is that I have
[12]spoken with Grant Nelson that this is in lawsuit.
[13]Q That this is a lawsuit?
[14]A That there is a lawsuit going on in this case.
[15]Q When did you speak with him about that?
[16]A It was quite some time ago. When I say quite
[17]some time ago, it was maybe a year ago or within the
[18]last year.
[19]Q Did you reach out to him, or did he reach out
[20]to you, or how did that happen?
[21]A I don't know. We talk to each other from time
[22]to time, so I don't know if it happened to be in a phone
[23]conversation or where I happened to say, oh, and by the
[24]way, and it may have been something like that. I don't
[25]think it would have been a focus of a phone call.
[1]Q So is it your testimony that you've only
[2]spoken with Grant Nelson on June 30, 2016 about your
[3]interpretation of Myriam Wilson's breast MRI imaging
[4]done at SimonMed?
[5]A No. That's not what I said at all.
[6]Q How many times have you talked to him about
[7]it?
[8]A Oh, during that week I probably spoke with him
[9]every day. During that period of time I spoke with
[10]Grant on a daily basis, sometimes two or three times a
[11]day.
[12]Q About Myriam Wilson's breast imaging?
[13]A No, about business, but during that period of
[14]time we would have discussed this case in those
[15]conversations because this was something we were both
[16]concerned about and we wanted to make sure that
[17]Ms. Wilson was properly taken care of. Our concern was
[18]patient care.
[19]Q So your conversation with Grant Nelson occurs
[20]where you tell him that you disagree with Dr. Torres'
[21]interpretation, and you have a rather high confidence
[22]level that she has cancer in her right breast, and he
[23]said he'll get back with you. And then when does he
[24]speak with you next or vice versa that day?
[25]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[1]testimony and leading, asked and answered.
[2]A I can't recall when he called me back. I'm
[3]not even sure if it was the same day. I just don't
[4]recall.
[5]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[6]Q So do you believe that you spoke with Jerrod
[7]Wilson before you got any call back or had any further
[8]contact with Grant Nelson that day?
[9]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[10]answered.
[11]A I don't know. I don't recall the exact series
[12]of events. There were many phone calls made to Grant
[13]Nelson during the course of that day, and at some point
[14]during the day I would have -- I would have asked him,
[15]did you finally talk with Dr. Torres, and then he said,
[16]I talked with Dr. Torres; she still doesn't think it's
[17]cancer, but she agreed to have a biopsy done. So that's
[18]when I knew she was going to put in her report to do the
[19]biopsy.
[20]I know I went back into the case at sometime
[21]later to make sure I saw the signed report and saw that
[22]it was -- that she had recommended the biopsy. I
[23]remember that very clearly because I remember she still
[24]had not changed the BI-RADS from a 2 to a 4, and BI-RADS
[25]2 means you don't have to do a biopsy, so I was a little
[1]concerned about that being denied from payors.
[2]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[3]Q So what time of day did you speak with Jerrod
[4]Wilson on June 30, 2016 to tell him what your impression
[5]was?
[6]A I can't even recall for certain if it was
[7]June 30th, but I think it was, and I think it was after
[8]work, and I'm going to guess it was probably around six
[9]p.m. because I remember very distinctly being on the
[10]phone with Jerrod Wilson about this issue when I was on
[11]the corner of Tuskawilla Road and Aloma Avenue. I
[12]remember being in that location, driving a car, being on
[13]the phone and having this discussion with him.
[14]And I don't know if that was the first
[15]discussion or a second discussion or if he called me
[16]when I was in a car to get a follow-up with it, a
[17]follow-up to get further instruction. I just can't
[18]recall, but I do remember that one conversation I had
[19]with him.
[20]Q Do you believe that this conversation that
[21]occurred around six p.m. when you were driving and at
[22]the corner of Tuskawilla Road and Aloma is when you told
[23]him that you thought his mother had cancer?
[24]A I don't know because, like I said earlier, I
[25]don't know if that was the conversation or if that was a
[1]follow-up conversation.
[2]Q So what did you discuss with him during this
[3]conversation when you are driving?
[4]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[5]answered.
[6]A I just can't recall what I said, but I do know
[7]during my conversations with Mr. Wilson on that day I
[8]told him that I believed that there is a mass in her
[9]breast, that in my opinion it was highly worrisome for
[10]cancer -- I could be wrong I told him -- I may be wrong
[11]about it, but she needs to get a biopsy; please make
[12]sure your mother is biopsied; no matter what happens,
[13]make sure she gets in to somebody to get a biopsy; I'm
[14]going to do everything on my end to make sure it's
[15]clear.
[16]And I remember saying something to the extent
[17]that if -- because at this point I think I was still
[18]concerned that Dr. Torres would not change her report,
[19]so I said, if you need to have a second opinion report,
[20]I will give you a second opinion report and maybe we can
[21]get that clear.
[22]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[23]Q Did you discuss with Jerrod Wilson the
[24]preliminary report that you claim existed for Dr.
[25]Torres?
[1]A I don't recall having that discussion with
[2]him.
[3]Q Did you disclose to Jerrod Wilson anything
[4]about the report content for Dr. Torres' interpretation
[5]of the breast MRI when you spoke with him on June 30,
[6]2016?
[7]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, vague,
[8]ambiguous, improper predicate.
[9]A I just don't recall what I said to him about
[10]Dr. Torres' report. My concern was getting Ms. Wilson
[11]into a biopsy and getting that report changed.
[12]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[13]Q Did you advise Dr. -- strike that.
[14]Did you advise Jerrod Wilson on June 30, 2016
[15]that in your opinion Dr. Torres misread any imaging on
[16]his mother?
[17]A I would not have volunteered that information,
[18]but if it was asked of me, I would have answered it, so
[19]I just don't recall.
[20]Q If Jerrod Wilson had told one of his mother's
[21]providers that he had his mother's imaging from June 28,
[22]2016 read by another radiologist who felt this was a
[23]malignancy in the right axilla, is that consistent with
[24]what you conveyed to him at some point?
[25]A It turned out to be a malignancy, so I would
[1]say probably it was.
[2]Q Do you remember it was in the right axilla
[3]ultimately when it was biopsied?
[4]A Well, the axilla is in the outer breast,
[5]considered the upper outer quadrant, so it certainly
[6]probably was in that region. I can't recall if it was
[7]in the axilla or it was in the outer breast. It seemed
[8]to me to be in the axillary region on my memory, but I
[9]have not seen those images in quite some time.
[10]Q After June 30, 2016 did you ever give Jerrod
[11]Wilson any opinions about any post June 2016 breast
[12]imaging on his mother?
[13]A Not to my recollection.
[14]Q Did you give Jerrod Wilson any opinions about
[15]any non-breast imaging on his mother after June 28, 2016
[16]that was intended to be staging imaging?
[17]A Not to my recollection. He may have asked me,
[18]but again, the only reason that this one case stands out
[19]to me is only because of the issues involved in it he
[20]may -- I mean, people do ask me these things, and I
[21]don't always remember them.
[22]Q When you looked at the pre-2015 breast MRI,
[23]whatever year it was, 2009 somehow sticks out in your
[24]mind though, right?
[25]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[1]A It could have been 2007 or 2009. It was some
[2]time ago. I just can't remember, yeah right.
[3]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[4]Q Or maybe 2010?
[5]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[6]answered.
[7]A Or 2010. It could have been any of those.
[8]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[9]Q Or 2008?
[10]MS. HENRY: Object to the form. Asked and
[11]answered.
[12]A Or 2008.
[13]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[14]Q You think most likely it was earlier than --
[15]either on or earlier than 2010?
[16]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[17]answered.
[18]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[19]Q Right?
[20]A I don't know that. I mean, I'm going on
[21]recollection of an image that I saw one time some time
[22]ago.
[23]Q And was it an image of the right breast?
[24]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[25]answered.
[1]A It was a bilateral breast study, and I believe
[2]it was an MRI. I think that was -- for some reason it
[3]is standing out to me that I was kind of shocked that
[4]there was an MRI that existed from that time ago when I
[5]saw it, but I can't remember the event, and I don't even
[6]remember when I saw it.
[7]I don't remember -- I remember seeing an
[8]entire study, but I don't remember if Mr. Wilson mailed
[9]it to me or if he had it couriered over here. It's very
[10]possible he had it couriered over. He could have given
[11]it to my employee who he is friends with, and my
[12]employee may have sent it me. So I mean, there is
[13]several ways he could have gotten it to me.
[14]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[15]Q So you looked at it, whatever year it was, and
[16]did you come to the conclusion this earlier MRI was
[17]suspicious, or not?
[18]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[19]answered.
[20]A I did not evaluate that to determine if it was
[21]suspicious. I took a look at it to see if there is any
[22]-- at this point I was not concerned about there being
[23]any abnormalities except for the one I knew was there.
[24]So I really was focused when I looked at it.
[25]And I saw there was a collection of lymph
[1]nodes there, but there was not this mass that was there
[2]in either 2015 or 2016.
[3]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[4]Q So you don't recall an enlarged lymph node in
[5]the same area on the imaging study that you looked at
[6]that was pre-2015?
[7]A Well, I remember there being lymph nodes
[8]there. That's all I remember, and I know it had a
[9]distinctly difference appearance.
[10]Q Distinctly different appearance in the earlier
[11]imaging?
[12]A It was different in the early imaging compared
[13]to the 2015 study or 2016 study. In other words, this
[14]is something -- what is present in the 2015 study and
[15]2016 study is something that is new and different. What
[16]is in 2015 and 2016 are rapidly enhancing, bright, solid
[17]masses. That did not exist at that time.
[18]Q Do you recall there being enlarged lymph nodes
[19]at that time on that earlier study, whatever year it
[20]was?
[21]A Well, the cluster --
[22]MS. HENRY: Object to form.
[23]A -- of tissues that was there in that same
[24]region include lymph nodes, which there are normally
[25]lymph nodes located in that area.
[1]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[2]Q Do you remember what the size of any of the
[3]lymph nodes were in that region on whatever prior study,
[4]whatever year that was?
[5]A No, and I don't have any records on it. I
[6]just know it was different.
[7]Q Did you send any texts to Grant Nelson
[8]relating to your impressions of Myriam Wilson's imaging?
[9]A Not to my recollection.
[10]Q Did you send any texts to Dr. Torres about her
[11]interpretations of Myriam Wilson's imaging?
[12]A I would not have sent any texts to Dr. Torres
[13]for the reasons that I told you. In fact, one of the
[14]doctors when I caught her making a mistake, another
[15]doctor, she blocked me on all messages, so I didn't want
[16]to have that situation with Dr. Torres.
[17]So that is what I was trying -- in other
[18]words, I have a history of finding doctors' mistakes and
[19]having them do something very bad to me, so I only try
[20]to get the problems fixed. That was really my only
[21]goal.
[22]Q So did you have any discussion with Grant
[23]Nelson or -- strike that.
[24]Did you have any discussion with Jerrod Wilson
[25]about his mother's imaging on June 30 that you have not
[1]told me about and that I have not asked you about?
[2]A No, I don't think so.
[3]Q Did you learn by some means after June 30,
[4]2016 that Jerrod Wilson's mother was diagnosed with
[5]cancer?
[6]A Yes. I actually -- I don't know if I followed
[7]up with it or if Jerrod Wilson called me to let me know,
[8]but I did know -- I knew it happened right afterwards.
[9]I know that Jerrod Wilson thanked me for saving his
[10]mother's life.
[11]Q So he told you that she underwent a biopsy in
[12]the right breast and it confirmed she had breast cancer?
[13]A I don't remember the exact details, but he did
[14]tell me that whatever -- that it did turn out to be
[15]cancer, which I sort of already highly suspected.
[16]Q Did you have any other discussion with Jerrod
[17]Wilson about his mother having cancer anywhere other
[18]than in the right breast?
[19]A No, ma'am.
[20](Doorbell rings.)
[21]THE WITNESS: Excuse me. Can we go off the
[22]record for one moment?
[23](Brief recess.)
[24]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[25]Q Okay. So after you were told by Jerrod Wilson
[1]that his mother had a biopsy that confirmed she had
[2]cancer in the right breast, you don't have any
[3]recollection of speaking with him about her having
[4]breast cancer elsewhere; is that correct?
[5]A That's correct, not to my recollection.
[6]Q When Jerrod Wilson asked you to review this
[7]earlier breast MRI study whatever year it was, is there
[8]anything either in your computer or available to you
[9]currently that would enable you to identify what year
[10]that study was that you read?
[11]A No, because it would have come -- it would
[12]have come -- if I had it, it would have come in a disk
[13]and as soon as I pulled the disk out, all of the data
[14]would have been gone with it.
[15]Q Did he represent to you whether or not
[16]Dr. Torres had reviewed that MRI that he asked you to
[17]read?
[18]A He did mention something to the extent of
[19]someone saying they had that MRI prior to 2015 and it
[20]was saying things were not changed. He mentioned
[21]something about that. I don't recall exactly what he
[22]said, and I can't tell you what he said, but there was
[23]some discussion about somebody saying that they had
[24]possession of this or something like that, and I kind of
[25]just don't remember it, or did I -- I didn't really take
[1]it into account in my assessment.
[2]Q Are you sure that it was someone had
[3]possession of it before 2015 or whether it was before
[4]2016?
[5]A I don't even remember anything about the
[6]conversation, to be honest with you. I'll just tell you
[7]there was a conversation about somebody claiming that
[8]they saw this, but I didn't see any records of it. I
[9]remember saying -- I don't -- is there any record of
[10]that, and I remember saying there was no record of
[11]anybody saying that they knew this MRI even existed, so
[12]I did not really take that into account.
[13]Q Were you asking Jerrod Wilson if there was a
[14]record of somebody seeing it, or were you asking
[15]yourself that? I'm not sure what you're --
[16]A Oh, I'm sorry. I would have been asking
[17]myself. I would not have asked him because he would
[18]have no way of knowing. I would have to look at it
[19]myself.
[20]Q So when you get this earlier breast MRI study,
[21]whatever year it was, from Jerrod Wilson, did you go
[22]back into the SimonMed system for any reason?
[23]A I may have. I don't know. I almost certainly
[24]went back into the SimonMed system because I would have
[25]had to do a comparison at that point, so I probably did.
[1]Q Have you ever spoken with Myriam Wilson, his
[2]mother?
[3]A Only the one time that we were on speaker
[4]phone.
[5]Q And your impression is that she does not speak
[6]English?
[7]A I wasn't sure -- that was my impression
[8]because he was speaking in Spanish, so that was my
[9]impression. I didn't ask her if she spoke English, but
[10]she may speak English, but Jerrod started speaking to
[11]her in Spanish.
[12]Q And when Jerrod Wilson gave you this earlier
[13]MRI to look at, you knew there was a lawsuit, right?
[14]A At that point I don't know if he told me there
[15]was a lawsuit, but I would have been able to figure it
[16]out.
[17]Q And did he tell you why he was asking you to
[18]look at it, whether somebody had reviewed it and he
[19]wanted to see what your impression was or whether it had
[20]never been looked at by anybody? Did you understand the
[21]context?
[22]MS. HENRY: Object, compound.
[23]A Oh, I understood the context. I understood
[24]why he was asking me, but I would not have understood
[25]the context necessarily. He wanted to know if this
[1]lesion was there on the prior study, and I know that
[2]when somebody is asking me that, they probably at this
[3]point are wondering if somebody has been negligent.
[4]When we discuss cases of negligence, there is almost
[5]always a lawsuit involved.
[6]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[7]Q So then your assumption was when he asked you
[8]to look at this prior MRI that Dr. Torres had looked at
[9]it, and he wanted to see if your interpretation was
[10]consistent with hers or inconsistent, right?
[11]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates the
[12]testimony.
[13]A No, not at all. I didn't know anything about
[14]Dr. Torres looking at it.
[15]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[16]Q Were you led to believe that someone at
[17]SimonMed had at least looked at this pre-2015 breast
[18]MRI?
[19]A Well, to be clear, as we discussed earlier, I
[20]have some fairly extensive experience in this arena of
[21]medical/legal work, so I'm presuming there are medical
[22]experts involved in this case, and it could have been a
[23]medical expert. It could have been many people who said
[24]that they saw it. I don't know anything about
[25]Dr. Torres' involvement specifically.
[1]Q Did you give Jerrod Wilson any recommendations
[2]for any experts for his parents' litigation?
[3]A I don't think I did. I don't know any
[4]experts, so I doubt that I did. In other words, I don't
[5]know who you should go to for a breast -- I don't know
[6]any breast experts that would testify. I can't even
[7]think of one right now, so I'm sure I didn't do that.
[8]If he asked me, I would have said, I don't know anyone.
[9]Q So when did you go in the system to see
[10]whether Dr. Torres -- strike that.
[11]When you went back in the system after
[12]speaking with Grant Nelson and telling him that you
[13]thought Ms. Wilson had cancer, it was with an eye
[14]towards telling him that you thought Dr. Torres missed
[15]cancer on earlier imaging, right?
[16]A Yes.
[17]Q And when you went in the system to see if
[18]Dr. Torres had finalized her report, it was for you to
[19]confirm whether or not she had made any change to this
[20]alleged preliminary report based upon your contact with
[21]Grant Nelson, correct?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q Because you wanted to see whether what you
[24]told Grant Nelson influenced her final report?
[25]A That is incorrect. I did it because I wanted
[1]to make sure Ms. Wilson got a biopsy and did not die
[2]from a missed cancer. That was my only interest in the
[3]case.
[4]Q When you went back in to look at Dr. Torres'
[5]final report, had you already told Jerrod Wilson that
[6]his mother most likely had cancer and you thought she
[7]needed a biopsy?
[8]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[9]answered.
[10]A I don't recall the exact sequence of events,
[11]but at this point even if I told Mr. Wilson this, if
[12]this report said there is no cancer, he may have
[13]difficulty finding doctors willing to do a biopsy when
[14]there is a negative report out there. And, in fact, he
[15]did have a negative report.
[16]Dr. Torres' report was a negative report. It
[17]doesn't mention anything about cancer, but she said, go
[18]ahead and biopsy it anyway. And that was -- I was
[19]hopeful that that would be enough to get her the biopsy.
[20]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[21]Q But you told Mr. -- strike that.
[22]You told Jerrod Wilson on June 30 your mother
[23]most likely has cancer in her right breast and it needs
[24]to be biopsied to confirm it, right?
[25]A Yes, that's my opinion, but I don't have an
[1]official report. I'm not the official radiologist on
[2]record. This is just Sean Mahan. I happen to have a
[3]friend who is a radiologist who took a look at it, so I
[4]needed to make sure there was some official
[5]documentation that would clear the path for this patient
[6]to get a biopsy.
[7]Q What time of day did you go in to look at
[8]Dr. Torres' final report as you're characterizing it,
[9]the report that she electronically signed for the breast
[10]MRI?
[11]A I can't recall that. I may have looked at it
[12]multiple times even during that week because Grant
[13]Nelson during that period of time would also come to my
[14]office here, sometimes to get things signed or to have
[15]things approved by me, and he may have asked to see it
[16]when he was here. I may have gone into it multiple
[17]times.
[18]Q Why would you go in it multiple times after it
[19]was electronically signed and final?
[20]A Well, as I just described, if Grant Nelson
[21]came here and said, can I see this thing and show it to
[22]me, I would have shown it to him.
[23]Q Do you remember that happening?
[24]A No, but that would not be an unusual event.
[25]Q Well, he could have looked at it independently
[1]of your accessing it, couldn't he?
[2]A He is not am MD or doctor. He doesn't know
[3]what he is looking at.
[4]Q So do you have a specific recollection of
[5]pulling up Myriam Wilson's imaging and showing Grant
[6]Nelson anything on the imaging?
[7]A No. I'm just telling you these sorts of
[8]things happen when there is a missed lesion. In other
[9]words, people want to see the miss.
[10]Q Do you have a specific recollection of ever
[11]pulling up imaging and showing Jerrod Wilson in terms of
[12]your impressions about what was normal and abnormal?
[13]A No. I do remember at some point having
[14]pictures that I gave to Mr. Wilson. I just can't
[15]remember what format I did that in. I don't have any
[16]emails, but I do know I gave him some pictures so that
[17]he could see it so he could show -- he could show the
[18]doctors who would be taking care of her.
[19]Q And what month and year was that?
[20]A I don't recall.
[21]Q How did you give him the pictures? In person?
[22]A No. I would not have done it in person
[23]because I didn't see him at that time. I often give
[24]people pictures in many different ways. I could have
[25]emailed it to him. I could have put them on a flash
[1]drive because I use flash drives very liberally. I have
[2]flash drives all over the house, and I could have -- I
[3]have these low capacity flash drives that I often
[4]transfer images because you can do that in a secure
[5]manner.
[6]Q Did Jeimi Bare work with you?
[7]A Jeimi Bare, she is a SimonMed employee, so I
[8]only worked with her in the capacity that she was a
[9]SimonMed employee.
[10]Q Was she somehow dedicated to assist you in
[11]doing what you needed to do in interpreting SimonMed
[12]imaging?
[13]A Only if she was instructed to by SimonMed.
[14]She certainly didn't do anything particularly for me.
[15]Q Did you request that Jeimi Bare access Myriam
[16]Wilson's breast imaging on June 30, 2016 for any reason
[17]for you?
[18]A Not to my recollection. That would have been
[19]highly unusual. I'm not sure that I knew Jeime Bare in
[20]2016.
[21]Q You worked with her a lot at SimonMed, didn't
[22]you?
[23]A In 2018 --
[24]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, vague.
[25]A Yes, but not in 2016. I don't even know if
[1]she was an employee there in 2016.
[2]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[3]Q Well, she was. How about Christa Meyers? Is
[4]that someone you worked closely with at SimonMed?
[5]A No, I don't know that person.
[6]Q Mr. Pena, did you work with him closely at
[7]SimonMed?
[8]A I did work with him only as he is an employee
[9]of SimonMed, but none of these people followed my
[10]instructions, to be clear. None of these people would
[11]do what I asked them to do. I would have -- only if
[12]Grant Nelson told them to do what I asked them to do.
[13]They were not my employees.
[14]Q So if you asked -- strike that.
[15]So if you created images for Jerrod Wilson
[16]from his mother's imaging in the SimonMed PACS, you're
[17]saying you would not have asked either one, Juan Pena or
[18]Freddie Pena or Jeime Bare to create these images at
[19]your request?
[20]A There is a hundred percent chance I would not
[21]do that because I'm very adept at computers. I can make
[22]my own images. It would take me longer to make a phone
[23]call to Jeime Bare to get pictures than for me to make
[24]pictures myself. It doesn't make sense for me to do
[25]that, but I would never do that anyway because that
[1]would be inappropriate. That would be an inappropriate
[2]use of employees that are not my employees.
[3]Q So you never asked or directed anyone who was
[4]a SimonMed employee to create any images or to provide
[5]anything to Jerrod Wilson that he was getting informally
[6]from you from the SimonMed PACS system?
[7]A That's correct. I would never do that, and
[8]I've never done it the entire time I've worked in my
[9]entire career, in fact. In other words, I can generate
[10]my own images. There is no purpose for me to do that.
[11]Q Did you have any understanding that
[12]Ms. Wilson's breast MRI that you read as a favor to her
[13]son on June 30, 2016 was being motivated because she
[14]felt what she thought was a lump in her left breast at
[15]that time?
[16]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, calls for
[17]speculation, improper predicate.
[18]A I just don't have a recollection of that.
[19]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[20]Q Did you dictate in any fashion your
[21]interpretation of Myriam Wilson's breast imaging either
[22]from June 28, 2016 or May 29, 2015 for Jerrod Wilson or
[23]for anybody else?
[24]A No, ma'am.
[25]Q Have you put in writing to anybody any
[1]interpretation of Myriam Wilson's breast imaging?
[2]A Not to my recollection.
[3]Q Have you spoken with any of Myriam Wilson's
[4]treating physicians?
[5]A No, ma'am.
[6]Q Has Jerrod Wilson or his parents' counsel
[7]shown you any of Myriam Wilson's treatment records for
[8]breast cancer treatment and the breast cancer imaging
[9]from Tennessee?
[10]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, compound.
[11]A Well, I don't know where that MRI was that I
[12]saw. It could have been from Tennessee, so maybe that
[13]was -- that may have been, but I would not have seen any
[14]papers, no documents.
[15]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[16]Q Have you had any discussions with anyone about
[17]your interpretations or impressions of Myriam Wilson's
[18]breast imaging other than Jerrod Wilson and Grant
[19]Nelson?
[20]A My wife.
[21]Q Is that it?
[22]A That I can think of, yes.
[23]Q So it's your testimony that you've seen two
[24]versions of Dr. Torres' interpretation of the June 28,
[25]2016 breast MRI, a preliminary interpretation and then a
[1]final interpretation, right?
[2]A Yes, I definitely did.
[3]Q And you know that the final is the only
[4]version that exists once it's finalized, right?
[5]A I don't know that, but I presume the
[6]preliminary is probably erased.
[7]Q Well, you know that's how it works generally
[8]in radiology, right, that you may have a preliminary or
[9]a draft, and once it's finalized, it's -- the one and
[10]only version of the report is the final report that is
[11]electronically signed, right?
[12]MS. HENRY: Wait just a minute. Object to the
[13]form, improper predicate and leading, vague.
[14]A I don't know what this computer program they
[15]use is capable of. It's possible the program is capable
[16]of recording all preliminary reports that are made, but
[17]I don't know that. I don't know that it is or isn't. I
[18]just -- it's not something that concerns me, so I've
[19]never investigated it.
[20]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[21]Q That's not my question. As a radiologist you
[22]know that once -- strike that.
[23]You know that if you create a draft and read
[24]it and it's a preliminary draft, that once you
[25]electronically sign it, whether you change it or not,
[1]but once you electronically sign that, that becomes the
[2]final version, and it basically replaces the
[3]preliminary, right?
[4]MS. HENRY: Wait, wait, wait. Same objection,
[5]compound, overbroad.
[6]A Well, that was not your question. Your
[7]question was that it didn't exist, that the preliminary
[8]doesn't exist anymore. I don't know that the
[9]preliminary doesn't exist anymore. It may still exist.
[10]As to what you're saying, the final report is the final
[11]report, and that is the one that is the most important.
[12]All of the preliminary reports are no longer relevant at
[13]that point, so to that extent what you are saying is
[14]true. I just don't know that the preliminary reports
[15]don't exist somewhere.
[16]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[17]Q You don't know that they do exist, do you?
[18]MS. HENRY: Same objection.
[19]A That's correct. I don't know if they exist or
[20]don't exist. It would not be -- I know in my computer
[21]program once a preliminary report is made and then
[22]another person makes a final report, the preliminary
[23]report is destroyed.
[24]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[25]Q When you create a final report and you're the
[1]interpreting radiologist, you don't have a preliminary
[2]report that is still in the system, do you?
[3]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[4]predicate, vague, ambiguous.
[5]A Well, what I'm saying is I don't know it's not
[6]still in the system somewhere, but accessible to me,
[7]it's not accessible to me. It may be accessible to an
[8]IT person who has access to all of the data that may be
[9]stored. I don't know that answer.
[10]MS. FLANAGAN: I think I'm going to turn the
[11]questioning over to Mr. Moring. Thank you.

[13]CROSS EXAMINATION
[14]BY MR. MORING:
[15]Q I've got some for you. You okay, or do you
[16]need to take a break?
[17]A No, I'm good.
[18]Q Let's talk a little bit about these employees
[19]of SimonMed that you were just asked about, Jeime Bare
[20]and Christina Meyers, Freddie Pena and Juan Pena. Okay?
[21]I think the questions you were asked with regard to them
[22]may have been limited to this picture you took of some
[23]of the mark-ups on the MRI. I want to try to expand it
[24]if it was.
[25]Did these folks from SimonMed do anything on
[1]your behalf with regard to Mrs. Wilson's imaging?
[2]A No.
[3]Q Is it possible to download an image from
[4]SimonMed and access it off site such that you would
[5]leave no trace in the audit trail to your knowledge?
[6]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to the predicate.
[7]A Not to my knowledge.
[8]BY MR. MORING:
[9]Q Do you recall speaking with any of those
[10]images (sic) at SimonMed about Mrs. Wilson's imaging?
[11]MS. FLANAGAN: You said those images. I think
[12]you meant --
[13]BY MR. MORING:
[14]Q Excuse me. Those individuals at SimonMed.
[15]A I would not have spoken to those individuals.
[16]Those individuals are -- would have been employees that
[17]were not at a level that they would be involved in such
[18]a situation. I would have only spoken with Grant
[19]Nelson.
[20]Q So other than Grant Nelson, you have not
[21]spoken with anyone at SimonMed about Mrs. Wilson's
[22]imaging?
[23]A Yes, absolutely.
[24]Q You had mentioned something about having
[25]familiarity with audit trails. Do you know what -- when
[1]it says export DICOM, DICOM means?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q What does that mean?
[4]A It means someone made an image.
[5]Q Made an image?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q What do you mean by made an image? Can you
[8]define that for me?
[9]A Well, this is somewhat -- may be difficult for
[10]me to explain, but when I pull up -- when I pull up a
[11]radiology study, many images are there, and I have to
[12]scroll through them. Each image is like a JPEG. Are
[13]you familiar with a JPEG?
[14]Q Uh-huh.
[15]A I don't mean to be condescending with these
[16]questions. Well, a DICOM image is just like a JPEG
[17]image, but it has extra data in it, and it allows you to
[18]change the brightness and things, which you can't do
[19]with a JPEG image, so there is extra data in a DICOM
[20]image, but it is very similar to a JPEG image.
[21]And then out of all of these images I can
[22]click one of the images, and then I can export it and
[23]make a JPEG out of it, which is now usable in computer
[24]programs like Facebook. Now you can post these things
[25]if you wanted to.
[1]Q So --
[2]A But you can't post them in the format that
[3]they're on on the original study, so when you say
[4]exporting, exporting is usually exporting an image.
[5]Q So if someone is exporting a DICOM per the
[6]audit trail, that means they have created an image and
[7]they can remove it from the system and do anything they
[8]want with it, right?
[9]A They're not removing it. It's still in the
[10]system. They've made a new image.
[11]Q So what do you do whenever you export DICOM?
[12]Where does that image go?
[13]A Wherever you want it to go.
[14]Q You can make it to where it goes into a thumb
[15]drive? You can put it into the computer?
[16]A Yeah, you can put it on a flash drive.
[17]Q Do you have any knowledge if any of these
[18]folks, Mrs. Pena, Ms. Bare or Ms. Meyers or any of the
[19]other folks, what they would have been doing in Myriam
[20]Wilson's images at SimonMed on the 30th?
[21]A I have no idea, and those are not my
[22]employees. They would not be listening to me.
[23]Q Are there I guess -- in law firms we call them
[24]practice groups where you might have certain attorneys
[25]that do a specific type of work, wills and estates,
[1]trusts, that type of thing, some litigation, contracts,
[2]that type of stuff.
[3]Are there similar practice groups to your
[4]knowledge within SimonMed for the types of radiology
[5]that are reviewed or performed?
[6]A I don't know what happens in SimonMed. Those
[7]employees are SimonMed employees, so they would not have
[8]been loyal to me. They would have been loyal to
[9]Dr. Torres.
[10]Q Do you know if there is a personal injury
[11]group or something similar at SimonMed that primarily
[12]deals with images that are referred by chiropractors?
[13]A They do send chiropractic cases mostly to my
[14]group, but I don't know what they do in SimonMed. I
[15]have no idea what happens in the business dealings of
[16]SimonMed. In fact, I wish I did.
[17]Q So you don't know if these individuals,
[18]Ms. Bare, Mr.s Pena or the other folks that are listed
[19]as accessing Mrs. Wilson's images on the 30th are in the
[20]practice group, for lack of a better term, at SimonMed
[21]that would typically be associated with chiropractor
[22]referrals, do you?
[23]A I would not have any idea. I don't even know
[24]what most of those employees do. I don't know what
[25]their jobs are. The only reason I know Jeime Bare is
[1]because Grant Nelson separated from SimonMed in January
[2]of last year, and Jeime Bare has been replacing him in a
[3]lot of his capacities, and I've been dealing with Jeime
[4]Bare since then, although she was fired on Friday. So
[5]even her, I don't have any dealings with her at all.
[6]Q Similarly, you don't --
[7]A Actually it was not last Friday. It was
[8]Friday about ten days ago.
[9]Q Similarly, you don't know if any of these
[10]individuals when you said "they" would report to
[11]somebody like Dr. Torres, you don't know if she had any
[12]interaction with these people, do you?
[13]A I have no idea what happens in SimonMed.
[14]Q In terms of the pictures -- is that the right
[15]term when you said the thing you created for
[16]Dr. Wilson -- when you said pictures, my understanding
[17]is mark-ups, you make the mark-ups on the imaging from
[18]the MRI, right?
[19]A I don't remember doing that, but I may have.
[20]Q You said there are a variety of ways that you
[21]could have transferred these to Dr. Wilson; is that
[22]right?
[23]A Correct.
[24]Q Have you taken any steps to try to determine
[25]if you have any of those methods of communication?
[1]A Well, I don't have any emails from prior to
[2]2017, so I would not have any emails from that period of
[3]time. It's possible I could have done it through email,
[4]but I would most likely have put it onto a flash drive,
[5]given it to an employee or given it to him or it's
[6]possible I could have sent an email, but I don't have
[7]the emails.
[8]Q My question first was have you taken any steps
[9]to try to locate any correspondence with Dr. Wilson to
[10]determine if you have evidence of the way these pictures
[11]were provided?
[12]A Yes, I have.
[13]Q What steps have you taken?
[14]A Well, I checked my emails to see if any emails
[15]existed on this case, which I did not find any. I also
[16]checked -- I don't have any emails to Dr. Wilson in my
[17]current email server. I just don't have any, so if I
[18]did send him an email, it would have been a while ago,
[19]and that would be really all I could do.
[20]Q Do you have I guess pictures again that you
[21]said may have been created? Have you searched to see if
[22]you have those still?
[23]A I do not have them.
[24]Q Again, the question was have you searched to
[25]look --
[1]A Yes. It's very easy.
[2]Q What steps have you take to determine?
[3]A Every time I have images on -- every time I
[4]have a patient, if I store some images I'm going to
[5]store them some place, and I don't have any stored
[6]anywhere.
[7]Q Even if you do an informal review as opposed
[8]to a formal review where something is associated with
[9]litigation, you're going to create a patient file?
[10]A Well, I usually don't create patient files for
[11]informal reviews because I don't usually have to refer
[12]to them, so I usually delete them to get them off my
[13]computer.
[14]Q Again, trying to circle back, other than
[15]looking for some patient file that may or may not exist
[16]in your custom related to Mrs. Wilson because it is an
[17]informal review, what other steps have you taken to try
[18]to determine if you have any of these mark-ups?
[19]A I went to my office, and my office searched
[20]for them as well, and none of us have any records.
[21]Q Do you recall what it was -- I guess this is
[22]probably a no -- but do you recall what it was that you
[23]would have marked up or shown or referenced in these
[24]pictures for Dr. Wilson?
[25]A I believe what I showed him -- I did show him
[1]that there was a mass there. Keep in mind what my
[2]motivation is, and you can remember -- figure out what I
[3]did. My motivation is to make sure this person who I
[4]think has breast cancer gets it treated.
[5]So I have to first convince Dr. Wilson that
[6]his mother has cancer, and then I'm providing him with
[7]pictures that he'll be able to show another doctor that
[8]this is probably cancer.
[9]So I remember making pictures for him, and I
[10]remember showing him the pictures in 2016 and that it
[11]had increased in size since 2015. I seem to remember
[12]that. That is in my memory, and my memory may be
[13]flawed. I'm going on my memory, but I remember giving
[14]it to him. I don't remember marking up these images at
[15]all, although I may have. It's not unusual for me to
[16]do.
[17]Q You did a brain MRI review on Mrs. Wilson at
[18]SimonMed, right?
[19]A I don't recall that.
[20]Q Do you remember that?
[21]A No, not at all.
[22]Q There is a report, and it appears you were
[23]looking for metastasis, and it was negative, so you
[24]don't even remember doing any of that?
[25]A Yeah. I have not looked at anything in the
[1]SimonMed system in accordance with this rule, so I don't
[2]remember it, which means I answered one of your
[3]questions wrong earlier -- I was asked -- where I was
[4]asked if I had reviewed any other studies. Well,
[5]clearly I have if you are saying that exists, but I
[6]don't recall it because I see 20,000 studies a year.
[7]Q You just don't have any recollection as you
[8]sit here today about that brain MRI, the review or your
[9]interpretation, right?
[10]A Yes. To be clear, this lawsuit is something
[11]that I wanted to avoid, so I would not have been
[12]remembering these things.
[13]Q Talk a little bit about the measurements on
[14]the 2016 MRI. As I understood it -- do you need to take
[15]that?
[16]A No.
[17]Q As I understood it, your memory is --
[18]A Please.
[19]Q -- your memory is that the mass in the right
[20]outer breast on the 2016 breast MRI was four or five
[21]centimeters. You don't have a specific recollection to
[22]size, right?
[23]A That's right, and I may be completely off.
[24]Q Have you seen Dr. Torres' final report
[25]recently?
[1]A No.
[2]Q She has a measurement on the final report for
[3]the June 2016 MRI that shows 3.5 by 3 centimeters. Do
[4]you believe that to be consistent with your measurements
[5]back when you reviewed it?
[6]A I don't recall. I wouldn't agree with
[7]anything in Dr. Torres' report.
[8]Q Let me try to approach it another way. You
[9]mentioned for us something that you believe to have been
[10]in the draft report. You said there was a BI-RADS 2 IN
[11]the draft report.
[12]A I do recall that.
[13]Q And you seem to remember that there was
[14]something about granulomatous tissue, right?
[15]A I remember that she had had identified the
[16]lesion as granulomatous tissue, which is a misdiagnosis,
[17]which is why I remember it.
[18]Q Specifically do you remember if she identified
[19]the mass near the right axilla? Can we communicate by
[20]saying near the right axilla since you said outer
[21]breast?
[22]A I'm okay with calling it axilla, if that's
[23]what I called it in a previous conversation.
[24]Q Do you remember if she had referred to the
[25]right axilla in a preliminary report as the
[1]granulomatous tissue versus some other tissue such as in
[2]the left breast?
[3]A Well, it's my recollection that she was
[4]describing this lesion in the right breast as being
[5]granulomatous tissue and that it was unchanged. And in
[6]my recollection she had a description of the left
[7]breast. She then said left breast BI-RADS 2, and then
[8]she had a description of the granulomatous tissue after
[9]she gave the BI-RADS description. And then she said it
[10]was unchanged from the previous study in 2015, and then
[11]she did not give a BI-RADS for the right breast, so --
[12]but she also did include in there that she felt it was
[13]benign and unchanged, but it should be biopsied anyway.
[14]Q So this is -- this is the part I'm trying to
[15]dissect, everything you can remember about the
[16]preliminary report. We had nailed down BI-RADS 2 left
[17]breast --
[18]A Oh, in the preliminary report it did not
[19]mention the biopsy.
[20]Q Well, let's take it step by step, and we can
[21]try to ferret it out. Left breast she said BI-RADS 2 in
[22]the preliminary report, right?
[23]A She did do that.
[24]Q You recall in the preliminary report she
[25]referenced the right mass as being granulomatous tissue
[1]and unchanged from 2015?
[2]A Correct.
[3]Q And you remember her not commenting on the
[4]right breast or axilla BI-RADS category, right?
[5]A That's correct.
[6]Q Anything else you can remember about the
[7]preliminary report that you believe you saw?
[8]A That's it.
[9]Q And you made a reference just a moment ago
[10]that now you know the final report to have recommended a
[11]biopsy, right?
[12]A Yes, I remember the final report was identical
[13]to the preliminary report with the addition of that
[14]line, which did not make sense to me because you can't
[15]recommend a biopsy on a BI-RADS 2. If you are
[16]recommending a biopsy, you are automatically at a
[17]BI-RADS 4. You don't biopsy BI-RADS 1, 2 and 3. That
[18]is improper.
[19]So she should have elevated this to a BI-RADS
[20]4, and she didn't elevate it a BI-RADS 4. She kept it
[21]at left breast BI-RADS 2, no description of the right
[22]breast whatsoever, so that in itself is negligence. I
[23]mean, it's a gap, and she did not even give it a BI-RADS
[24]category. And then she said it was benign, but do a
[25]biopsy.
[1]In radiology in mammography lesions are either
[2]normal, meaning you do nothing, benign, meaning you do
[3]nothing, probably benign, which means you follow it for
[4]another six months, or suspicious, in which case you
[5]biopsy it, or they're highly suspicious, in which case
[6]you biopsy.
[7]So category four and five are dealt with the
[8]same. Category one and two are dealt with the same.
[9]Category three is the only one you do the six-month
[10]follow-up. She gave this a recommendation that is a
[11]suspicious recommendation without a BI-RADS category.
[12]Q Let me back up and make sure --
[13]A I'm sorry. That is a complex question.
[14]Q I think my questions are fairly simple, and I
[15]think if we just take it --
[16]A I'm sorry.
[17]Q -- in a stair step manner we can get through
[18]this a lot quicker.
[19]A I'm --
[20]Q So I think I heard you say the preliminary
[21]report and the final report to your memory are exactly
[22]the same except for the recommendation for biopsy,
[23]correct?
[24]A That's correct.
[25]Q So your memory, if we take everything that is
[1]in the final report and delete the recommendation for
[2]biopsy or histological evaluation, we should have what
[3]is in the preliminary report?
[4]A That's correct.
[5]Q Then you made a reference to negligence and
[6]not making a BI-RADS evaluation or how would you say --
[7]BI-RADS what? When you say you need to make a BI-RADS
[8]determination for the right breast?
[9]A Well, let me make this clear so it makes
[10]sense. According to the MQSA, which is the federal law
[11]on how to interpret breasts, you have to give your
[12]examination a BI-RADS category at the end.
[13]Now, me personally, I don't separate the left
[14]breast and the right breast. I give one category for
[15]the entire exam, but it's okay to give a separate
[16]interpretation for each breast if you choose to do.
[17]So she gave an interpretation for the left
[18]breast a BI-RADS 2. She did not give any category for
[19]5, which is a requirement by federal law to give a
[20]BI-RADS category for that right breast. She did not do
[21]it at all. I presume that she did that -- I don't know
[22]why she did not do it. She may not do it when people
[23]have had mastectomies.
[24]But the problem is people who have had
[25]mastectomies can get recurrent breast cancer after
[1]mastectomy. Just because you had the breast cut off
[2]does not mean you can't get another breast cancer.
[3]Q Doesn't the MQSA only apply to mammography?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q Not MRIs?
[6]A That's correct. And so with the MRI she is
[7]clear on that, but clearly she gave -- she clearly gave
[8]a BI-RADS category that was misleading by giving it a 2.
[9]Q Let me -- maybe -- do you plan on attending
[10]trial and criticizing Dr. Torres as relates to standard
[11]of care?
[12]A Actually I asked not to. I was asked not
[13]to -- excuse me -- I asked not to. However, I did not
[14]want to be at this deposition either, so if I'm called
[15]to come in, I'm going to come in in accordance with the
[16]subpoena, if I'm subpoenaed into court, but I actually
[17]had originally asked not to be involved in this case.
[18]And if I am called into court in that situation, I'm
[19]going to testify as to what the truth is. My belief is
[20]that Dr. Torres was negligent in this case.
[21]Q So let's drill down on that. So in your
[22]opinion was it negligent to have not done a BI-RADS
[23]category for the right breast or is it only because in
[24]your opinion the significance of the findings on the MRI
[25]justify a BI-RADS of 4 or 5 and therefore that should
[1]have been included?
[2]A No. There is numerous areas of negligence in
[3]here, but to answer that one question of negligence, she
[4]gave it a BI-RADS of 2 in that left breast and then did
[5]nothing with the right breast where we know she has
[6]cancer. Well, that in itself implies that there is no
[7]cancer there in the right breast, which we know she does
[8]have cancer in the right breast.
[9]Q My question is solely limited to your
[10]reference to whether or not you have to put a BI-RADS
[11]category on the right breast. Is the failure to put a
[12]BI-RADS category of any amount, the omission of it,
[13]negligent?
[14]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[15]answered.
[16]A In this case I would say it is. Not because
[17]it is required -- not because it's required but because
[18]she gave one for the left breast and did not give one
[19]for the right breast.
[20]BY MR. MORING:
[21]Q So the standard of care does not require you
[22]to put a specific BI-RADS on a breast MRI, right?
[23]A Standard of care doesn't, but once you start
[24]doing it on the left breast, you are now providing
[25]BI-RADS categories.
[1]Q I know we've talked about your review of the
[2]mass on the right axilla. We'll talk probably more
[3]about that. Other than the BI-RADS category, the mass
[4]that you've -- we've already discussed and we'll discuss
[5]further, what other negligence do you see with regard to
[6]Dr. Torres' review of the 2016 images?
[7]A For the 2016 or 2015?
[8]Q We'll talk about the '15 in a moment.
[9]A 2016 she said -- she clearly states in her
[10]report that it is unchanged. Well, this is grossly
[11]changed. I mean, you don't even have to be a
[12]radiologist to see this change. So for an attending
[13]physician to say this is unchanged is grossly negligent,
[14]and the thing that concerns me about that is that it was
[15]present in 2015.
[16]So there is -- there is a reason why a doctor
[17]might want this to be unchanged, but it's clearly
[18]obviously changed. I mean, any non-medically trained
[19]person will be able to see the images and say, wow, that
[20]is very different.
[21]Q How do you define personally negligent?
[22]A I don't know what the legal definition is, but
[23]in this case if a doctor does not demonstrate a desire
[24]to help a person when they have the ability to do so and
[25]their job is to do so and they're even informed that
[1]there is a problem with the examination and they still
[2]insist on not doing it, I would say for a radiologist
[3]that is negligent.
[4]And in this case even if she were to have
[5]signed that report, after Grant Nelson told her this was
[6]grossly changed from 2015 to 2016, she could have put an
[7]addendum on that report and called Mrs. Wilson and said,
[8]Mrs. Wilson, I made a mistake, the lesion increased in
[9]size, and I think you need this biopsy very much.
[10]And that did not happen, in fact, but the
[11]report leads you to believe there is nothing wrong with
[12]the patient, this is just benign granulomatous disease,
[13]which also to be clear, I have never seen a granuloma
[14]look like this ever in my 22-year career, part of which
[15]is owning a mammography center. I've never seen
[16]something look like that.
[17]Q The analysis though, getting back to why you
[18]made a reference to gross negligence is because she did
[19]not change her diagnosis after being called by Grant
[20]Nelson and told another radiologist disagreed with her
[21]reading, right?
[22]A Well, that is certainly one of them.
[23]Q And so any time -- in your opinion any time
[24]there is disagreement among radiologists about what a
[25]image shows, that means that a radiologist is grossly
[1]negligent?
[2]A No, that is different, and that's a
[3]mischaracterization of what happened here. What
[4]happened here is that a doctor saw something that looked
[5]like -- looked like one size in 2015 and doubled in size
[6]in 2016. It doubled in size. That is like, for
[7]example, a ping-pong ball becoming a baseball the next
[8]year -- and that is actually probably not that
[9]dissimilar to what we are talking about here -- and then
[10]that person looking at the ping pong ball and the
[11]baseball and saying those are exactly the same size, and
[12]your job is to be able to tell the difference.
[13]That is all you do as a radiologist is look
[14]for this one thing, and that is what happened in this
[15]case. That's negligent. And then somebody tells you
[16]this ping pong ball is different than this baseball, and
[17]you still insist on saying they're the same in your
[18]report, and you say it's benign even though if you're
[19]wrong in this instance, it will mean this person's life.
[20]That's negligent.
[21]So that is what happened in this case. This
[22]isn't two looking at an apple and an orange wondering
[23]which one weighs the most. This is very, very
[24]different. This is obvious, and I believe that anybody
[25]looking at these images is going to look at this and
[1]say, wow, that is obvious.
[2]Q So we talked about going back to 2016 imaging
[3]what you believe there was negligence here with
[4]Dr. Torres', needs to do a BI-RADS of the right breast
[5]because she commented on the left breast, missing the
[6]mass on the right axilla and using the term unchanged.
[7]Anything else? And then we can move.
[8]A I think that is pretty much it.
[9]Q Talking about the 2015 imaging, what do you
[10]believe was below the standard of care?
[11]A In 2015 -- this is the reason I do -- this is
[12]the reason why I didn't want to be in this lawsuit. In
[13]2015 I believe that Dr. Torres missed a solid mass in
[14]the breast that is more than a centimeter in size in a
[15]person with a known history of breast cancer, which is
[16]the highest category of suspicion of all your patients,
[17]patients with a prior history of breast cancer. And she
[18]did not even identify this as a solid mass requiring
[19]biopsy.
[20]Q Do you believe she was required to in
[21]reviewing the 2015 imaging recommend biopsy in 2015 as
[22]well?
[23]A I believe the standard of care dictates that
[24]is the case.
[25]Q Anything else with regard to the 2015?
[1]A No, that's it, and that is a simple miss that
[2]doctors can make, and that's the reason why I didn't
[3]want to be in this case because the one in 2016 turned
[4]out to not be too dangerous because we were able to get
[5]Ms. Wilson a biopsy through my intervention, through my
[6]intervention and Grant Nelson's intervention through
[7]SimonMed's intervention, quite frankly.
[8]The problem with the 2015 examination, nobody
[9]else looked at that examination. Nobody saved the day
[10]on that case, and this could have been found a year
[11]earlier, and hopefully there is no damages from that.
[12]Q But again, just to -- we can put a bow on this
[13]and move on and get out of here, the 2015 -- if you
[14]answer my questions, we'll get you through here.
[15]A I promise.
[16]Q In 2015 your evaluation of the breach in the
[17]standard of care is she missed the solid mass in the
[18]breast in a patient who had a history of breast cancer
[19]and should have recommended biopsy, right?
[20]A The rules are very simple in mammography that
[21]that should have been done.
[22]Q And then returning then to my initial thought
[23]as to the size of the mass in the right axilla on
[24]Dr. Torres' 2016 report, since we've now confirmed that
[25]the preliminary report is the same as the final report
[1]except for the recommendation for biopsy, assuming since
[2]you've not seen it, that her 2016 report says that it's
[3]a 3.5 by 3 centimeter mass on the right axilla, do you
[4]disagree with that size determination?
[5]A Well, I can't tell you if I agree or disagree
[6]because I don't have the images in front of me. What I
[7]can tell you is I disagree with her assessment that it's
[8]unchanged.
[9]Q We've covered that. Thank you. I think you
[10]were asked this generally, but I want to make sure we're
[11]communicating. You have not seen any follow-up imaging
[12]of Mrs. Wilson's breasts, 2017, 2018, 2019, correct?
[13]A Not to my knowledge.
[14]Q And you've not received any or reviewed any
[15]imaging related to any spinal metastasis, liver
[16]metastasis, nothing like that, right?
[17]A Not to my knowledge, and I don't recall seeing
[18]a brain MRI, so I can't even tell you what I saw on it,
[19]but I would imagine if I saw metastatic disease on it, I
[20]would remember because I would have called Dr. Wilson at
[21]that point.
[22]Q I want to make sure we've covered all of the
[23]conversations with Grant Nelson as I kind of categorized
[24]them when you've been talking to Ms. Flanagan. It was a
[25]couple on the day or within a few days of June 30, what
[1]we've determined from the audit trail, and then perhaps
[2]one where you guys were seeing each other, maybe he came
[3]over and dropped something off and you looked at it then
[4]and there?
[5]A I don't know if --
[6]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates his
[7]testimony and compound.
[8]A I don't know that that event occurred. Let me
[9]tell you my extent involving Grant Nelson. Grant Nelson
[10]is the head of SimonMed's operation here in Florida. I
[11]saw that one of the doctors had done what I considered
[12]to be missing a breast cancer. So my next phone call
[13]was to have Grant Nelson to get her to fix her report.
[14]That would have been the first thing I --
[15]BY MR. MORING:
[16]Q And let me maybe cut this off. I do not, do
[17]not, do not want to stop you from saying whatever you
[18]need to say. My goal in asking this question is to make
[19]sure there aren't any other conversations we have not
[20]talked about. I don't need you to retell them.
[21]A There could have been as many as ten
[22]conversations regarding this. I just can't recall how
[23]many conversations I had with Grant, and I don't know
[24]that Grant was here or not. What I'm saying is that
[25]would not be unusual for Grant to come to my office, and
[1]it would not have been unusual for Grant to come to my
[2]office and say, do you mind if I take a look and see
[3]what this thing is that theoretically Dr. Torres missed
[4]because in his mind he is not a doctor. He does not
[5]understand these things.
[6]So I could have shown it to him. I probably
[7]would have shown it to him at some point, I'm thinking,
[8]because usually when a doctor has a gross miss like
[9]this, somebody wants to see it to know that they have
[10]confidence. In other words, they need to have
[11]confidence in my determination in being able to
[12]identify, and clearly I was right because it turned out
[13]to be cancer.
[14]Q Returning back to my question, have we covered
[15]all your conversations with Dr. -- with Grant Nelson,
[16]right, about Ms. Wilson's --
[17]A Generally so, yes, sir.
[18]Q Well, and I want to be fair to you, but I have
[19]to be fair to myself. I don't want to be caught at
[20]trial. There is nothing else we have not talked about?
[21]When you use generally so, I want to make sure I've
[22]heard everything.
[23]A I have no intention of --
[24]Q I wasn't intimating that you would.
[25]A If I were to come up with something that I
[1]remembered, I would make sure that you were both
[2]notified through this probably through Mr. Wilson
[3]because I don't even have conversations with your
[4]attorneys.
[5]Q That's going to be a challenge for us to get
[6]notified by Dr. Wilson.
[7]A I get it. I would tell him that it's very
[8]important that you do so or else there would be
[9]problems. In other words, I would explain to him the
[10]implication because I do understand the implication.
[11]Q In terms of Grant Nelson's current practice,
[12]he is no longer with SimonMed?
[13]A That's correct. I know that he is no longer
[14]with SimonMed, and Dr. Torres is no longer with
[15]SimonMed, and I know that Jeime Bare is no longer with
[16]SimonMed, and I believe that Alfredo Pena is not with
[17]SimonMed.
[18]Q Do you know where Grant Nelson currently is?
[19]A I don't. I don't know where he is, but I do
[20]talk to him from time to time.
[21]Q Whatever he is doing now, is it resulting in
[22]you reading any MRIs or -- excuse me -- reading any
[23]radiology imaging for his current group?
[24]A I don't know that he is with a current group,
[25]but I do know that I do read radiology studies for
[1]various different places around the region, and he may
[2]be involved in that or not. I don't know.
[3]Q I know we've talked briefly that you have not
[4]spoken to any of Mrs. Wilson's treating physicians,
[5]right?
[6]A That's correct.
[7]Q Were you involved in recommending any treating
[8]physicians for Mrs. Wilson?
[9]A No, sir.
[10]Q I don't think -- I think the answer is already
[11]no. You don't have any training in oncology, right?
[12]A Right. I do not.
[13]Q Again, if you were called to trial, no
[14]opinions on any of the oncology issues?
[15]A That's correct. I really only have opinions
[16]on the radiology studies we discussed today.
[17]Q You mentioned that you went into the SimonMed
[18]system multiple times without Jerrod Wilson specifically
[19]asking, correct?
[20]A I did it for myself and for my own
[21]edification.
[22]Q Did you get additional consent from Mrs.
[23]Wilson to do that?
[24]A No, sir.
[25]Q You are aware that consents to access records
[1]can expire, right?
[2]A I didn't even consider it.
[3]Q You've not seen a consent that has in there
[4]that it's for a limited period of time?
[5]A No, sir, but I think if I went to Ms. Wilson,
[6]she would probably be happy to do whatever I asked her
[7]to do.
[8]Q I do appreciate your thoughts on that, but in
[9]turning to my question, were you aware of there being
[10]consents that are limited in time to access someone's
[11]medical records?
[12]A No, I'm not.
[13]Q Not aware of that? You have not seen that?
[14]In all your time doing this work, you've never seen any
[15]records where there is a limited consent or limited
[16]waiver of any HIPAA privilege?
[17]A Correct, I have never seen that.
[18]Q You are not aware that those are routinely at
[19]the outset of litigation, for example, the pre-suit
[20]period or anything like that?
[21]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misleading,
[22]improper predicate.
[23]A I have seen HIPAA, and I have seen lawsuits
[24]that have gone on for 15 years, but I've never seen
[25]recreations of HIPAA releases that need to be redone
[1]during that 15-year period, so in my experience I just
[2]have not seen it.
[3]BY MR. MORING:
[4]Q Would it trouble you at all in obtaining your
[5]initial consent on the phone with Dr. Wilson and a woman
[6]who spoke Spanish reporting to be Mrs. Wilson that she
[7]speaks English fluently?
[8]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[9]A No, it doesn't --
[10]MS. HENRY: Wait, wait, wait. Object to the
[11]form, lack of predicate, harassing. I think we're
[12]getting a little bit inappropriate here, and I'll
[13]put on the record that Mrs. Wilson has consent for
[14]Dr. Mahan to access her medical records.
[15]MR. MORING: This is not even part of this
[16]deposition.
[17]MS. HENRY: I think what you are doing is
[18]improper.
[19]MR. MORING: I don't care. This is -- you
[20]don't -- this is not an objection, Sharon. This is
[21]not an objection.
[22]MS. HENRY: Well, go ahead. I think what you
[23]are doing is improper.
[24]MR. MORING: I appreciate and I do respect
[25]your feelings, but this is not an objection.
[1]MS. HENRY: Well, go -- if -- you don't have
[2]to agree or disagree with my comments on the
[3]record, so please continue with your questions.
[4]BY MR. MORING:
[5]Q Doctor, have -- you have not seen
[6]Mrs. Wilson's deposition, right?
[7]A No, I haven't.
[8]Q The fact she was able to give, let's see, a
[9]three and a half hour deposition without an interpreter,
[10]that would indicate to you she certainly understands
[11]English, right?
[12]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, misstates
[13]testimony, improper predicate, harassing and
[14]improper. Go ahead.
[15]A Well, I am presuming that the deposition was
[16]in English when you say that because you did not --
[17]BY MR. MORING:
[18]Q Correct.
[19]A -- say it was in English, but when I was on
[20]the phone with Ms. Wilson, Jerrod immediately started
[21]Spanish to her, and maybe he was just translating what I
[22]was saying, and I'm not sure if he was translating it
[23]because she did not understand what I was saying or he
[24]was trying to explain it a different way.
[25]I would say it's probably unlikely that he was
[1]misrepresenting what I was saying since she -- if she
[2]could speak English. She could hear me, but I guess he
[3]was asking her and probably describing to her the need
[4]for consent. And they probably did it in Spanish.
[5]Like I said, I don't know because I don't
[6]speak Spanish, and I presumed he was doing it because
[7]she could not speak English. Well, the fact that she
[8]can speak English fluently does surprise me, but I only
[9]had that one conversation with her, and I had it through
[10]her son. So that is why I made that conclusion, and
[11]clearly it was a false conclusion.
[12]Q Do you have any texts at all with Jerrod
[13]Wilson?
[14]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[15]answered.
[16]A I don't think I would have text -- I don't
[17]really speak with Jerrod on a regular basis.
[18]BY MR. MORING:
[19]Q Have you -- again, this is going back to the
[20]predicate -- have you done any investigation, looked in
[21]your phone to see if you have his number, if you
[22]exchanged any texts with him?
[23]A No, I have not.
[24]Q Do you have his number?
[25]A I can check that. I don't see his number in
[1]my book, but I -- you know, I would not have been
[2]calling him. He would have been calling me.
[3]Q What is the name of your employee -- forgive
[4]me if that is not the correct term -- who you said is
[5]friends with him?
[6]A Her name is Yamira, Yamira, Rodriguez,
[7]and I just don't have a recollection of how I
[8]communicated with Dr. Wilson. I just don't.
[9]Q This is a clarification that I think was
[10]through a variety of us using Mr. Wilson and Dr. Wilson
[11]interchangeably. When you -- throughout this deposition
[12]when you used the term Mr. Wilson, were you referring to
[13]Jerrod Wilson, the chiropractor?
[14]A Yes, and also Mr. Wilson and Dr. Wilson. I
[15]may have used them interchangeably. I'm referring to
[16]the same person.
[17]Q You have not spoken to Gary Wilson, Myriam
[18]Wilson's husband?
[19]A That's correct. I don't even know of his
[20]existence. Jerrod has never told me about his father,
[21]which is kind of my -- that kind of explains how close
[22]my relationship is with Jerrod Wilson. I don't even
[23]know that he has a father. I mean, I presume he had a
[24]father at some point because he exists, but I don't know
[25]his father is alive.
[1]Q I think that is a fair assumption. Have we
[2]covered all of your conversations with Jerrod Wilson?
[3]A Yes, sir.
[4]Q You mentioned a couple of things about the
[5]Isleworth Country Club I want to go back to with
[6]Dr. Torres. You said you had one conversation with her,
[7]and she said -- correct me if I'm wrong, just what I
[8]wrote down as you were saying it -- as long as you don't
[9]read my breast imaging, we'll be okay, or something to
[10]that effect.
[11]A That's correct.
[12]Q Did you take that as a threat?
[13]A Yes, absolutely.
[14]Q Do you remember what Dr. Torres looks like at
[15]all?
[16]A Well, I didn't say she was going to physically
[17]abuse me, but doctors can cause problems with other
[18]doctors. But, yes, I do remember what she looks like
[19]vaguely.
[20]Q Diminutive in size, right? She is not
[21]physically a threat to you, right?
[22]MS. HENRY: Object to form.
[23]A She is not physically a threat. I didn't
[24]think she was going to physically attack me. I didn't
[25]think that's what she meant, and I also don't think that
[1]necessarily she was going to cause me trouble if I read
[2]breast MRIs.
[3]There was another doctor that was present that
[4]she was talking to, and they looked like they were
[5]friends. That was a doctor named Dr. Safder,
[6]Safder. Dr. Safder read a brain MRI with DTI
[7]imaging, and I told her -- and the DTI images were
[8]abnormal, and she read them as normal, so when I
[9]contacted Dr. Safder with this situation I asked her, do
[10]you know how to read DTI, and she said, no. And I said,
[11]well, why are you doing -- reading this brain MRI with a
[12]DTI image if you don't know how to read it.
[13]So at that point Dr. Safder blocked me on all
[14]the images. She blocked me with all my connections in
[15]her division at SimonMed. So here I had -- I'm now
[16]having a similar situation with Dr. Torres where you see
[17]Dr. Torres has this problem. And I don't want to create
[18]a bad situation. That is not my goal with all this.
[19]My goal was to provide patient care. I think
[20]if a patient knew that their doctor did not know how to
[21]read their scan, they would not want the doctor reading
[22]their scan.
[23]In this situation with Ms. Wilson, if
[24]Ms. Wilson knew that a doctor had misread her study and
[25]said things were unchanged for the last year, I think
[1]they would want to know. So I tried to intervene in a
[2]way that would be politically acceptable to all parties.
[3]BY MR. MORING:
[4]Q The issue with Dr. Safder, did it occur where
[5]you had the conversation with her about her brain
[6]imaging, did that occur before or after this meeting at
[7]the country club?
[8]A It would have been after.
[9]Q At the time Dr. Torres was talking with Dr.
[10]Safder, you did not have any objective reason to believe
[11]she was going to retaliate against you if you read any
[12]breast imaging, did you?
[13]A Some doctors retaliate against other doctors
[14]in many ways, so I would say yes. She could certainly
[15]have caused me plenty of trouble by being a SimonMed
[16]employee.
[17]Q So could any employee?
[18]A Correct, but other doctors did not threaten
[19]me.
[20]Q But you took that -- you took what she said as
[21]a threat?
[22]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[23]answered.
[24]A Absolutely.
[25]BY MR. MORING:
[1]Q The country club, you said folks brought you
[2]there so you could be introduced to all of the SimonMed
[3]doctors?
[4]A Correct.
[5]Q Did you pay anything to attend that?
[6]A No. It was paid for by SimonMed.
[7]Q Even though you thought this was an
[8]extravagant expense for a business meeting, you did not
[9]turn it down or try to give back any money or pay your
[10]way, right?
[11]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[12]A No. Why would I do that? That does not make
[13]sense to me. I mean, I did not hold the meeting. I
[14]didn't invite someone to my party to ask them to pay for
[15]the party. They asked me to come to this meeting.
[16]BY MR. MORING:
[17]Q Whenever you were -- you spoke at that
[18]meeting, right?
[19]A Yes, I did.
[20]Q When you spoke at that meeting, you told the
[21]doctors that you were so connected in the legal
[22]community that if they got sued, they should contact you
[23]because you could make it go away, right?
[24]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[25]A I would never have said that.
[1]MS. HENRY: Improper predicate.
[2]A I have never said that.
[3]BY MR. MORING:
[4]Q You've never announced that at meetings with
[5]radiologists?
[6]A No.
[7]Q You've never bragged to other radiologists
[8]about your connections with the legal community and your
[9]ability to talk to people to make these things go away?
[10]A Since I have been sued for malpractice, we all
[11]know that I don't have the ability to do that, to make
[12]legal cases go away, so that is not the case. So I
[13]would not be bragging to people that I can make lawsuits
[14]go away.
[15]In fact, I think the only reason someone would
[16]say that I said such a thing is to try to discredit me.
[17]As I said, I've been sued myself, so I certainly cannot
[18]make lawsuits go away.
[19]Q Board certification for breast radiology, you
[20]said you have that board certification?
[21]A My American Board of Radiology certification
[22]includes that certification.
[23]Q Is that a special certificate like
[24]neuroradiology is with the American Board of Radiology?
[25]A No, they don't have a CAQ for mammography.
[1]Q And so if we look up your qualifications, your
[2]certifications with the American Board of Radiology,
[3]it's going to say diagnostic radiology, right?
[4]A I believe so.
[5]Q So you're not going to actually have any
[6]special listing for breast radiology with the American
[7]Board of Radiology?
[8]A That's correct.
[9]Q Or any other radiology group, correct?
[10]A That's correct.
[11]Q When was this wedding at with Dr. -- when you
[12]met Dr. Wilson and began I guess speaking to him for the
[13]first time in detail?
[14]A I don't know the event, but it was prior to
[15]the 2016 MRI. I was already at that point I would say
[16]on friendly terms with Dr. Wilson, but as I said, we're
[17]not -- it's not like we're close friends.
[18]MR. MORING: All right, sir. I think those
[19]are the only questions I have for you. Thank you
[20]for your time.
[21]THE WITNESS: It's my pleasure.
[22]- - - -
[23]CROSS EXAMINATION
[24]BY MS. HENRY:
[25]Q Dr. Mahan, I just have a few follow-up
[1]questions. Do you need to take a break?
[2]A No. Let's get this over with.
[3]Q I agree. During the entirety of the
[4]questioning by Ms. Flanagan and Mr. Moring neither of
[5]them at any point showed you a copy of any of the
[6]reports prepared by Dr. Torres; is that correct?
[7]A That's correct.
[8]Q And so all of your answers today were based on
[9]your best memory several years later; is that correct?
[10]A Well, I would not say it's from several years
[11]later. I do know that I have seen these reports
[12]sometime in the recent past, recent meaning a year ago
[13]maybe. But, yes, and I have seen these reports several
[14]times, but, yes, it's all from memory.
[15]Q So for purposes of your questioning today by
[16]these two attorneys, they did not give you the report
[17]for the benefit of your responses; is that correct?
[18]A That's correct, and so my memory may be
[19]slightly flawed, but I think most of what I have said is
[20]correct.
[21]Q And there was also a reference to an audit
[22]trail, but likewise you were not provided with any copy
[23]of the audit trail from which they appeared to be basing
[24]their questions, correct?
[25]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to form, predicate.
[1]A That's correct, and what is important to know
[2]is that audit trails can be somewhat manipulated because
[3]you can go into one study and dictate for another study
[4]without looking like you ever opened up that original
[5]study.
[6]MS. FLANAGAN: Move to strike as
[7]nonresponsive.
[8]MS. HENRY: Actually, it was my question, and
[9]it was quite responsive.
[10]BY MS. HENRY:
[11]Q But to address the objection, do you recall a
[12]line of questioning by both Ms. Flanagan and Mr. Moring
[13]earlier in your deposition that referenced entries to an
[14]audit log? Do you recall that?
[15]A That's correct.
[16]Q And during -- at the time of that
[17]questioning -- strike that.
[18]Is it your recollection from your deposition
[19]today that those questions appear to be based on an
[20]audit log that they were referring to at the time they
[21]were asking you your questions?
[22]A That's correct.
[23]MS. FLANAGAN: Objection, predicate.
[24]A They were looking at an audit log while they
[25]were asking me questions.
[1]BY MS. HENRY:
[2]Q At no time during their questioning did they
[3]give you a copy of the audit log for your reference; is
[4]that true?
[5]A That's correct.
[6]Q During your deposition there has been
[7]reference to cancer in the right breast of Mrs. Wilson
[8]and also the right axilla and some discussion regarding
[9]the fact that the right upper outer breast is the
[10]axillary area. Do you recall those questions?
[11]A Yes, ma'am.
[12]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to form.
[13]MS. HENRY: What is your objection?
[14]MS. FLANAGAN: It's vague. There is no
[15]foundation.
[16]BY MS. HENRY:
[17]Q Did you understand my question, Dr. Mahan?
[18]A Yes, ma'am.
[19]Q And so is my understanding correct that when
[20]you are responding to a question saying right breast
[21]cancer, the area that we're all talking about in these
[22]questions would be the right upper breast axillary
[23]answer -- or area?
[24]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to form, predicate.
[25]MR. MORING: I think he said he could not say
[1]upper or lower. I think you meant outer? I don't
[2]mean to interrupt you, but I think that would
[3]clarify.
[4]BY MS. HENRY:
[5]Q Let me start over.
[6]MR. MORING: Sorry. I didn't mean to
[7]interrupt.
[8]MS. HENRY: Yeah, and there were some
[9]objections.
[10]BY MS. HENRY:
[11]Q Today we've been talking about cancer in
[12]Mrs. Wilson's right breast, correct?
[13]A That's correct.
[14]Q And in responding to some of the questions,
[15]some of the responses to my recollection spoke just to
[16]right breast cancer. Some responses spoke to right
[17]upper outer breast, and some responses referred to
[18]axillary area. Is that your recollection as well?
[19]A Yes, ma'am.
[20]Q And is use of all three of those terms
[21]interchangeable in this case?
[22]A Yes. Let me be clear so everyone can
[23]understand this anatomy. The outer breast is the outer
[24]50 percent of the breast, the outer 50 percent, which
[25]includes the axilla. The upper outer breast is the
[1]25 percent of the breast that is in the upper outer
[2]region, which includes the axilla. The axilla is the
[3]area of the breast that goes into the arm pit. That
[4]does not include the entire upper outer breast, but when
[5]you say -- when you say there is something in the
[6]axilla, it is by definition also in the outer breast and
[7]in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.
[8]Q Okay. Thank you. In response to some of the
[9]questions asked earlier, you indicated that your main
[10]priorities were to make sure Mrs. Wilson got a biopsy
[11]and with saving her life. Do you recall those
[12]responses?
[13]A Yes.
[14]MS. FLANAGAN: Objection, predicate.
[15]BY MS. HENRY:
[16]Q And what I want to clarify is the term saving
[17]Jerrod's mother's life, and I'm wondering what you meant
[18]by that.
[19]MS. FLANAGAN: Objection to predicate.
[20]A What I meant is -- well, first of all, what I
[21]meant is I have no other interest in this case. I had
[22]no other interest in taking care of Ms. Wilson. I don't
[23]get paid for it. I don't have any other incentive to do
[24]anything good, and I did not seek any fame out of this.
[25]I have no personal gain out of this situation.
[1]I saw there was a woman who had a cancer. The
[2]cancer had at least been there for one year because I
[3]knew it was there in 2015, and there is a chance that
[4]cancer can spread. And once it gets -- once it spreads,
[5]the chance for this person surviving that cancer is very
[6]small.
[7]So at that point my only interest was making
[8]sure that she got into the hands of people who would be
[9]able to biopsy this, find out and prove that it was
[10]cancer because I already felt it was strongly cancer,
[11]and then would then get the care based on appropriate
[12]oncologic care to try to make sure this cancer does not
[13]spread. That was my only goal in this case.
[14]BY MS. HENRY:
[15]Q And I think you've told us that you have no
[16]information one way or the other whether or not
[17]Mrs. Wilson's cancer has, in fact, spread; is that
[18]correct?
[19]A Well, in fact, not only do I not have any
[20]information on it because I didn't ask about it, but the
[21]fact this happened in 2016 and we consider that a person
[22]has to be five years out before they are cured of
[23]cancer, and now with breast cancer they even continue
[24]chemotherapy and it's now been approved for ten years
[25]after the cancer. So we won't know that she has not --
[1]she is out of the clearance for metastatic disease for
[2]another two years.
[3]Q So you have no information regarding her
[4]current status relative to metastatic disease; is that
[5]correct?
[6]A That is correct.
[7]Q You were asked a series of questions by
[8]Mr. Moring about BI-RADS categories and whether or not
[9]BI-RADS category determination was included in
[10]Dr. Torres' final report from her June 28, 2016 MRI
[11]interpretation. Do you recall that discussion with
[12]Mr. Moring?
[13]A Yes. I do recall it very well.
[14]Q And I want to clarify one thing because I
[15]think the testimony went back and forth just a little
[16]bit, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly.
[17]So the MQSA does not require a BI-RADS
[18]category for an MRI report?
[19]A Yes. They don't require it, but the fact it
[20]was put on there and the one that was put out there was
[21]misleading because it indicates -- it suggests she does
[22]not have a problem. That was the problem.
[23]Q So it's your opinion that once you undertake
[24]to put a BI-RADS category on an MRI, it must be done
[25]correctly?
[1]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to the form, predicate.
[2]A Well, certainly it should be done correctly.
[3]BY MS. HENRY:
[4]Q And failure to do that is a breach of the
[5]standard of care?
[6]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to the form, predicate.
[7]A That is my opinion. If you fail -- once you
[8]start telling people and leading them down the wrong
[9]direction, that is a breach of the standard of care.
[10]BY MS. HENRY:
[11]Q I'd like to ask you a few questions about your
[12]conversations with Grant Nelson because I think that
[13]testimony is -- well, strike that.
[14]I'd like to ask you some questions about your
[15]conversations with Grant Nelson regarding these events.
[16]If you could please describe for me to the best of your
[17]recollection how many times you spoke with him and when
[18]and the substance of those conversations?
[19]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to the form.
[20]A I can't tell you how many times I spoke with
[21]Grant Nelson because I used to speak with Grant Nelson
[22]up to ten times a day during that period of time. At
[23]that period of time we were aggressively working to try
[24]to get as much radiology business in the community to
[25]SimonMed.
[1]During that period of time I told Grant Nelson
[2]that Dr. Torres had missed a breast cancer on the mother
[3]of a referring physician. I offered to show Grant -- I
[4]remember offering to show him, and I remember him saying
[5]that he trusted me and he believed me. And I said,
[6]well, what do I need to do at this point, and I told him
[7]at that point that you need to speak with Dr. Torres,
[8]tell her to take a -- tell her a doctor looked at these
[9]studies; don't say it's a radiologist and don't say it's
[10]me because the SimonMed doctors had a certain element of
[11]animosity toward me. They saw me as being an invader.
[12]And the 2000 -- I told her to take a look at
[13]the 2015 study and the 2016 study because she said there
[14]was no change, and it was an obvious change. And I
[15]wanted him to make sure she looked at it and make sure
[16]that she called this a cancer and recommended a biopsy.
[17]I remember him calling me back at some point
[18]and saying that he talked to her, that she looked at the
[19]pictures. I remember him stating to me because I asked
[20]him -- it was very important to me to say that she
[21]looked at the pictures while he was there.
[22]BY MS. HENRY:
[23]Q Let me interrupt you there before we go on to
[24]the next conversation. What was Mr. Nelson's reaction
[25]when you initially contacted him and told him that
[1]Dr. Torres had misread a film regarding the mother of a
[2]referring physician?
[3]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to form.
[4]MS. HENRY: What is your objection?
[5]MS. FLANAGAN: Speculation.
[6]MR. MORING: Predicate.
[7]A At that time he was very upset because not
[8]only -- not only do we not like it when a doctor has a
[9]miss, but in this case it's a significant miss, and in
[10]this case it was potentially a miss from 2015, which is
[11]a year prior, which is a significant miss.
[12]BY MS. HENRY:
[13]Q And what is it that Mr. Nelson said to you
[14]that let you -- led to your belief that he was upset?
[15]Obviously you're not in his mind.
[16]A Mr. Nelson had a very -- he had a -- very easy
[17]way to tell when he was upset because he has a very
[18]old-fashioned term that he used, and he goes, oh dear.
[19]In other words, it's very easy, and I remember him
[20]saying that in that conversation, oh, dear, which is his
[21]way of saying that he is not happy, and he is unhappy
[22]about something he has no control over. However, we did
[23]have some control in getting the situation controlled at
[24]the time.
[25]Q Tell me about the next conversation you recall
[1]with Mr. Nelson.
[2]A I remember really being upset myself and
[3]saying we need to get Dr. Torres to make sure she puts
[4]in her report that this is a cancer, and then I
[5]remember -- and I remember talking about this. I kind
[6]of reverberated over it several times because -- which
[7]I'm talking to the wrong person, but I remember him
[8]saying that he would go back and talk to her.
[9]And then I remember seeing the final report
[10]which said there was a biopsy there, and I saw the final
[11]report, and then I remember him contacting me after I
[12]saw the report telling me she agreed to put into the
[13]report to do a biopsy. And at that point I told him I
[14]saw it, and I said that's -- we'll have to accept that;
[15]that's going to have to be good enough.
[16]Q Did you ask Mr. Nelson why Dr. Torres was less
[17]than willingly agreeing to change her report?
[18]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to form, predicate.
[19]A I did not have to ask because I already knew.
[20]BY MS. HENRY:
[21]Q What is that reason?
[22]MR. MORING: Speculation.
[23]MS. FLANAGAN: Objection, predicate.
[24]A It was because she had missed the case in
[25]2015, and she would not want to admit she missed it from
[1]a year ago.
[2]BY MS. HENRY:
[3]Q Have you had other experiences with Dr. Torres
[4]misreading a radiology study?
[5]A No, but I've had many experiences with doctors
[6]making mistakes, and that's what they do. Instead of
[7]admitting they make a mistake, they do something to try
[8]to cover it up as their initial response. I should not
[9]say all doctors do it, but it is a typical response,
[10]typical response that usually occurs from arrogance
[11]thinking you can't make a mistake. I've seen it happen
[12]many times. It's usually the major downfall for
[13]doctors, and in this case it's a very obvious situation.
[14]MS. FLANAGAN: Move to strike, non-responsive.
[15]BY MS. HENRY:
[16]Q Do you know where Dr. Torres is working
[17]currently?
[18]A No, I do not. I only know that her contract
[19]was not renewed by SimonMed.
[20]Q Do you know why?
[21]A I only --
[22]MR. MORARIS: Predicate, calls for
[23]speculation.
[24]MS. FLANAGAN: Hold on a second. I have
[25]concerns whether he knows something that is
[1]proprietary or that is not something that should be
[2]disseminated, so I'm going to caution you, Dr.
[3]Mahan, that if you know something proprietary that
[4]you ought to consider whether or not you should be
[5]disclosing that.
[6]A I would not disclose anything proprietary, and
[7]I appreciate the warning, but I only know that she --
[8]her contract was not renewed, and that's all I know.
[9]BY MS. HENRY:
[10]Q Okay. Do you know the reason it was not
[11]renewed?
[12]MS. FLANAGAN: Objection to predicate.
[13]MR. MORING: Speculation.
[14]A As I said, I only know her contract was not
[15]renewed. I have no idea why, but I have always had a
[16]very good relationship with SimonMed, and I have known
[17]they have taken great caution to keep a good standard of
[18]care among their physicians, and I have seen them not
[19]renew contracts with other physicians as well.
[20]BY MS. HENRY:
[21]Q Do you do the hiring -- are you in charge of
[22]hiring radiologists at EliteRAD?
[23]A Yes, ma'am.
[24]Q Would you hire Dr. Torres if she applied for a
[25]job as a radiologist at EliteRAD?
[1]MR. MORING: Predicate.
[2]MS. FLANAGAN: Same objection.
[3]A No.
[4]BY MS. HENRY:
[5]Q Why is that?
[6]MS. FLANAGAN: Same objection.
[7]A The biggest thing I look for in doctors when
[8]I'm hiring them is issues with arrogance, and I try to
[9]avoid problems with arrogance because of my own problems
[10]with my own arrogance. So I know arrogance gets me into
[11]trouble, and I see how arrogance gets other doctors into
[12]trouble. So I try to keep my own situation toned down,
[13]and I try to surround myself with people who can help me
[14]with that.
[15]BY MS. HENRY:
[16]Q And Dr. Torres does not fit that description
[17]in your opinion?
[18]MS. FLANAGAN: Objection, predicate.
[19]MR. MORING: Same objection.
[20]A The time that I met Dr. Torres and she warned
[21]me to not read her studies was a big sign for me that
[22]there was an issue, and then the way she dealt with this
[23]problem, this one problem right here, was particularly
[24]problematic because it could have cost someone their
[25]life, so absolutely. That is a huge problem. As a
[1]physician, I can tell you that is a major problem that I
[2]have.
[3]MS. HENRY: Okay. Let's take just a quick
[4]break. I'm going to review my notes. I think I'm
[5]just about done.
[6]A I would like to answer one of your questions
[7]differently. When you said -- earlier I was asked if I
[8]had anything that I should know and let you know if
[9]there is something before I spring it up so -- if
[10]something was not sprung up to you at a later time.
[11]It's very important that I -- that you know
[12]something about how these audit trails work. When you
[13]get an audit trail, it will show you who accessed the
[14]case. It will show you when a study was -- images were
[15]exported, as you saw, but what it might not tell you is
[16]when the study was actually dictated because you can
[17]dictate multiple studies at the same time. And
[18]radiologists will often do that when we have multiple
[19]studies on the same patient.
[20]So, for example, if I have a chest x-ray and a
[21]spine x-ray and a foot x-ray on the same patient, I can
[22]access just the chest x-ray and dictate all three of
[23]those studies because I can access the images at the
[24]same time.
[25]All three of those reports will then be typed
[1]by a typist on the separate report. So you can take a
[2]look and see when the typist types the report. That
[3]will tell you when the preliminary report was done on
[4]the study, just so that is clear. It's not the
[5]radiologist that you need to be looking for. It's the
[6]typist.
[7]MS. HENRY: Let's go off the record and take a
[8]break.
[9](Recess from 5:26 p.m. to 5:38 p.m.)
[10]MS. HENRY: I have no further questions.
[11]MS. FLANAGAN: We're not done.

[13]REDIRECT EXAMINATION
[14]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[15]Q All right. So Dr. Mahan, it's your opinion
[16]that Ms. Wilson had right breast cancer in 2015 based on
[17]your review of her right breast MRI, correct?
[18]A It is my opinion that Ms. Wilson on the 2015
[19]MRI had a finding that is suspicious for cancer, and
[20]based on looking at the 2016 MRI, I can say that it
[21]was -- yes, that is true, but I need to have the 2016 to
[22]say that.
[23]Q You're not in any position today based on your
[24]review of her imaging to say that she had any suspicious
[25]findings -- strike that.
[1]You can't say the earliest point in time when
[2]Myriam Wilson had suspicious findings in her right
[3]breast before May 28, 2015 that were suggestive of or
[4]consistent with right breast cancer, correct?
[5]A Well, I know she had a right breast cancer at
[6]some point because she had a mastectomy, but I did not
[7]see any images to suggest she had that prior to 2015.
[8]Q So when she developed right breast cancer,
[9]recurrent right breast cancer before May 29, 2015, you
[10]can't say because you have not seen images prior to that
[11]enabling you to make that determination, correct?
[12]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[13]predicate.
[14]A That's correct.
[15]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[16]Q In terms of your issue with Dr. Torres' June
[17]28 -- strike that -- June 30, 2016 breast MRI report for
[18]the June 28 study, you told Jerrod Wilson that day that
[19]you had thought his mother had suspicious findings in
[20]her right breast that could be cancer and she needed to
[21]have a biopsy, correct?
[22]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, asked and
[23]answered.
[24]A That's to the best of my recollection. It
[25]could have been -- it could have been after Grant Nelson
[1]had gotten Dr. Torres to change the report. And it
[2]could have been before. I don't know. I can't recall
[3]exactly the exact string of events as those tied into
[4]one another.
[5]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[6]Q But you made sure on June 30, 2016 that Jerrod
[7]Wilson knew your opinion that his mother needed a biopsy
[8]in her right breast based upon your review of her 2016
[9]imaging on June 30, 2016, correct?
[10]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[11]predicate, asked and answered.
[12]A That's correct.
[13]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[14]Q And so based on your communications with
[15]Jerrod Wilson on June 30, 2016, you made sure that
[16]Jerrod Wilson knew that his mother ought to have a
[17]biopsy, and he ought to advocate for her having a biopsy
[18]of her right breast based upon your review regardless of
[19]what Dr. Torres' final MRI interpretation or report
[20]looked like, right?
[21]MS. HENRY: Object to the form, improper
[22]predicate, compound, vague and ambiguous. Go
[23]ahead.
[24]A That would have been what I said, but since I
[25]don't have the official report, I would not have been
[1]able to enact this to occur. However, I would have told
[2]him, and I would have impressed on him to make sure his
[3]mother got a biopsy, and I would have pursued this had I
[4]thought there was any trouble with her getting a biopsy.
[5]BY MS. FLANAGAN:
[6]Q And you had no reason to pursue it because you
[7]were not told she had any trouble getting a biopsy of
[8]her right breast after June 30, 2016, correct?
[9]A Well, actually I did follow this, and I found
[10]out she did -- she was scheduled for a biopsy, and I
[11]followed it and found out that the biopsy was positive,
[12]so I knew that she had gotten her proper care.
[13]MS. FLANAGAN: I think that is all I have.
[14]- - - -
[15]RECROSS EXAMINATION
[16]BY MR. MORING:
[17]Q Two more follow-ups -- I apologize -- to make
[18]sure I got everything done. You made a couple of
[19]references to some issues with the audit trail. I think
[20]you previously testified you have not actually seen the
[21]audit trail.
[22]A Correct. I would have to see it to be able to
[23]analyze it. I have not seen it.
[24]Q Sitting here today, you don't have any
[25]opinions as to the audit trail, right?
[1]A That's correct.
[2]Q Plaintiffs' counsel asked you if we had shown
[3]you any of the reports, I think the images, as well as
[4]the audit trail, and you said no, we had not shown you
[5]that, right?
[6]A That's correct. I'm testifying on my memory
[7]and what I've seen, so I have not seen the audit trail.
[8]Q Just to clarify, Plaintiffs' counsel in her 30
[9]minutes or so of questioning did not show you any of
[10]those things either, right?
[11]MS. HENRY: Object to the form.
[12]A Yes, that is correct.
[13]BY MR. MORING:
[14]Q We just needed to put it on the record so
[15]there is no confusion later.
[16]A I still have not seen those things.
[17]Q Have we covered all of your opinions, Doctor?
[18]MS. HENRY: Object to the form of the
[19]question.
[20]A Well, I would not say we have covered all my
[21]opinions because if you asked me questions that -- I
[22]can't foresee a question that I have not been asked yet,
[23]and I may have an opinion on that, but based on my major
[24]opinions on this case, I would say that I have -- I have
[25]at some point expressed my opinions, yes.
[1]BY MR. MORING:
[2]Q In this deposition?
[3]A In this deposition, yes.
[4]MR. MORING: Thank you, sir. I don't have any
[5]further questions.

[7]FURTHER RECROSS EXAMINATION
[8]BY MS. HENRY:
[9]Q Dr. Mahan, I'm going to hand you a copy of the
[10]final report for the June 28, 2016 MRI of Myriam Wilson
[11]and I'll also attach that as Plaintiffs' Exhibit Number
[12]1, and, sir, I'll ask you to take a few minutes and
[13]review this document. And based on your review, let us
[14]know if you would like to make any changes to your
[15]testimony today.
[16]MR. MORING: Just while he is reviewing that,
[17]for purposes of the transcript, I would object
[18]because I don't think there is a right to recross,
[19]but certainly for deposition, discovery purposes,
[20]have at it --
[21]MS. FLANAGAN: Join. I'll object to the
[22]predicate.
[23]MR. MORING: -- if it's ever read to the jury.
[24]A I have reviewed it.
[25]BY MS. HENRY:
[1]Q Based on your review, does that review refresh
[2]your recollection in any way that would make you want to
[3]change any of your testimony today or any of your
[4]opinions?
[5]MS. FLANAGAN: Object to the form, predicate.
[6]MR. MORING: Join.
[7]A Well, the only thing I would add on here is
[8]that I didn't recall some of the things that were said.
[9]Most of this is exactly as I said in my memory. It's --
[10]first impression does have the BI-RADS category 2.
[11]There is no BI-RADS category for the right breast.
[12]However, it does -- at the end of the report it has a
[13]section of BI-RADS pathology, addendum report made when
[14]the pathology was available and that follow-up was not
[15]done.
[16]In other words, there was no addendum done on
[17]this report, and we do know that there is pathology
[18]there because we know it turned out to be cancer. I
[19]don't know what that means. It is certainly not a
[20]requirement. However, I have such significant problems
[21]with impression number two. I can't even begin -- I
[22]don't even know where to begin with that impression.
[23]BY MS. HENRY:
[24]Q I know you just told me you don't know where
[25]to begin, but if you could, please, sir, describe your
[1]problems that you have with impression number two to the
[2]best of your ability.
[3]A Well, let me go ahead and start with the --
[4]sentence by sentence and how each -- how wrong this
[5]observation is. Number two, it starts by saying: The
[6]right axilla demonstrates multiple axillary lymph nodes,
[7]which is a bilateral symmetric stable finding.
[8]Well, first of all, bilateral means it's in
[9]both the right and left breast, and this thing that is
[10]in the right breast is not in the left breast. So it is
[11]not bilateral. It is not symmetric, and because it was
[12]present on the previous study and it has increased in
[13]size, it is not stable.
[14]She then says, there is a dominant lymph node
[15]in the right axilla that measures 3.5 by 3 centimeters,
[16]however, demonstrates normal architecture and a normal
[17]fatty hilum suggestive of a reactive lymph node.
[18]Well, first of all, a lymph node that is 3.5
[19]centimeters you should be thinking that is cancer, and
[20]even if it's not breast cancer, it could be lymphoma
[21]once it gets to that size. So this could have been
[22]something that is not even breast cancer. It could have
[23]been something entirely different.
[24]Secondly, she said there is a fatty hilum.
[25]That is a finding that indicates that this is a benign
[1]lymph node. That is a known radiographic finding that
[2]suggests this is benign. There is no normal fatty hilum
[3]in this cancer because it's not a normal lymph node.
[4]The next sentence says -- so in other words,
[5]she is directing everything toward being benign. She
[6]then says the signal suggests the possibility of a
[7]silicone granuloma/benign reactive lymph node. Well,
[8]the signal findings indicate it's cancer. It rapidly
[9]enhances, and it brightly enhances, and it's solid.
[10]That is what the signal shows. So this is everything
[11]that is not a silicone granuloma or a benign reactive
[12]lymph node.
[13]She then says in the next sentence: The fact
[14]that there are multiple bilateral similar lymph nodes
[15]present suggests this represents a benign geology such
[16]as a reactive inflammatory etiology rather than a
[17]neoplastic origin. Neoplastic means cancer, so she is
[18]saying that this is benign rather than cancer because
[19]it's bilateral and there are similar lymph nodes. There
[20]are no similar lymph nodes. Even if this is a
[21]metastatic lymph node, there is nothing else like this
[22]in her breast.
[23]She keeps implying that it's on both breasts.
[24]It's bilateral. This is the second time she says that.
[25]Then she says: However, due to the size, histologic
[1]diagnosis is recommend for confirmation. And thank
[2]goodness she put that in there. In other words, because
[3]it's so big, let's go ahead and get some tissue out of
[4]this.
[5]She then states that the case has been
[6]discussed with additional breast radiologists achieving
[7]final consensus, which I thought that was kind of
[8]unusual too because I don't see that on the other
[9]SimonMed studies, and she does not mention who the
[10]additional radiologist is. For example, at EliteRAD
[11]when we have two radiologists reviewing a case, we
[12]always put the doctor's name in. So there is an
[13]unknown, nameless doctor out there who supposedly is
[14]consenting and agreeing with her.
[15]So I have significant issues with this entire
[16]section of this report. This is -- in other words,
[17]there is nothing in that part of the report that says
[18]it's benign, and yet she is implying it's benign the
[19]entire report, but at least she recommended biopsy.
[20]Then she ends this by saying the case was
[21]discussed with the referring physician, Dr. Smith
[22]Gonzales, at the time of the dictation. The reason you
[23]call a referring physician is because you're worried
[24]that a person has something wrong with them.
[25]Fortunately, in this case she did call
[1]Dr. Gonzales to tell him to biopsy this patient. So
[2]that is the one very good thing she did in this case,
[3]but when she put that in there -- you call doctors up --
[4]there is a reason why you call a referring physician.
[5]You don't call a referring physician for every study.
[6]You call them if your patient has breast
[7]cancer. You call them if the patient has something that
[8]nobody was expecting like let's say there was a
[9]completely separate lesion in here that nobody expected
[10]her to have. That is a reason for a phone call, and
[11]then sometimes call people if we see somebody who has
[12]something life-threatening. Those are really the
[13]instances that we call a referring physician.
[14]And in this case she clearly called the
[15]physician because she saw something that was of concern,
[16]but she did not document it in the report, which -- in
[17]fact, she documented things that were just not correct.
[18]Q Thank you.

[20]BY MS. HENRY:
[21]Q Dr. Mahan, I'm going to hand you Dr. Torres'
[22]report for the May 29, 2015 MRI of Myriam Wilson and ask
[23]you to review that.
[24]MS. HENRY: And we'll mark that as Plaintiff's
[25]Exhibit Number 2.
[1](Plaintiff's 2 marked.)
[2]A Yes, I've read that.
[3]BY MS. HENRY:
[4]Q Based on your review of the 2015 MRI, do you
[5]have any criticisms of that report?
[6]A Absolutely.
[7]Q What are those criticisms?
[8]A Well, the obvious criticism is she didn't
[9]mention anything about this lesion at all in the right
[10]breast, so this lesion, which we later found out is
[11]cancer and that she wrote this extensive paragraph about
[12]trying to say it was benign in 2016, she has totally
[13]omitted out of this 2015 report, which clearly indicates
[14]she did not see it.
[15]Q Is that a breach of the standard of care in
[16]your opinion?
[17]A In my opinion it is. The whole reason for
[18]doing a breast MRI is to look for breast cancer, and
[19]this is not a small one. This is not a subtle one.
[20]This is not one that anybody can miss. This is one that
[21]anybody should be able to see. This not a -- this is
[22]not someone who wears a size nine shoe trying to fit
[23]into a size 10 shoe. This is a person trying to fit
[24]into a size 1 shoe. This is completely -- this -- that
[25]is the difference between a subtle miss and negligence,
[1]and this is negligence.
[2]MS. HENRY: Thank you, sir. Those are all of
[3]my questions.
[4]MS. FLANAGAN: Nothing else.
