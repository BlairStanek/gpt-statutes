[25]Q. Good evening, Dr. Bozic.
  Page 5
[1]A. Hello.
[2]Q. Would you please state your full name for the
[3]record?
[4]A. Kevin John Bozic.
[5]Q. And Dr. Bozic, where are you located right now?
[6]A. I'm in Austin, Texas.
[7]Q. Are you in your home, or in an office?
[8]A. I'm in my office.
[9]Q. And that's your office affiliated with The
[10]University of Texas?
[11]A. Correct.
[12]Q. We met just a few minutes ago, but my name is
[13]Whitney Butcher, and I represent the plaintiffs who have
[14]lawsuits pending in the District of Maryland, MDL 2775,
[15]which is the Birmingham Hip BHR MDL, if you will.
[16]Today's deposition is going to involve
[17]questions relevant to the THA, or total hip track of
[18]this litigation. You were deposed in October of 2020,
[19]do you remember that deposition?
[20]A. I do.
[21]Q. And that deposition was focused on the BHR
[22]resurfacing products; is that accurate?
[23]A. Yes.
[24]Q. So, do you understand that today's deposition
[25]is to discuss the THA, or total hip products from Smith
  Page 6
[1]& Nephew?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. And would you agree that there's a difference
[4]between the BHR resurfacing and the total hip products?
[5]A. You mean are they different implants, is that
[6]what you're asking?
[7]Q. Yes.
[8]A. Yeah, those are two different implants.
[9]Q. And they're different devices?
[10]A. Actually, I take that back. The acetabular
[11]component can be the same, but the femoral side is
[12]different.
[13]Q. Since you were deposed in the BHR track of this
[14]litigation in October of 2020, have you sat for any
[15]other depositions?
[16]A. No.
[17]Q. So, the same rules will apply: Try not to
[18]speak over one another, let me finish my question before
[19]you answer, so we have a clean record.
[20]The only thing is if I ask a question that
[21]you don't understand, will you please let me know?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. So, if you answer my question, is it fair for
[24]me to assume that you've understood it?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 7
[1]Q. Have you served as an expert witness in any
[2]cases since your deposition in October of 2020?
[3]A. Have I like testified in deposition or
[4]anything?
[5]Q. Correct, since October?
[6]A. No.
[7]Q. And have you been retained in any new cases
[8]since October of 2020?
[9]A. I believe I have.
[10]Q. Any cases involving hip replacements?
[11]A. No.
[12]Q. I am going to share my screen and mark what is
[13]on my screen as Exhibit 1. Can you see that okay, Dr.
[14]Bozic?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. So, I'll mark this as Exhibit 1. This is
[17]plaintiff's notice to take the remote deposition of Dr.
[18]Kevin Bozic.
[19]Let me ask you first if you have seen this
[20]before?
[21]A. Yes, I have.
[22]Q. When?
[23]A. It was shared with me earlier this week by the
[24]Smith & Nephew legal team.
[25]Q. When were you first retained in the THA track
  Page 8
[1]of this litigation?
[2]A. I don't recall specifically, but I'm sure I
[3]could look it up. It was sometime between the
[4]deposition that was taken in October and now.
[5]Q. Was it closer -- well, strike that.
[6]Was it within the last three months?
[7]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[8]THE WITNESS: I can look, I can probably --
[9]let's see. It looks like it was end of April, early May
[10]of 2021.
[11]Q. MS. BUTCHER: Thank you.
[12]I'm gonna scroll down to Exhibit A which
[13]was attached to the notice of your deposition.
[14]Did you receive a copy of Exhibit A here,
[15]Dr. Bozic?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. And this lists a number of items to be
[18]produced. And did you bring any items responsive to
[19]Exhibit A to today's deposition?
[20]A. I believe I worked with Miss Peters to collect
[21]that information, and she has it of.
[22]Q. So - and I'll share that in just a minute, but
[23]I received yesterday some documents from counsel for
[24]Smith & Nephew. So, those documents would be everything
[25]that you had responsive to Exhibit A to your notice of
  Page 9
[1]deposition?
[2]A. Yes, we reviewed all of the these documents
[3]together, I guess, it was yesterday; and I produced all
[4]the information and they collated it and I guess, shared
[5]it with you.
[6]Q. So, you don't have anything in addition to this
[7]that you are producing today?
[8]A. No.
[9]Q. What did you do to prepare for today's
[10]deposition?
[11]A. I reviewed my deposition that was taken in
[12]October of 2020, and I reviewed the materials that were
[13]provided to me since October of 2020.
[14]Q. Did you meet with any attorneys?
[15]A. Yes, I met with the Smith & Nephew legal
[16]counsel on two occasions.
[17]Q. And I don't want to know what you talked about,
[18]but can you tell me on those two occasions for about how
[19]long you met with them?
[20]A. Yes. Actually, it was three occasions because
[21]we had a meeting to discuss that Exhibit A yesterday;
[22]so, two one-hour meetings, and one 20-minute meeting.
[23]Q. I'm going to share my screen again and mark
[24]this as Exhibit 2. Can you see that okay?
[25]A. Yes.
  Page 10
[1]Q. So, Dr. Bozic, these are the objections and
[2]responses that I received yesterday evening from counsel
[3]for Smith & Nephew in response to our notice of your
[4]deposition: Have you seen this before?
[5]A. Not in this form. We discussed it verbally,
[6]but I haven't seen it written.
[7]Q. So, this was what you discussed yesterday
[8]during your phone call, or conversation with Smith &
[9]Nephew counsel?
[10]A. Yesterday, and we had a call last week.
[11]Q. So, I want to ask you a couple of just quick
[12]questions about this. So, in response to Request No. 1
[13]where we asked for all documents reviewed by the
[14]deponent in anticipation of, or in preparation for this
[15]deposition, the response here is that: "S&N responds
[16]that Dr. Bozic reviewed the Notice of Deposition for his
[17]deposition; the Master Amended Consolidated Complaint
[18](MACC) for Plaintiffs with BHR Cups, Modular Femoral
[19]Heads and Stems; the Master Amended Consolidated
[20]Complaint for Plaintiffs with R3 Total Hip Cases; the
[21]Summary of Registry Data; and the General Causation THA
[22]Expert Report of Jeffrey Shapiro, M.D., dated March 22,
[23]2021; Dr. Kevin Bozic's Expert Report, References and
[24]Appendix B thereto, dated August 28, 2020, previously
[25]produced in the BHR Track cases." Did I read that
  Page 11
[1]correctly?
[2]A. Yes.
[3]Q. And is that a complete list of everything that
[4]you reviewed for today's deposition.
[5]A. Yes.
[6]MS. PETERS: If I could interject. I did
[7]e-mail this to Dr. Bozic today so he may have just not
[8]had a chance yet to review it.
[9]Q. MS. BUTCHER: Is there anything in addition to
[10]what I just read that you reviewed in preparation for
[11]today's deposition?
[12]A. No.
[13]Q. So, the summary registry data: What is that
[14]referring to?
[15]A. I got some materials that shared the results
[16]with the BHR and R3 total hip cases from the Australian
[17]registry, and when that data was compared with other
[18]registries.
[19]Let me just check, it was definitely
[20]Australian, and I'm trying to remember if the British
[21]registry was in there as well.
[22]Q. What --
[23]A. Sorry, it's the U.K., Canada, Australian,
[24]Swedish, Scottish, so it has -- it has registry data
[25]from a number of different international registries.
  Page 12
[1]Q. Is this something that you created or something
[2]that Smith & Nephew created?
[3]A. This is something that, as far as I know, Smith
[4]& Nephew created and shared with me.
[5]Q. Can you share that with me, or share that with
[6]your counsel and have her send it to me?
[7]A. Yes.
[8]Q. How many pages is it?
[9]A. I have it in front of me here, it's 39 pages.
[10]Q. And you said it had results of the Smith &
[11]Nephew total hip, and then also the R3 from those
[12]registries you just listed?
[13]A. Correct.
[14]Q. And what are dates that this summary of
[15]registry data document covers?
[16]A. So, the first dates in the report are -- it
[17]goes back to 2000, but it has BHR THA data not reported,
[18]the first date it is reported. So the report goes back
[19]to 2000, and then the first date it has anything
[20]reported is in the Australian registry in 2007. And the
[21]last recorded entry is 2020, from the New Zealand
[22]registry.
[23]Q. In the list of items I just read, it also says
[24]that you reviewed the THA expert report of Dr. Jeffery
[25]Shapiro?
  Page 13
[1]A. Correct.
[2]Q. Did you review his deposition transcripts?
[3]A. No, it's just an expert report.
[4]Q. Did you review any other deposition
[5]transcripts?
[6]A. No.
[7]Q. Did you review any other total hip or THA
[8]expert reports?
[9]A. No, nothing since the last deposition.
[10]Q. Did you review any plaintiff specific expert
[11]reports?
[12]A. No. Well, I -- no, just the report of --
[13]Jeffrey Shapiro is the only expert report.
[14]Q. And so to be clear, what's listed here in
[15]response to No. 1 is everything that you reviewed to
[16]prepare for today's deposition.
[17]A. Correct. And according to this report, Shapiro
[18]is a plaintiff's expert. So you asked if I reviewed any
[19]plaintiffs' expert reports, and I have; I reviewed the
[20]report of Jeffery Shapiro.
[21]Q. Got it. Thank you for clarifying that.
[22]Any other expert reports we've not talked
[23]about that you've reviewed?
[24]A. No.
[25]Q. I want to go down to No. 3: Copies of all
  Page 14
[1]deponent notes, whether handwritten or typed related to
[2]expert work in this matter.
[3]And the Response is: "There are no
[4]documents responsive to this request."
[5]So I just want to make sure: You don't
[6]have any handwritten notes, typed notes, you don't have
[7]anything like that related to the THA track of this
[8]litigation?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. And the same with No. 4: Copies of all
[11]documents provided to deponent by defense counsel on
[12]which the deponent has made notations, highlighting, or
[13]underlying.
[14]And it says, "There are no documents
[15]responsive to this request."
[16]Is that accurate, Dr. Bozic?
[17]A. Yes.
[18]Q. Request No. 7 asks for a list of all books,
[19]treatises, articles, publications, or materials which
[20]the deponent considers authoritative with regard to the
[21]deponent's opinions in this case.
[22]And here the response is: Dr. Bozic
[23]identified materials that he reviewed in Appendix B of
[24]his previously produced expert report in the BHR track
[25]cases.
  Page 15
[1]So, that Appendix B, that was attached to
[2]the expert report you rendered in August of 2020 in the
[3]BHR track of this litigation; is that correct?
[4]A. Correct.
[5]Q. And the materials cited in Exhibit B to your
[6]August 2020 expert report, that did not include any of
[7]the documents that you reviewed specifically for today's
[8]deposition, that we covered a few minutes ago?
[9]A. Can you say that again?
[10]Q. Sure, that was a little confusing.
[11]So, Appendix B to your expert report in
[12]August of 2020, did that include the materials that you
[13]reviewed specifically for today's deposition?
[14]A. I didn't -- I mean, I didn't go back and review
[15]those. I reviewed my report, and then I reviewed
[16]Appendix B, but I didn't go over those original reports
[17]for today's deposition.
[18]Q. Were the documents you reviewed for today's
[19]deposition included in Appendix B, the THA expert report
[20]of Dr. Shapiro, for example?
[21]A. Wait a minute, I'm getting confused with
[22]Appendix A. I thought you were talking about Appendix B
[23]for my report back in my -- that I produced in response
[24]for my deposition in October of 2020.
[25]Q. Correct, that's what I'm talking about.
  Page 16
[1]A. So, the things that are in - what's today's
[2]appendix called, B, A, the one that you just...
[3]Q. Exhibit A to the notice of your deposition.
[4]A. Yeah. So, those are the things that I
[5]reviewed, which included my deposition from -- the
[6]report of my deposition from 2020, as well as Appendix
[7]B. But I did not -- there are a number of materials
[8]listed in Appendix B that I did not go back and
[9]re-review for this deposition.
[10]Q. Request No. 10 just asked for an itemized list
[11]of time, charges, and expenses for services or opinions
[12]rendered in this case. And I received yesterday some
[13]invoices that total $ 10,000 of work that looks like
[14]you've performed on the THA track cases since April of
[15]2021, does that sound about right?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. I will move now and mark this as Exhibit 3, and
[18]this is what I received yesterday. That looks to be an
[19]updated copy of your CV, do you see this all right, Dr.
[20]Bozic?
[21]A. Yes.
[22]Q. And June 2021, is this the most updated version
[23]of your CV?
[24]A. Yes.
[25]Q. Have there been any major changes to it since
  Page 17
[1]your deposition in October?
[2]A. I mean, there are changes every week, like I
[3]gave a keynote address at a meeting last week. But I
[4]know that my team officially updates the paper version
[5]once a month, so they probably are about to do July,
[6]because they do it the last week of the month.
[7]Q. Right here at the top it lists you as Dell
[8]Medical School, University of Texas at Austin,
[9]Department of Surgery, and Perioperative Care.
[10]There we are, professor and chair is what I
[11]was looking for.
[12]Do you still see patients?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. Can you give me a breakdown of your practice
[15]teaching versus seeing patients?
[16]A. So, about 20 percent of my time -- excuse me,
[17]40 percent of my time is spent clinically, and pretty
[18]much all of my teaching occurs during that 40 percent of
[19]the time.
[20]The other 60 percent of my time is spent in
[21]administrative roles as chair of a department, and
[22]executive director of a service line, health system
[23]service line.
[24]So, 40 percent is spent in clinical roles,
[25]and all my clinical roles are teaching roles. So for
  Page 18
[1]instance, I was operating until five minutes before we
[2]got on here, and I had trainees with me all day.
[3]Q. Got it.
[4]Do you have a separately orthopedic
[5]practice apart from the University of Texas?
[6]A. No.
[7]Q. On Page 3. So, just a quick question about
[8]this: So, under medical licenses and certifications, it
[9]says Texas Medical Board physician full permit. And
[10]says expires May 31 of 2020.
[11]Does that just need to be updated?
[12]A. Yeah, I'm glad you pointed that out.
[13]Q. So you still -- or you currently hold a license
[14]from the medical body to practice medicine in Texas,
[15]correct?
[16]A. Yes.
[17]Q. And has any action ever been taken against that
[18]professional license?
[19]A. No.
[20]Q. Last quick question about your CV: So, when I
[21]asked you about the updates, I noticed a couple of
[22]things from January to June. Looks like these would
[23]have been added since you were deposed in October, and
[24]there's a series of lectures on values based healthcare.
[25]Do you see where I'm looking?
  Page 19
[1]A. Okay, um-hm.
[2]Q. What was the purpose of those lectures on value
[3]based healthcare, or value based care?
[4]A. So, I teach in an executive education course at
[5]Harvard Business School on the principles of value based
[6]healthcare, which is an economic theory for competition
[7]in healthcare.
[8]Q. So, would you agree with me that a hip
[9]replacement failing prematurely and requiring a revision
[10]surgery would not promote value based healthcare?
[11]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[12]THE WITNESS: That's kind of, that's not --
[13]I don't know what you mean. But no, that's not related.
[14]So, value based healthcare means
[15]competition based on outcomes and costs. So, it's a
[16]framework for competition in healthcare.
[17]Q. MS. BUTCHER: But a total hip replacement, or a
[18]metal-on-metal total hip replacement that is fails
[19]prematurely, that would not be considered a positive
[20]outcome, for example?
[21]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[22]THE WITNESS: I would say -- I would say
[23]that yeah, if a patient has a procedure and the implant
[24]fails before the anticipated duration or lifespan of the
[25]prosthesis, that that would be a suboptimal outcome, I
  Page 20
[1]would agree with that.
[2]Q. MS. BUTCHER: You gave me a breakdown of your
[3]time, and I heard you say 40 percent is spent in the
[4]clinical kind of realm, and then 60 percent in kind of a
[5]more administrative role, did I get that correct?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Could you carve out for me how much of your
[8]time is spent serving as an expert witness?
[9]A. Less than two percent.
[10]Q. And has any court ever refused to certify you
[11]as an expert at trial?
[12]A. No.
[13]Q. I will mark what's on my screen as Exhibit 4,
[14]and this is Defendant's Supplemental General Liability
[15]and Causation Expert Disclosure, and this is in the THA
[16]track: Have you ever seen this document, Dr. Bozic?
[17]A. Sorry, go back up to the top.
[18]Yes.
[19]Q. And it's disclosing you as an expert witness
[20]for Smith & Nephew in the THA track of this litigation;
[21]is that accurate?
[22]A. Yes.
[23]Q. And if we scroll the page to -- well, so at
[24]bottom of Page 1: "Defendant refers plaintiffs to Dr.
[25]Bozic's written report in the BHR track which was served
  Page 21
[1]on August 28 of 2020. Dr. Bozic's BHR track report
[2]contains all of the opinions he intends to offer in this
[3]THA track."
[4]Did I read that correctly?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. So, according to this: Your report in the BHR
[7]track from August 28th contains any opinions that you
[8]intend to offer in the THA track of this litigation; is
[9]that accurate?
[10]A. Yes.
[11]Q. So, any opinions -- strike that.
[12]At the time that you authored the report
[13]from August of 2020, you had not received any of the
[14]documentation that you reviewed to prepare for today's
[15]deposition; is that accurate?
[16]MS. PETERS: Form.
[17]THE WITNESS: Correct.
[18]Q. MS. BUTCHER: So, the summary of registry data
[19]that you mentioned earlier, you hadn't had the benefit
[20]of reviewing that at the time of the your August 2020,
[21]BHR track report?
[22]A. Correct.
[23]Q. And how about Dr. Shapiro's THA report?
[24]A. I had not reviewed that as of August, 2020.
[25]Q. And down in italics it says, "Availability for
  Page 22
[1]deposition: Dr. Bozic was deposed in the BHR track on
[2]October 21, 2020, and since he offers no new opinions in
[3]the THA track, no additional deposition is necessary."
[4]Did I read that correctly?
[5]A. Yes.
[6]Q. Do you agree that -- well, strike that.
[7]Is it -- you're not here to offer any new
[8]opinions in THA track of this litigation?
[9]A. Correct.
[10]Q. At the time that you were deposed in October of
[11]2020, had you received any of the documentation that you
[12]reviewed to prepare for today's deposition?
[13]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[14]THE WITNESS: My report, and Appendix B of
[15]that report, that was one of the things I reviewed for
[16]today, so I had that.
[17]Q. MS. BUTCHER: The summary of registry data?
[18]A. No, my expert report from August of 2020, I had
[19]in October of 2020 when I was deposed.
[20]Q. Got it. But that's the only document that you
[21]reviewed to prepare for today's deposition that you had
[22]at the time of your October 2020 deposition?
[23]A. Correct.
[24]Q. I will mark as Exhibit 5, a document that I
[25]have on my screen, and this is expert report of Kevin
  Page 23
[1]Bozic, and it's dated August 28, 2020: And is that your
[2]signature?
[3]A. That's my signature.
[4]Q. And is this the only report you have produced
[5]for the Smith & Nephew hip litigation?
[6]A. Yes.
[7]Q. Did you prepare or provide a separate report
[8]specific to the THA track of this litigation?
[9]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[10]THE WITNESS: No.
[11]Q. MS. BUTCHER: Jump to page -- all right. So,
[12]this is the last page of your report. And here you say
[13]-- you cite to the report of Mari Truman of Page 6.
[14]Do you see that?
[15]A. Yes.
[16]Q. So, since you rendered this report, have you
[17]had a chance to review Mari Truman's report concerning
[18]the THA devices?
[19]A. No.
[20]Q. And since your report, have you reviewed Mari
[21]Truman's THA report regarding, or discussing registry
[22]data?
[23]A. No.
[24]Q. And so to be clear: What Mari Truman said or
[25]didn't say in her THA report is not addressed in this
  Page 24
[1]report of yours from August of 2020?
[2]A. I mean, it's the report of Mari Truman that I
[3]had available to me in August of 2020, Page 6.
[4]Q. I'm sorry, I should have been clear. That was
[5]her, the -- Mari Truman's BHR report?
[6]A. Can we look at the Appendix? I don't remember
[7]what was included in that report.
[8]Q. Sure.
[9]A. If we can go back and look at it for this -- in
[10]preparation for this deposition.
[11]Q. So, I will -- I've pull up this is Appendix B,
[12]Dr. Bozic, do you see that okay?
[13]A. Yes.
[14]Q. And this was marked as an Exhibit at your first
[15]deposition.
[16]A. Um-hm.
[17]Q. And right here it says, "expert report, you
[18]reviewed the expert report of Mari Truman and Exhibits."
[19]A. Yeah.
[20]Q. So, if I represented to you that Mari Truman's
[21]report in the THA track of this litigation wasn't issued
[22]until 2021, then that's not the report you would be
[23]referencing here supporting your August of 2020 report?
[24]A. Correct.
[25]Q. Go back to Exhibit 5. Is any of the
  Page 25
[1]information that Smith & Nephew shared with you between
[2]October of 2020 and today, is any of that reflected in
[3]this report that you produced in August of 2020?
[4]A. No.
[5]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[6]Q. MS. BUTCHER: In the report that you produced
[7]in August of 2020, does it include an analysis of any
[8]facts or data specific to the THA?
[9]A. No.
[10]Q. And any -- in this report from August of 2020,
[11]have you disclosed any opinions as it relates to
[12]registry data concerning the THA?
[13]MS. PETERS: Objection, form.
[14]THE WITNESS: Can you repeat that?
[15]Q. MS. BUTCHER: In your expert report from August
[16]of 2020, do you disclose any opinions regarding the
[17]registry data involving THA?
[18]A. I mean, I refer to registries in general and
