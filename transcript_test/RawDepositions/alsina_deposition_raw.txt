[10]Q I want to, for the record, show you a
[11]copy of the deposition notice and ask you to take
[12]a look at that document, please. And specifically
[13]I'm interested in what's page No. 4, what we call
[14]Exhibit A, duces tecum. Do you see that?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q And it asks you to bring certain
[17]materials with you today; correct?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q And before we went on the record you
[20]showed us a stack of papers that you brought in,
[21]which consist of a copy of your report, the first
[22]pages of certain journal articles, and then a
[23]handwritten note. Is that everything that you
[24]brought with you today?
[25]A Yes.
  Page 7
[1]Q Okay. And can you just explain why did
[2]you bring these materials today as opposed to any
[3]others?
[4]A Because it was new materials.
[5]Q So other than the papers that are
[6]identified by the first pages that you brought
[7]with you today, everything else upon which you've
[8]relied in preparing your report, all of the
[9]materials are identified in the report; is that
[10]fair?
[11]A Yes. I mean, there may have been a
[12]couple of other references. I don't know if I'll
[13]use them today to answer any questions, but those
[14]were the main ones.
[15]Q And we're going to make a copy of those
[16]new references you brought and get to those in a
[17]moment.
[18]The other thing we asked for is copies of
[19]any deposition or trial testimony previously given
[20]by you. Now, I have the deposition that you gave
[21]in this case back on November 29th of 2018. Have
[22]you been a witness in any other cases since then?
[23]A Yes, but I haven't kept track of that. I
[24]don't have files for that. I don't do this for a
[25]living, so going back 15, 20 years I may have done
  Page 8
[1]depositions two or three times, or whatever, but I
[2]don't have any records of that. I couldn't
[3]provide you anything.
[4]Q Okay. How about, have you given any
[5]deposition testimony besides the deposition in
[6]this case during the past four years?
[7]A That's hard to know. In the past 10
[8]years probably a couple of depositions of patients
[9]in our system that were, you know, seeking some
[10]workmens' compensation, things like that.
[11]Q You may or may not have given -- and the
[12]reason I'm asking about the last four years is
[13]there's a rule in the Federal Rules of Civil
[14]Procedure that requires you to identify any cases
[15]and all cases in which you have testified either
[16]at trial or by deposition within the past four
[17]years in your report, and I was just wondering if
[18]that's something that can be done, if we need to
[19]try to supplement that, or is that not something
[20]that can be done?
[21]A It could be done. I would have to try to
[22]see if there's any records of that.
[23]Q Okay. I should probably follow up with
[24]Mr. Haberman if we need to try to look at that
[25]stuff?
  Page 9
[1]A True.
[2]Q Have you ever given a deposition before
[3]other than the one you gave in this case that
[4]involved allegations that an oral contraceptive
[5]caused a hepatic adenoma?
[6]A No.
[7]Q So this is the only case in which you've
[8]ever testified where those facts were at issue; is
[9]that correct?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Have you ever given any deposition
[12]testimony in any case at all that involved oral
[13]contraceptives in any way?
[14]A No.
[15]Q How about a benign hepatic adenoma?
[16]Besides this case, can you think of any other
[17]where you've ever given a deposition where one of
[18]the issues in the case was the fact that somebody
[19]had a benign hepatic adenoma?
[20]A No.
[21]Q Okay. So this is new ground for you,
[22]then, as far as deposition or trial testimony?
[23]This Michelle Smith case is the first time you've
[24]ever confronted a case like this; is that correct?
[25]A On this subject.
  Page 10
[1]Q Okay. And we also asked for copies of
[2]the documents that you have about the time you've
[3]spent in connection with this litigation. Do you
[4]have anything like that with you?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q And thank you, Doctor, you've handed me a
[7]copy of what looks like an invoice from you to
[8]Attorney Haberman, and it's dated February 3rd,
[9]2019, and in the amount of $ 6,665. And I'd like
[10]to mark that as Exhibit 2 to the deposition -- no,
[11]I'm sorry, we're going to mark it out of order as
[12]deposition Exhibit 3 to the deposition.
[13](Exhibit No. 3 was marked for purposes of
[14]identification.)
[15]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[16]Q I'll ask you, Doctor: Is this all the
[17]time that you have committed to this project now,
[18]or is there still some unbilled time?
[19]A There's still some unbilled time.
[20]There's plenty of other time that I've spent time
[21]on this case.
[22]Q And you're charging Ms. Smith $ 500 an
[23]hour for the work that you do in this case;
[24]correct?
[25]A Yes. You already have that information.
  Page 11
[1]Q Okay. And that's the same. It doesn't
[2]matter if it's testimony or literature search,
[3]whatever the task is, that's your hourly rate, is
[4]$ 500; is that right?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q Okay. Thank you.
[7]And you prepared a report which contains
[8]your expert opinions in this case, and it's dated
[9]March 20TH, 2019; correct?
[10]A Yes.
[11](Exhibit No. 2 was marked for purposes of
[12]identification.)
[13]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[14]Q All right. I want to hand you my copy of
[15]that report that I've marked as Exhibit 2. And
[16]I've copied it on two sides of the page there just
[17]to save some paper.
[18]But my question to you, sir, is first of
[19]all -- I'm going to have a number of questions
[20]throughout the morning about that report, but I
[21]just want to ask you, first of all, if you can
[22]confirm on the record that that is a copy of your
[23]expert witness report in this case.
[24]A Yes, it is.
[25]Q And if you'll turn to page -- well, first
  Page 12
[1]of all, let me just ask: You've expressed certain
[2]opinions in this report about this case; correct?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q And if you'll look at page -- it looks
[5]like it's the sixth page of the report. I don't
[6]see page numbers, but it's the one that has a copy
[7]of an image at the top. Do you see that?
[8]A Right.
[9]Q Roman numeral I under heading
[10]"Professional Opinion" states the following: "It
[11]is my professional opinion that Teva developed
[12]inadequate warnings of the drugs Seasonique and
[13]Seasonale as to the risk of developing hepatic
[14]adenomas. Teva used outdated data with lower than
[15]known risks. The known risks of adenomas and of
[16]bleeding at the time of drug approval should have
[17]been clearly communicated to the physicians
[18]prescribing these drugs. Physicians should have
[19]also been informed that the risk dramatically
[20]increases with long-term use. Instead, while
[21]earlier versions of the labels stated that the
[22]risk increases after four years of use, the label
[23]may confuse physicians because it is unclear
[24]whether the risk increases to 3.3 per 100,000
[25]users or whether the risk is actually greater."
  Page 13
[1]Did I read that professional opinion
[2]correctly?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q And that is one of your opinions in this
[5]case; correct?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q Okay. And then if we look at page 8
[8]under the heading Roman numeral II, you also state
[9]the following: "It is my professional opinion
[10]that the plaintiff developed a very large hepatic
[11]adenoma and innumerable other ones as a result of
[12]longstanding use of oral contraceptive use."
[13]Did I read that correctly?
[14]A Yes.
[15]Q And is that your second opinion that
[16]you're prepared to offer in this case, that you
[17]have offered in this case?
[18]A According to the numbers, it is.
[19]Q Okay. And then you have on page 10 under
[20]Roman numeral III the following: "Despite fatty
[21]liver with inflammation, her adenomas were most
[22]likely caused by oral contraceptives,
[23]unquestionably."
[24]Did I read that correctly?
[25]A Yes.
  Page 14
[1]Q And is that one of your opinions in this
[2]case?
[3]A Yes.
[4]Q Okay. And then moving over to Roman
[5]numeral IV on page 13, it says, "It is my
[6]professional opinion that the complications she
[7]sustained due to the use of oral contraceptives
[8]affected her and delayed her ability to become
[9]pregnant and have children for the time period
[10]between 2013 and 2015. While the presence of
[11]hepatic adenomas is not a contraindication to
[12]pregnancy, Ms. Smith may reasonably fear getting
[13]pregnant given her past medical history. The
[14]January 20, 2017 MRI revealed a 3.7 centimeter
[15]right hepatic lobe mass consistent with adenoma
[16]versus focal nodular hyperplasia. She will need
[17]long-term follow-up for this condition."
[18]Did I read that correctly?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q And is that also one of your opinions in
[21]this case?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q Now, my question just generally is: Have
[24]I now read into the record the professional
[25]opinions that you have rendered in this matter?
  Page 15
[1]A Yes, you have.
[2]Q And you don't have any additional or
[3]other opinions than those that we've just read
[4]into the record; correct?
[5]A That is incorrect. If you ask me
[6]questions I may have different opinions. I don't
[7]know what other opinions are there.
[8]Q Okay. Well, other than opinions you
[9]might have about my questions, have I now read
[10]into the record the opinions that you've been
[11]retained by Michelle Smith to give in this case?
[12]A Those are the opinions that are in the
[13]report.
[14]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[15]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[16]Q All I'm trying to get at is before you
[17]answer a single question of mine, do you have
[18]other professional opinions that you are
[19]prepared -- let me back up.
[20]You understand that the purpose of an
[21]expert witness disclosure is to reveal and
[22]identify your opinions. Is that okay? Is that
[23]fair? Can we agree on that?
[24]A Sure.
[25]Q All I'm asking you is have you done that,
  Page 16
[1]have you revealed and identified in this document
[2]the opinions that you're prepared to offer in this
[3]case?
[4]A Right. And it says at the end if there's
[5]more information that can come, I can change my
[6]opinions and maybe there's new opinions. Right?
[7]Like any other expert witness would put at the end
[8]of a report.
[9]Q Sure. We all have opinions about things
[10]that evolve constantly, but what I want to
[11]clarify -- and I'm not sure I have yet -- is
[12]whether as you sit here today, before I ask you
[13]any questions about your report, do you have any
[14]other opinions that have not been identified in
[15]this report that you're going to testify to at the
[16]trial of this case?
[17]A I don't know. It could be in my brain,
[18]opinions that may come up during the questioning.
[19]I have nothing else right now except the four
[20]points that you just read.
[21]Q That's really what I'm asking. Can you
[22]identify any others for me right now other than
[23]those four?
[24]A Those are the four that are stated.
[25]Q Okay. Thank you.
  Page 17
[1]When you were last deposed in this case,
[2]on November 29th of 2018, I asked you if you had
[3]been retained as an expert witness, and you said
[4]that at time you had not; correct?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q And at that time -- well, when were you
[7]retained as an expert?
[8]A Probably a few days later, after
[9]conversations with Mr. Haberman.
[10]Q And between the date of that last
[11]deposition, which was November 29th of 2018, and
[12]March 20th, 2019, the date of your report, can you
[13]generally tell us what you have done to prepare
[14]the opinions that are reflected in this report?
[15]A Well, besides all the literature, all the
[16]documents, all the depositions from all the people
[17]that were deposed -- there were probably four or
[18]five depositions -- records that were not
[19]available at the original deposition were reviewed
[20]from the front admission, different outpatient
[21]physicians, that sort of thing.
[22]Q So you reviewed additional materials,
[23]including depositions and medical journal papers.
[24]Are the materials that you reviewed, other than
[25]the ones that you brought with you this morning,
  Page 18
[1]identified in your report?
[2]A Yes. Most of the materials that are in
[3]this report were not in the original deposition
[4]and available, so they are listed here now because
[5]they became available later.
[6]Q Okay. Does this report identify --
[7]again, other than the additional documents you
[8]brought with you today -- does this report
[9]identify the bases for your opinions, the grounds
[10]for them?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q Does it also identify the facts and the
[13]data that you considered in connection with
[14]forming your opinions?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q And Doctor, you're a liver surgeon;
[17]correct?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q And you've never prescribed oral
[20]contraceptives; correct?
[21]A No.
[22]Q I'm sorry, that was a bad question.
[23]The answer no, it is a fact that you have
[24]never prescribed oral contraceptives?
[25]A That is a fact, true fact.
  Page 19
[1]Q You have never discussed with a patient,
[2]therefore, the risks versus the benefits of
[3]prescribing an oral contraceptive for that
[4]patient; correct?
[5]A Incorrect.
[6]Q You have discussed the risks versus the
[7]benefits of oral contraceptives with a patient?
[8]A Multiple times and continue to do it as
[9]often as this week.
[10]Q In what context does that discussion
[11]arise?
[12]A Because we continue to see the adenomas,
[13]and the patients are on oral contraceptives, so I
[14]discuss it with them; they have to make their own
[15]decisions.
[16]Q So when you see a patient with adenomas,
[17]you discuss the fact that oral contraceptives are
[18]a risk factor for those; is that correct?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q When is the first time you ever read a
[21]warning, the warning section of an oral
[22]contraceptive label as it relates to hepatic
[23]adenoma?
[24]A Before the deposition we had the last
[25]time.
  Page 20
[1]Q So before the deposition in November of
[2]2018, was it in preparation for that deposition
[3]that you first read the prescribing information
[4]for an oral contraceptive?
[5]A Yes, as I stated in my deposition.
[6]Q The risk/benefit discussion that you just
[7]testified that you've had with patients about oral
[8]contraceptives, right, did you have such
[9]conversations with patients before November of
[10]2018?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q And you would have those conversations
[13]even though you hadn't at that time ever read the
[14]prescribing information for oral contraceptives;
[15]is that correct?
[16]A I may have, but I hadn't read anything
[17]about these drugs that are here being discussed.
[18]Q Well, when you're talking with patients
[19]about oral contraceptives, isn't your conversation
[20]really limited to the risk side of the equation as
[21]opposed to the benefit side?
[22]A Yes. I would think that would be pretty
[23]accurate.
[24]Q So unlike an obstetrician/gynecologist,
[25]or a women's health professional who has to
  Page 21
[1]consider both the risks and the benefits of oral
[2]contraceptives for a patient, you are dealing with
[3]patients who already have a condition with a
[4]reported association with oral contraceptives, and
[5]so you want to let them know that their continued
[6]use of oral contraceptives in that situation is
[7]risky; correct?
[8]A Yes. And they probably will do the
[9]opposite, more the benefit than the risk, because
[10]they don't see the adenomas so much as we see the
[11]adenomas.
[12]Q You've identified in your report on
[13]page 6, just above Roman numeral I, you identify
[14]two oral contraceptive package inserts that you
[15]reviewed, namely -- well, you tell me. What oral
[16]contraceptive labels have you reviewed in
[17]connection with your opinions in this case?
[18]A Just the Seasonale package inserts.
[19]Q And it says two, 2009, 2017. So I'm just
[20]wondering, did you review one Seasonique from 2009
[21]and one Seasonale from 2017, or did you review two
[22]of each from those years?
[23]A It's just what is stated there, the
[24]Seasonale 2017, the Seasonale from 2003, which was
[25]revised in 2009 --
  Page 22
[1]Q Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
[2]A -- Seasonale from 2008.
[3]Q You read one Seasonique label and two
[4]Seasonale labels; is that right?
[5]A Let me check. I think I reviewed 2009
[6]and 2017 Seasonique and Seasonale labels, that's
[7]what it says at the top. The text at the bottom
[8]sort of explains when there were revisions made
[9]and when were the reports available.
[10]Q Okay. My question is: Are these the
[11]only oral contraceptive labels that you've ever
[12]personally reviewed?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q So the only oral contraceptive labels
[15]that you've ever reviewed at any point in your
[16]life were in connection with your work in this
[17]case; is that correct?
[18]A Possibly.
[19]Q Okay. Do you know what ACOG is?
[20]A ACOG, A-C-O-G?
[21]Q Yes.
[22]A Sounds like the American College of
[23]Obstetrics and Gynecology.
[24]Q Very good.
[25]You're not a member of ACOG; correct?
  Page 23
[1]A No.
[2]Q You're not a gynecologist; correct?
[3]A No.
[4]Q You're not an obstetrician; correct?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q Have you ever reviewed any ACOG
[7]guidelines with regard to the prescribing of oral
[8]contraceptives?
[9]A I don't remember coming across those in
[10]my literature. If they're not stated here, I
[11]probably have not.
[12]Q Okay. Do you know what ACOG practice
[13]bulletins are?
[14]A No.
[15]Q So you've never reviewed an ACOG practice
[16]bulletin; correct?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q Have you ever worked at the Food and Drug
[19]Administration?
[20]A No, sir.
[21]Q Have you ever counseled a pharmaceutical
[22]company about oral contraceptives labeling in
[23]connection with submitting an application for
[24]approval of a drug?
[25]A No.
  Page 24
[1]Q Have you ever counseled a pharmaceutical
[2]company about oral contraceptive labeling in any
[3]context?
[4]A No.
[5]Q How about for any drug? Have you ever
[6]counseled any pharmaceutical company ever in
[7]connection with the labeling of any drug?
[8]A I don't think so.
[9]Q Have you ever discussed with any drug
[10]company -- well, I'm sorry, let me ask you a
[11]different question.
[12]Have you ever published any articles in
[13]the scientific or medical literature about oral
[14]contraceptives?
[15]A Not specifically about that topic. It
[16]may have been mentioned in a text inside, but not
[17]about that topic.
[18]Q Have you ever published any articles in
[19]the medical or scientific literature that
[20]specifically focused on benign hepatic adenoma?
[21]A There's some case reports in my
[22]bibliography about patients that we had that
[23]developed benign hepatic tumors such as adenomas
[24]and hepatocellular carcinomas.
[25]Q But the focus of those papers was never
  Page 25
[1]on any reported relationship between oral
[2]contraceptives and the development of hepatic
[3]adenomas; correct?
[4]A Correct.
[5]Q Have you ever published any articles in
[6]the scientific or medical literature about the
[7]labeling of drug products?
[8]A No.
[9]Q And have you ever lectured on the topic
[10]of oral contraceptives or drug labeling?
[11]A No.
[12]Q Other than this case, in connection with
[13]this case, have you ever had any professional
[14]involvement with the issue of the warnings about
[15]the risks of hepatic adenoma in women who use oral
[16]contraceptives?
[17]A You mean like legal involvement or --
[18]Q I just want to know about whether -- I'm
[19]trying to understand -- I guess I don't understand
[20]your question, so let me start over.
[21]Do you know what class labeling is?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q What's class labeling?
[24]A It's a label that's given by the FDA for
[25]a product without specific data on the product
  Page 26
[1]being on the label. They use old data for many
[2]different drugs, and the company uses that label.
[3]Whether it pertains to their product or not, they
[4]use it, just like in the case of Teva and
[5]Seasonique and Seasonale.
[6]Q Well, are you saying that the warnings
[7]for hepatic adenoma that you read on Seasonique
[8]and Seasonale are of the type that can be
[9]characterized as class labeling?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q How do you know that?
[12]A I read Mrs. Carle's deposition.
[13]Q Whose deposition?
[14]A Mrs. Carle's.
[15]Q I see. So you read the deposition of a
[16]Teva witness, Lisa Carle?
[17]A Yes, she works for Teva.
[18]Q Well, actually, she doesn't work for
[19]Teva, she works for another company, but that's --
[20]she doesn't work for the defendant in this
[21]lawsuit, but that's a different issue.
[22]But you read her deposition, and from
[23]that deposition you first learned that these
[24]warnings are class labeled?
[25]A No, because I dealt with other companies
  Page 27
[1]before that have class labels on the products that
[2]I use, so I was familiar with the term. But I
[3]learned from that deposition quite a bit, and I
[4]went through her answers carefully.
[5]Q Yeah. I'm trying to get a sense of
[6]just -- I'm just focusing on the warning section
[7]of the label as it relates to hepatic adenoma. Is
[8]the deposition of Lisa Carle in this case the
[9]first time that you knew that the warnings that
[10]appear in the Seasonique and Seasonale labels also
[11]appear in other combination oral contraceptive
[12]labels?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q Okay. And I think one of the things that
[15]you said when you were relaying your understanding
[16]about class labeling is that the FDA gets
[17]information from everyone who has drugs in the
[18]class; isn't that right?
[19]A They have to -- once they conduct the
[20]study, and if they want to submit the study, they
[21]have information on every product.
[22]Q Did you read any other corporate witness
[23]depositions in this case besides Ms. Carle's?
[24]A She's the only one that I came across.
[25]Q Okay. Do you know what adverse event
  Page 28
[1]reports are?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q Generally, what's your understanding of
[4]what an adverse event report is?
[5]A The FDA has to be given reports about new
[6]adverse events post marketing or during the study,
[7]so that's what that is and sometimes they're
[8]yearly reports. That's what that is.
[9]Q So you're aware that at least as it
[10]relates to -- at least once a year drug companies
[11]have to submit or summarize for the FDA all of the
[12]adverse events that get reported to them about the
[13]drugs that they market; correct?
[14]A I don't know how often they have to do
[15]it, but I know that they have to do it.
[16]Mrs. Carle mentioned the yearly reports, but I
[17]don't know how accurate that is.
[18]Q Okay. Do you know how many oral
[19]contraceptive drug labels the FDA has approved
[20]since 2006?
[21]A No.
[22]Q Okay. Actually, before we start digging
[23]into your report, I want to ask you a couple
[24]questions to follow up on some things that you had
[25]said at your last deposition to make sure I

[1]understand. So I'm going to hand you a document
[2]that we're now going to mark as Exhibit 4.
[3](Exhibit No. 4 was marked for purposes of
[4]identification.)
[5]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[6]Q And I'm going to ask you to take a look
[7]at that.
[8]MR. SUFFERN: Jeff, for the record, this
[9]is an excerpt from some of the exhibits that we
[10]had marked at Dr. Alsina's deposition last
[11]time, and specifically these are some of the
[12]handwritten notes that he had brought with him
[13]to the deposition.
[14]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[15]Q Can you confirm what I just said to
[16]Mr. Haberman? Does that appear to be a true and
[17]accurate copy of some of your handwritten notes
[18]that you brought to the last deposition?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q And the first thing I want to ask you
[21]about is the one that's circled No. 1. You had
[22]done a literature search back then which
[23]identified 307 articles; correct?
[24]A Correct.
[25]Q And at the time of that deposition had
  Page 30
[1]you reviewed any of those 307 articles?
[2]A Not all of them were pertinent, so I
[3]deleted some of them. You do the search and you
[4]come up with pertinent and not pertinent articles,
[5]and you focus on the ones that are important.
[6]Q Okay. So of the 307 articles that your
[7]literature search yielded, you reviewed some
[8]number of those, but not all of them, before your
[9]last deposition; is that fair?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Okay. And in connection with your work
[12]as a retained expert in this case you've looked at
[13]additional articles; correct?
[14]A Yes.
[15]Q And those are the ones identified in your
[16]report or the few that you brought with you today;
[17]correct?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q If you'll look at the second page of this
[20]document I just gave you, this Exhibit 4, your
[21]handwritten notes, you made comments for each
[22]of -- I'm looking at Roman numeral IV. You
[23]reviewed the full Schlesinger complaint from the
[24]U.S. District Court; is that right?
[25]A Yes.
  Page 31
[1]Q And you identified that here in your
[2]report as well as one of the documents you
[3]reviewed, the complaint in this case; correct?
[4]A Correct.
[5]Q Have you ever reviewed the amended
[6]complaint in this case?
[7]A No, not at all.
[8]Q Okay. So if the amended complaint in
[9]this case sets forth different facts about the
[10]duration of Ms. Smith's use of oral contraceptives
[11]and the years in which she started using oral
[12]contraceptives, for example, you just don't know
[13]that; is that correct?
[14]A Yeah, I don't know what amendments have
[15]been made.
[16]Q All right. Now, just so we have a
[17]complete report of the documents that you're
[18]relying upon, let me mark as an exhibit, please,
[19]those additional papers that you brought with you
[20]to the deposition.
[21]And if you don't mind, I'm just going to
[22]separate from your copy of the report -- I'll hand
[23]that back to you. I'm just going to mark these
[24]first pages of these papers as an exhibit, a group
[25]exhibit, and we'll call it Exhibit No. 5.
  Page 32
[1](Exhibit No. 5 was marked for purposes of
[2]identification.)
[3]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[4]Q And just so that we'll have in the record
[5]a copy of everything -- well, let me just ask.
[6]Now that I've marked as Exhibit 5 those papers, do
[7]we now have, if you add those references to the
[8]list of references that have been identified in
[9]your report, which is Exhibit 2, would we now have
[10]a complete list of all the references upon which
[11]you are relying for your opinions today?
[12]A I think that would be accurate.
[13]Q Okay. Now I'm going to mark as Exhibit 6
[14]another document that -- and I'm just going to ask
[15]you, would you mind if I kind of moved over next
[16]to you for a minute, because I want to look on
[17]this with you because we only have one copy. Can
[18]you just explain what Exhibit 6 is?
[19](Exhibit No. 6 was marked for purposes of
[20]identification.)
[21]THE WITNESS: It's a link between the
[22]different obesity metabolic syndrome, fatty
[23]liver, topics to adenomas. It's like a little
[24]schematic.
[25]BY MR. SUFFERN:
  Page 33
[1]Q This is something you prepared?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q And at the bottom it says, "Other
[4]factors"; correct?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q Do you mean by that other risk factors
[7]for hepatic adenoma besides oral contraceptives?
[8]Is that what you mean?
[9]A Yes. Other factors that are not in that
[10]other chart, yes.
[11]Q Not in what other chart?
[12]A In this one here, other factors such as
[13]antigens or mutations or diseases that are linked
[14]to adenomas like medical diseases.
[15]Q I see. So your intent -- you have a big
[16]circle in the middle that says, "HCA." I assume
[17]that stands for hepatic adenoma?
[18]A Hepatocellular adenoma.
[19]Q Hepatocellular adenoma.
[20]And around that circle you have a number
[21]of other things pointing to the circle.
[22]Was it your intent to identify, at least
[23]in a general way on this piece of paper, those
[24]factors that are understood by the medical and
[25]professional community to be risk factors for the
  Page 34
[1]development of hepatocellular adenoma?
[2]A This is a combination of all the
[3]information that I gathered that I know and how I
[4]understand it and how I interpreted that data.
[5]Q Okay. So the circle that says other risk
[6]factors here, that means that those are things
[7]that you didn't itemize, such as glycogen storage
[8]disease, for example?
[9]A That's one of them.
[10]Q But one you did identify is obesity;
[11]right?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q Another that you identified is fatty
[14]liver; correct?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Another that you identified is
[17]nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; correct?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Another that you identified is
[20]nonalcoholic --
[21]A Steatohepatitis.
[22]Q -- steatohepatitis?
[23]A Yes.
[24]Q NASH, N-A-S-H; right?
[25]A Yes. That's on the diagram.
  Page 35
[1]Q And then what's this one down here?
[2]A Metabolic syndrome and cancer.
[3]Q Now, of these other risk factors that
[4]you've identified, it's fair to say that
[5]Michelle Smith had some of them as well as her
[6]oral contraceptive use; correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q So she had nonalcoholic fatty liver
[9]disease; correct?
[10]A She had NASH, but even a little bit more
[11]than that. She had NASH.
[12]Q So there's a progression, then. So fatty
[13]liver can progress to NASH, which can ultimately
[14]progress to cirrhosis; is that fair?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Okay. And so she had a condition that
[17]was really a little more advanced than just fatty
[18]liver. She had actually a diagnosis of NASH;
[19]correct?
[20]A According to the biopsy, yes.
[21]Q Okay. And then she also at times, she
[22]had -- she qualified for a diagnosis of obesity;
[23]correct?
[24]A She had a body mass index of 30.
[25]Q Which is the commonly accepted definition
  Page 36
[1]of obese; correct?
[2]A Yes.
[3]Q Okay. Now, you agree, correct,
[4]Dr. Alsina, that -- well, this is a true
[5]statement, isn't it? Not all hepatocellular
[6]adenomas are caused by oral contraceptives;
[7]correct?
[8]A Correct.
[9]Q And it's also true that the vast majority
[10]of women who use oral contraceptives will never
[11]get a hepatocellular adenoma; is that correct?
[12]A I cannot comment on that because you're
[13]talking about incidents here, and there's no new
[14]incident studies, and I'm not going to answer that
[15]question.
[16]Q Okay. When you say there are no new
[17]incident studies, what do you mean by that?
[18]A Well, I haven't seen anything like in the
[19]last two years or five years that talks about how
[20]many women are exposed to them. We would have to
[21]know how many women are exposed to oral
[22]contraceptives and then how many get them.
[23]Q Okay.
[24]A You and I don't have that literature.
[25]Q Okay. You talk about many papers that
  Page 37
[1]report an incidence of hepatic adenoma in
[2]connection with oral contraception use in your
[3]report, don't you?
[4]A Yes.
[5]Q And we'll look at some of those when we
[6]get to the report.
[7]Let me just also ask you about the many
[8]studies that you have cited in your report that
[9]looked at women, and even the control studies that
[10]look at control groups, there are many women in
[11]those studies who have hepatic adenomas who have
[12]never taken oral contraceptives; correct?
[13]A Most of the studies that are available --
[14]and Chang summarizes the series by decades -- the
[15]last series are like 10, 15 years of series, there
[16]are about eight series there, about half of the
[17]patients in those series use oral contraceptives,
[18]so 50 percent of the latest series use them. In
[19]the original series before '85 about 90 percent of
[20]the patients use oral contraceptives.
[21]Q Okay. My only point is that there are
[22]multiple subjects in even those papers that you
[23]did review where women get hepatic adenomas, but
[24]they've never used oral contraceptives; correct?
[25]A Can you repeat that?
  Page 38
[1]Q Yes. Even in those studies that you
[2]cite, there are several women, there are multiple
[3]women who are studied in those papers who have the
[4]condition of a hepatic adenoma but who never used
[5]oral contraceptives; correct?
[6]A Yes. In those series of Chang's that go
[7]from the last 10, 15 years, the ranges go like 41
[8]to like 95 percent of usage, so there's a range in
[9]there and the average is somewhere in between.
[10]Q So in some of the studies you looked at
[11]there were maybe as much as or more than 50
[12]percent of the women who had hepatic adenomas that
[13]had never used oral contraceptives; correct?
[14]A Yes.
[15]Q And then in other studies that number's
[16]different, maybe only 10 percent of the women who
[17]are being studied who had hepatic adenoma had
[18]never used oral contraceptives; correct? There
[19]was a range?
[20]A The smallest numbers were somewhere in
[21]the mid 40s or low 40s.
[22]Q Okay. You were unwilling, back in
[23]November of 2018 when Mr. Haberman was questioning
[24]you, to offer an opinion that Ms. Smith's hepatic
[25]adenomas were caused by oral contraceptives; is
  Page 39
[1]that correct?
[2]A I didn't know that Mr. Haberman was
[3]questioning me.
[4]Q Well, let's just take a quick look at
[5]that. We may mark this as an exhibit, but we'll
[6]see. I'm looking at your deposition, and I'm
[7]looking specifically at page, it's toward the
[8]back, page 74. There are four page numbers listed
[9]per page.
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q Can you see 74?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q I'm sorry. If you look up at the top of
[14]page 73 there you see Mr. Haberman's asking you
[15]questions here. He asked you a few questions
[16]toward the end of your deposition that you might
[17]recall. In any case, if you look down at page 74
[18]you see this question.
[19]"Question: And would you have told her
[20]that her liver tumors, her hepatic adenomas,
[21]were caused by oral contraceptive use?"
[22]And then I object to the question, and
[23]then you say:
[24]"Answer: If it's not stated here then we
[25]cannot conclude that. I don't see any
  Page 40
[1]statement here that I mention that to her."
[2]And then Mr. Haberman asks:
[3]"Question: Okay. Do you recall thinking
[4]at the time that you were treating her that her
[5]liver tumors were caused by her use of oral
[6]contraceptives?"
[7]And again I object, and then you say:
[8]"Answer: No, I don't recall that, no."
[9]Did I read that correctly?
[10]THE WITNESS: You've read all that
[11]correctly.
[12]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[13]Q So my question is: Does that refresh
[14]your recollection that back in November of 2018,
[15]you were not willing to offer an opinion at that
[16]time that Ms. Smith's hepatic adenoma was caused
[17]by oral contraceptives?
[18]A I don't think that that statement --
[19]MR. HABERMAN: Doctor, let me just add an
[20]objection here. I think that mischaracterizes
[21]the nature of the question, which was, did he
[22]have the opinion at the time or did he discuss
[23]causation at the time. So not did he ever have
[24]an opinion one way or the other, so I object to
[25]the characterization of the question.
  Page 41
[1]MR. SUFFERN: Okay. Thanks.
[2]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[3]Q Do you want me to ask another question,
[4]or do you want to try to answer the one that I had
[5]out there? Let me just ask another one.
[6]At the time that you were treating
[7]Ms. Smith, were you thinking that her tumor was
[8]caused by oral contraceptives?
[9]A Well, we have to -- we have to go by
[10]what's written there, Mr. Suffern. If I didn't
[11]write it or discuss it, I mean, you're asking me
[12]to speculate on what I was thinking back then. It
[13]says here that I had not mentioned that to her.
[14]Q The next question Mr. Haberman asked is:
[15]"Do you recall thinking at the time that
[16]you were treating her that her liver tumors
[17]were caused by the use of oral contraceptives?"
[18]And you said: "No, I don't recall that,
[19]no."
[20]Didn't you?
[21]A That's what it says, because if it wasn't
[22]written I wasn't going to commit to saying
[23]something that wasn't true.
[24]Q Okay. And that's all I wanted to get at.
[25]So you weren't prepared to make that opinion then,
  Page 42
[1]but today you are prepared to make that opinion?
[2]A That's not a question about causality,
[3]that's a question about what I was thinking back
[4]then.
[5]Q Okay. You were not thinking back at that
[6]time that her hepatic adenoma was caused by oral
[7]contraceptives; isn't that what you said?
[8]A No. It says that I had -- there was not
[9]a statement, and if there was not a statement I
[10]had not mentioned it to her.
[11]Q Okay. Let me just ask if I'm reading
[12]this correctly.
[13]"Question: Okay. Do you recall thinking
[14]at the time that you were treating her that her
[15]liver tumors were caused by her use of oral
[16]contraceptives?
[17]"Answer: No, I don't recall that, no."
[18]Did I read that correctly?
[19]A You read that correctly.
[20]Q Let's dig into your report. So starting
[21]at page 2 where you identify the records that
[22]you've reviewed, you mentioned the depositions of
[23]Michelle Smith and Susan Smith. But now you've
[24]told us this morning you've read one deposition
[25]that's not identified here, and that would be the
  Page 43
[1]deposition of Lisa Carle; correct?
[2]A Correct. I guess it was not listed there
[3]for some reason.
[4]Q You probably didn't have it at the time
[5]that you did this report. We took those pretty
[6]late in the game.
[7]Let me just ask, are there other
[8]depositions that you've read in this case besides
[9]the Lisa Carle deposition and those that are
[10]identified here? Are there other depositions that
[11]you've read that you haven't listed?
[12]A No. I was trying to find Dr. Solomon's
[13]deposition, but it was never available. I
[14]couldn't find it in any emails, so no, I don't
[15]have anything else.
[16]Q Okay. So you have not read Dr. Solomon's
[17]deposition?
[18]A Not that I know of. I tried to look for
[19]printouts or electronic copies, and I did not see
[20]that.
[21]Q Okay. And it says you reviewed records
[22]from Aker Kasten, M.D., No. 17. Who's that, if
[23]you recall?
[24]A We'll have to look. I don't know who
[25]that is right now.
  Page 44
[1]Q If I tell that you this was a physician
[2]who prescribed oral contraceptives to Michelle
[3]Smith after the date of your surgery, does that
[4]refresh your recollection?
[5]A Not really. I saw some of the records
[6]that had outpatient visits and prescriptions, so
[7]maybe that's the case, but we would have to verify
[8]that.
[9]Q Did you know that Michelle Smith filled a
[10]prescription for oral contraceptives after you had
[11]performed your surgery?
[12]A I did not know that.
[13]Q So underneath the records you identify
[14]you say, "These records are the type usually
[15]relied upon by reviewers such as me. These
[16]records appear to be, in fact, reliable"; correct?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q In your professional practice, you don't
[19]usually review things like depositions or court
[20]papers; correct?
[21]A You mean like routinely?
[22]Q Right.
[23]A No.
[24]Q I mean, all I'm trying to figure out is
[25]when you say these are the type of records you
  Page 45
[1]usually relied upon by reviewers such as me, are
[2]you talking about the medical literature here, or
[3]are you even including -- you know, are you
[4]including the complaint and the depositions as the
[5]types of records usually relied upon by reviewers
[6]such as you?
[7]A Mostly the medical records.
[8]Q Okay. And then you say just below that,
[9]"The above records disclose the following facts in
[10]summary." And you mention she was a 28-year-old
[11]patient, female, who had a ruptured hepatic
[12]adenoma in May of 2013; correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q And then you say, "She had taken oral
[15]contraceptives for 11 years and stopped them in
[16]June of 2013"; correct?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q Are you aware that the first record of an
[19]oral contraceptive prescription that we see in
[20]this case that Ms. Smith filled was not until
[21]August of 2004?
[22]A No, I'm not aware of that. I'm aware of
[23]some of the records that were in all of those
[24]attachments. That's all I have.
[25]Q A little bit further down, you say,
  Page 46
[1]"According to the records and to the information
[2]she gave to me and other physicians, she began
[3]using oral contraceptives somewhere between 2002
[4]and 2003"; correct?
[5]A Yes. And that's what I said at my first
[6]deposition.
[7]Q And I have seen -- I don't dispute the
[8]accuracy that that appears in some of the records
[9]that you had; I've seen them myself.
[10]But my question is: Are you aware, as
[11]you sit here today, that, in fact, Michelle Smith
[12]never filled a prescription for an extended
[13]regimen oral contraceptive until the year 2006?
[14]Are you aware of that?
[15]A I'm not aware of that, and I cannot
[16]comment on the accuracy of that unless I have the
[17]information.
[18]Q Okay. Would it make a difference to your
[19]opinions in the case if she had only been exposed
[20]to those products for a period of time of
[21]approximately seven years as opposed to 11 years?
[22]A Probably not, it's still a pretty long
[23]duration.
[24]Q Okay. And then moving over to the next
[25]page of your report, page 3, you say in the first
  Page 47
[1]paragraph there, "She was a 27-year-old female who
[2]originally presented to Holy Cross Hospital with
[3]elevated serum transaminases (ALT and AST) in the
[4]2,000 to 3,000 range"; correct?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q Those are liver enzymes; correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q And what's the significance of those
[9]elevations in her liver enzymes?
[10]A It reflects a high degree of necrosis, or
[11]cell damage, because of the elevation in the
[12]range.
[13]Q In the next paragraph it says, "On
[14]physical exam there were no abnormal findings."
[15]Of course, by that time you knew that she
[16]already had an adenoma, correct, by this point?
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q And how big was the one that was part of
[19]the section of the liver that you removed? How
[20]big was that adenoma?
[21]A Let's look at the pathology report here.
[22]About 10 centimeters. That's a pathology
[23]measurement, so somewhere in that range. It may
[24]have been smaller or bigger on the imaging.
[25]Q In fact, at the time it ruptured it was
  Page 48
[1]bigger. Do you recall that it reduced in size
[2]after the embolization procedure? We can look at
[3]it.
[4]A The mass was originally 14 centimeters
[5]July 11th.
[6]Q So originally it was 14 centimeters.
[7]We've already established you're not an
[8]OB/GYN, but you're a liver specialist; right?
[9]A Yes, sir.
[10]Q And so I'm guessing -- I know you're a
[11]surgeon -- correct me if I'm wrong -- you have
[12]occasion to palpate patients' livers, don't you?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q Explain to the jury what that means.
[15]A You have to examine the abdomen with a
[16]deep and superficial palpation technique so you
[17]can identify masses and other muscular disorders
[18]or whatever is there.
[19]Q And so palpation techniques, that's just
[20]a way of saying you put your hands on the patient
[21]and feel for them; right?
[22]A Yes, sir.
[23]Q And based on your professional
[24]experience, is an adenoma that's 14 centimeters,
[25]is that something that a physician would be able
  Page 49
[1]to feel when palpating the liver?
[2]A Not necessarily. It depends on the
[3]patient's body habitus. If it's somebody really
[4]obese the liver hides above the rib cage so you
[5]may not feel it. In this case it was documented
[6]that it was not palpable for whatever reason.
[7]Q Okay. Thank you. So may or may not be
[8]palpable, depending on the patient?
[9]A You would expect to be palpate it to some
[10]degree, but in this case it doesn't appear to be
[11]the case.
[12]Q And then you say, "She had more than 10
[13]adenomas noted on imaging. In fact, I counted
[14]over 12, including a very large one in the left
[15]lateral segment that had previously bled";
[16]correct?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q What's the significance of the fact that
[19]she had more than 10 adenomas?
[20]A She had, you know, more things to worry
[21]about. You worry about all of those and the
[22]natural history of all of them and what would
[23]happen to them.
[24]Q Do you recall I asked you a question at
[25]your last deposition about something called
  Page 50
[1]adenomatosis?
[2]A Yes, you did.
[3]Q And what is adenomatosis?
[4]A It pertains to the number of adenomas,
[5]but sometimes there's different definitions, more
[6]than five, more than ten. So I came across
[7]different ones. She probably meets that degree of
[8]criteria.
[9]Q Would you agree that by any definition of
[10]the term adenomatosis she would qualify?
[11]A I would think so.
[12]Q Some authors, in fact, I think it was
[13]Flejou originally -- no, Bioulac-Sage originally
[14]somewhat arbitrarily said people with 10 or more
[15]we'll call that adenomatosis; correct?
[16]A Correct.
[17]Q But other papers say that people who have
[18]more than four quality for the diagnosis; correct?
[19]A Yes. I came across that, too.
[20]Q And one characteristic of patients with
[21]that -- well, let me back up.
[22]Would you characterize adenomatosis as a
[23]disease state?
[24]A I'm not sure what that means.
[25]Q Okay. Well --
  Page 51
[1]A I think it's just a classification. I
[2]don't know that it's linked to particular
[3]etiologies.
[4]Q Would you agree that patients who have
[5]adenomatosis have additional concerns over
[6]patients who have a single hepatocellular adenoma?
[7]A I don't have a strong opinion about that.
[8]Q Okay. Do you believe that as far as
[9]analyzing the risk factors for the development of
[10]adenomatosis on the one hand, and the risk factors
[11]for identifying the development of a singular
[12]hepatocellular adenoma, are different or are they
[13]the same?
[14]A I haven't come across particular links to
[15]why some of them have more than others. In men it
[16]seems like antigens cause multiple tumors.
[17]Otherwise, I don't have a big strong opinion about
[18]why they develop more than others.
[19]Q Would you agree with me that you've seen
[20]papers, including some that you identify in your
[21]report, that say adenomatosis is not associated
[22]with oral contraceptives?
[23]A I would have to look at that. I don't
[24]know where that is in my report.
[25]Q I'm not saying you said that in your
  Page 52
[1]report. I'm just saying that some of the papers
[2]that were identified in your report say that. And
[3]as you sit here today your testimony is you just
[4]don't know, I'd have to show you that?
[5]A Yes, sir.
[6]Q Well, I did ask you a question at your
[7]last deposition about adenomatosis, and if you
[8]want to look at it, it was page 70. And I'm
[9]looking at line 8 -- no, I'm sorry, line 3 on page
[10]70. I say:
[11]"Question: I see." And then I ask: "Do
[12]you -- do you believe that adenomatosis is an
[13]entity that is distinct from hepatic adenoma?"
[14]And then I said, "I can tell by -- I
[15]think I can tell by the look on your face that
[16]that was a bad question" --
[17]You say, "No, no, no."
[18]And then I say -- "or that you didn't
[19]really understand my question."
[20]And then this was your answer:
[21]"Answer: No, it's not about the
[22]question. Sometimes we don't know why somebody
[23]has multiple ones as opposed to having one, so
[24]there must be some distinct entities.
[25]"I mean, if we know the cause of an
  Page 53
[1]adenoma it would make the condition different
[2]from somebody who has adenomatosis that has no
[3]risk factors, so there must be a difference."
[4]Did I read that correctly?
[5]A You read that correctly.
[6]Q So my question for you now is: Do you
[7]still believe, after the additional work that
[8]you've done in this case, that there's a
[9]difference between a patient who has a single
[10]hepatic adenoma and a patient who qualifies for a
[11]diagnosis of adenomatosis?
[12]A I didn't come across any literature, you
[13]know, on that. I don't know that I studied that
[14]specifically. I'm sure there are people with
[15]adenomatosis that have specific risk factors. I
[16]don't know that I can comment any more about that.
[17]Q Do you know whether elevations of ALT and
[18]AST is a common characteristic among patients with
[19]adenomatosis?
[20]A I would not agree with that. That's not
[21]something that I came across.
[22]Q Okay. Again, following a little bit
[23]further here you say a second --
[24]We're talking about the second tumor, the
[25]second adenoma that you took out --
  Page 54
[1]A Resected.
[2]Q -- that you resected; right?
[3]For the jury that means that you
[4]surgically removed; correct?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q A second exophytic type was noted?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q What does exophytic mean?
[9]A It means it's hanging from the edge of
[10]the liver.
[11]Q So it's sort of growing out of the liver
[12]as opposed to into it?
[13]A As opposed to within it.
[14]Q I see. Then let's take a look at the
[15]findings from the pathology report. The first
[16]question is, I'm just curious about the collection
[17]date is noted as September 30th, 2013, and your
[18]surgery was -- oh, it was the same date, right,
[19]September 30th. I see. I just misread that.
[20]So you sent three specimens to pathology;
[21]correct?
[22]A Correct.
[23]Q The left lateral section of her liver
[24]which you removed which contained the large
[25]adenoma; segment 5, which we just discussed; and
  Page 55
[1]then you took a biopsy of her liver tissue that
[2]was not affected by tumors; correct?
[3]A Correct.
[4]Q Okay. And the pathological diagnosis at
[5]the bottom of page 3, says, No. 1, "Left lateral
[6]segment, wedge resection." And it says, "Adjacent
[7]liver, steatohepatitis, grade 1, stage 2,
[8]macrovesicular steatosis, greater than 90 percent,
[9]pending additional special liver stains."
[10]A Correct.
[11]Q What is steatohepatitis?
[12]A Fatty liver and inflammation.
[13]Q Is it correct to say that over 90 percent
[14]of Michelle Smith's liver cells, the ones that
[15]didn't have tumors in them, but over 90 percent of
[16]her liver cells without tumors were infiltrated
[17]with this fat?
[18]A That number refers to fatty change, not
[19]so much the inflammation. It's a steatosis
[20]measurement.
[21]Q And that affected over 90 percent of her
[22]liver?
[23]A Of her hepatocytes.
[24]Q And that's a way of saying liver cells;
[25]correct?
  Page 56
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Okay. And those findings, the
[3]steatohepatitis, that has nothing to do, in your
[4]view, with oral contraceptives; correct?
[5]A The link and the evidence is low. I
[6]wouldn't say nothing to do, to be fair.
[7]Q But you're not opining here in this case
[8]that her steatohepatitis was caused by oral
[9]contraceptives; correct?
[10]A Did you really mean to say that question
[11]or the other way around?
[12]Q I'm sorry, let me think.
[13]My question is: You have not offered an
[14]opinion in this case that oral contraceptives
[15]caused the fatty liver; correct?
[16]A No. We haven't established a link of
[17]oral contraceptives causing fatty liver, no. They
[18]cause other things.
[19]Q Okay. Nor have you established any link,
[20]and it is not your opinion, that oral
[21]contraceptives caused NASH; correct?
[22]A Right.
[23]Q Okay. So there are two risk factors that
[24]Michelle Smith had for the development of hepatic
[25]adenoma that you admit were not caused by oral
  Page 57
[1]contraceptives; correct?
[2]A Which ones would those be?
[3]Q The fatty liver and the NASH.
[4]A There's no evidence that they caused
[5]fatty liver, no. They're highly associated based
[6]of epidemiological things, but we haven't
[7]established that oral contraceptives cause the
[8]liver to become fatty or cause NASH, from what
[9]I've reviewed.
[10]Q All right. And another risk factor for
[11]the development of hepatic adenoma that you
[12]identified in your chart here that we marked as
[13]Exhibit 6 is obesity; correct?
[14]A Correct.
[15]Q And it's certainly not your testimony
[16]that oral contraceptives caused Michelle Smith's
[17]obesity; right?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q Okay. Moving over to the next page, at
[20]the comment section it says, "Comment: Specimens
[21]1 and 2," and then it identifies some special
[22]stains that were ordered. Do you see that?
[23]A Yes.
[24]Q Can you just tell me what the purpose of
[25]each of those stains is?
  Page 58
[1]A They're looking for mutations in the
[2]adenoma.
[3]Q And is the reason you look for mutations
[4]to determine whether the patient is at a
[5]heightened risk for the development of carcinoma?
[6]A Not necessarily. Just to classify them
[7]according to the three different sub types of
[8]adenomas, not just for the cancer aspect.
[9]Q That's one of the reasons, though; right?
[10]One of the reasons you especially are interested
[11]in whether its beta-catenin had mutated is because
[12]ones that have that mutation, the evidence is more
[13]likely that they could become cancerous; correct?
[14]A That's fair.
[15]Q Okay. And hers did not have that
[16]mutation, fortunately; correct?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q Okay. But these other stains -- I mean,
[19]I don't know. Do you know specifically what
[20]reticulin CK7 --
[21]A Those are looking for like different
[22]fibrosis markers and, you know, they're not
[23]necessarily going to classify the adenomas. They
[24]were done; there's immunohistochemistry.
[25]Q Do you order what types of stains should
  Page 59
[1]be done, or is that the pathologist?
[2]A The pathologist.
[3]Q Okay. Did you run across in your work in
[4]this case any papers that discussed special
[5]pathological immunohistochemical staining for
[6]estrogen receptor status?
[7]A I don't recall.
[8]Q Do you know what that is?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q Can you tell us what it is?
[11]A Well, different tissues have receptors
[12]for estrogen and for estrogen breast tissue and
[13]tumors.
[14]Q And are you aware of whether there's a
[15]way to test the pathology specimens to see if they
[16]are receptive to estrogen, or progestogen for that
[17]matter?
[18]A I'm sure there's a way.
[19]Q But that wasn't done here; correct?
[20]A It doesn't look like.
[21]Q Could that have been done?
[22]A Sure.
[23]Q Could it still be done?
[24]A We would have to see if the specimens
[25]that are there allow that, because there's no like
  Page 60
[1]fresh tissue.
[2]Q Would it be important to your opinions in
[3]this case if special stains were done on her
[4]adenoma tissues that showed they were estrogen
[5]receptor negative? Would that affect your
[6]opinions in this case?
[7]A I don't think so.
[8]Q How about if they were estrogen receptor
[9]positive, would that affect your opinions in this
[10]case?
[11]A No.
[12]Q It wouldn't matter one way or another?
[13]A I don't think so.
[14]Q Why not?
[15]A Because those are new tests and there's
[16]probably not enough information, and I haven't
[17]seen the literature that talks about that in terms
[18]of how the tumors are going to behave or respond
[19]to withdrawal of drugs, so I don't have much to
[20]say about that.
[21]Q Okay. Going through the addendum
[22]diagnosis here -- so the addendum diagnosis here,
[23]am I correct in my belief that this is what the
[24]pathologist fills in after getting back the
[25]results of some of these stains that were done?
  Page 61
[1]A Yes.
[2]Q Okay. And so after staining now, the --
[3]and it's the pathologist who characterizes this as
[4]now the steatohepatitis is called grade 1-2,
[5]stage 2, whereas before the pathology it was noted
[6]as grade 1, stage 2, now it's grade 1-2, stage 2.
[7]Do you see that?
[8]A You're at the top of the page?
[9]Q Well, at the top of the page the segment
[10]4 biopsy says, "Steatohepatitis, grade 1,
[11]stage 2"; correct?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q But then the addendum diagnosis says,
[14]"Block 1E: Additional special stains showing
[15]steatohepatitis grade 1-2, stage 2." See how it's
[16]characterized as grade 1-2 in the addendum, but up
[17]top it's just characterized as grade 1, stage 2?
[18]A I see that.
[19]Q Is there a difference?
[20]A There is a slight grade change in terms
[21]of the degree of inflammation, which is what grade
[22]pertains to. Grade pertains to inflammation;
[23]stages pertain to fibrosis scores.
[24]Q And so after the special stains were done
[25]the -- and the steatohepatitis, that refers to the
  Page 62
[1]fatty liver, correct, the fat?
[2]A If it mentions steatohepatitis it
[3]pertains to fatty liver and some degree of
[4]inflammation.
[5]Q Okay. I guess from a layperson's
[6]perspective, it was worse -- it was determined to
[7]be worse after the special stains were done than
[8]it appeared on gross examination; is that correct?
[9]A I wouldn't say it that way. There was a
[10]mild variation. The grades of inflammation seem
[11]to be very mild.
[12]Q Okay. Make sure I understand. A mild
[13]degree of inflammation, but still over 90 percent
[14]of the hepatocytes were affected by the fat;
[15]correct?
[16]A Yes, sir.
[17]Q And then down further it looks like
[18]there's a second addendum; is that right?
[19]A Yes.
[20]Q 2/04/14. So do you know why there's a
[21]second addendum?
[22]A It looks like the chief of pathology that
[23]finally looked at the slides, Mr. Suffern, and
[24]then they added another addendum.
[25]Q Okay. So you think it was -- it wasn't
  Page 63
[1]that there was additional staining, it was just
[2]that somebody else looked at them and was giving a
[3]further report? Is that your best guess at what
[4]happened there?
[5]A Right. And the addendum doesn't say
[6]much. It says that they documented the stains.
[7]Q Yeah, that's what I was kind of trying to
[8]figure out. I don't see really any report or
[9]comment on the second addendum, and that was
[10]really what I was going for. I'm wondering if I'm
[11]missing something, or if this is all we have.
[12]A I don't know. It may be a formality.
[13]Maybe it's part of their documentation, billing.
[14]I'm not sure.
[15]Q Looking under the gross description up
[16]over on to the next page, top of page 5 it says,
[17]"1C) Nodal to capsule." Do you know, were the
[18]hepatocellular adenomas that you removed from
[19]Ms. Smith, were they encapsulated?
[20]A What part of the page are you on?
[21]Q On page 5 that begins with "...margin is
[22]inked black." Then there are numbers below that.
[23]1C is describing part of what they looked at. I
[24]think it says, "Nodal to capsule."
[25]My question is: Were these adenomas
  Page 64
[1]encapsulated?
[2]A I don't know if I can answer that
[3]question. It was a single mass, from what I can
[4]remember.
[5]Q Okay.
[6]A I don't know that I can answer that
[7]accurately.
[8]Q And you reported earlier that when you
[9]were actually in there doing the surgery, that you
[10]personally were able to count more than 12
[11]adenomas; correct?
[12]A That's based on my review of the imaging,
[13]not in the operating room.
[14]Q I see.
[15]You removed the portion of her liver that
[16]had the really big one, and then you also removed
[17]one that was approximately 5 centimeters; correct?
[18]A Yes.
[19]Q Would you say that the remaining adenomas
[20]that you found, more than 12 -- I guess your last
[21]answer, I'm sorry, I have to back up a little.
[22]Is there imaging that goes on during the
[23]operation?
[24]A It would have to be reflected in the
[25]operative note if we did an ultrasound or not.
  Page 65
[1]Not routinely. In this case, I mean, we weren't
[2]going to be operating on the 10 tumors, so if no
[3]ultrasound was done, then it wasn't done.
[4]Q Okay. I'm just trying to get a sense of
[5]when you're in there operating, you knew going in
[6]that you wanted to remove this large one that had
[7]bled; right? That was the purpose of the surgery;
[8]right?
[9]A Correct.
[10]Q The second one that you removed, the 5
[11]centimeter, did you know you were going to remove
[12]that one prior to surgery, or did you discover
[13]that as another particularly large one and decide
[14]to remove it while you were doing the surgery?
[15]A I would have to review if we were going
[16]to plan to remove it, but we already knew about it
[17]before. So you asked me the question -- two
[18]different questions in one.
[19]Once we were in there we made the
[20]decision to remove it based on the risk factors,
[21]because it was big and outside and it would have
[22]caused trouble.
[23]Q And I've seen literature that suggests
[24]generally that surgery is called for for tumors
[25]that are about 5 centimeters. Is that kind of
  Page 66
[1]what your cutoff is?
[2]A Yes, sir.
[3]Q Do you know if she had any others that
[4]were sort of approaching that? I mean, were the
[5]other ones you saw, were they much smaller?
[6]Let me ask it this way: If she had a
[7]4-centimeter tumor in there as well, would you
[8]have seen that, do you think?
[9]A I would have known about it from the
[10]imaging.
[11]Q So if another 4-centimeter tumor existed
[12]at that time, it's your opinion that you would
[13]have known about it from the imaging?
[14]A Yes, sir.
[15]MR. SUFFERN: Can we take a quick break.
[16](Recess taken from 9:26 a.m. to
[17]9:35 a.m.)
[18]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[19]Q Back on the record after our break,
[20]Doctor. I'm on page 5 of your report. Just below
[21]where it says, "This is the end of the pathology
[22]report." One of the things that you confirmed
[23]through the pathology was that she qualifies for a
[24]diagnosis of this condition called NASH; correct?
[25]A She has low grade inflammation, so I
  Page 67
[1]don't know to what degree the liver specialist
[2]would classify her, but there is a grading and a
[3]staging that was given there.
[4]Q In fact, it was even discussed with her
[5]whether she would participate in a clinical trial
[6]for a drug that you were an investigator on that
[7]was for the treatment of NASH; correct?
[8]A Yes. But we had not screened her for
[9]that or made decisions whether she qualified based
[10]on the degree of NASH. So it was just mentioned
[11]to her, yes, sir.
[12]Q I mean, there were several communications
[13]between your office and her about whether she
[14]wanted to participate in that trial; right?
[15]A Right. Again, no particular commitment
[16]to whether she would qualify based on the biopsy.
[17]I mean, that would have to be interpreted
[18]according to the conclusion criteria of the study
[19]and all that.
[20]Q You referred to the liver specialist.
[21]That's something that somebody other than you
[22]would decide?
[23]A Well, the degree of pathology --
[24]inflammation there may have different significance
[25]to the hepatologist, but that study would have a
  Page 68
[1]specific criteria to include a patient or not on a
[2]study based on the degree.
[3]Q So you state here that you re-evaluated
[4]her in March of 2015, about 17 months later. That
[5]means about 17 months after her surgery -- 17
[6]months after your first post-op evaluation;
[7]correct?
[8]A Correct.
[9]Q And you say, "All her other hepatic
[10]adenomas had disappeared off oral contraceptives.
[11]I personally reviewed the CT scan images";
[12]correct?
[13]A Correct.
[14]Q So at least as of March of 2015,
[15]approximately 17 months after her surgery, maybe
[16]18, you had personally determined that all of her
[17]other hepatic adenomas had disappeared; correct?
[18]A Yeah, according to how the study was read
[19]and according to my review.
[20]Q And that fact is important to your
[21]causation opinions in this case, isn't it?
[22]A Absolutely not.
[23]Q Why not?
[24]A Because causality is not linked to the
[25]stability or progression or regression of
  Page 69
[1]adenomas. They're not linked. If you smoke and
[2]develop lung cancer, your cancer is not going to
[3]go away after you quit smoking. That's an
[4]example. Most adenomas don't shrink; they stay
[5]stable. There's no link between causality and
[6]what's going to happen to them off the drugs.
[7]Q Okay. And so just kind of moving ahead
[8]to your second opinion -- and we'll come back in a
[9]second, but if you go over to page 8, Roman
[10]numeral II where you have your second opinion
[11]noted. Do you see that? It's just above the two
[12]images on page 8. Do you see Roman numeral II?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q You say, "It is my professional opinion
[15]that the plaintiff developed a very large hepatic
[16]adenoma and innumerable other ones as a result of
[17]longstanding use of oral contraceptive use."
[18]That's your causation opinion; right?
[19]You're saying that oral contraceptives caused
[20]Michelle Smith's hepatic adenoma in this case;
[21]correct?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q And just below that you say, "The
[24]literature that I reviewed supports my opinion."
[25]And we're going to get to some of the literature
  Page 70
[1]in a minute. But you also say, "In addition, the
[2]multiple adenomas that she developed as a
[3]consequence of chronic OC use had regressed after
[4]discontinuation of the oral contraceptives."
[5]Did I read that correctly?
[6]A You read that correctly.
[7]Q When I first read that I took that to
[8]mean that the fact that they had regressed
[9]supported your opinion about causation in this
[10]case. Am I wrong about that?
[11]A No, you're not wrong. It was written
[12]that way. But to be fair, they could have stayed
[13]stable or regressed or possibly not get better.
[14]Q Okay. So at the end of the day the fact
[15]that they regressed, that some of them regressed,
[16]that doesn't matter one way or the other to your
[17]causation opinion, or does it? That's what I'm
[18]trying to understand.
[19]A It should not be interpreted as it was
[20]highly, you know, that it was -- the regression
[21]shouldn't have been a strong point in the
[22]causality.
[23]Q Okay.
[24]A And that's based on further literature
[25]that I ran across. Remember when you deposed me
  Page 71
[1]the first time, I didn't have all the facts about
[2]how all these things behave and I told you that.
[3]Q And part of what I'm trying to understand
[4]is what's changed between then and now. And it
[5]sounds to me like what's really changed is that
[6]you've read and considered more literature; is
[7]that fair?
[8]A Yes. That's one of the facts.
[9]Q And what else has changed between
[10]November 29th and today? You've read more
[11]literature. What else has changed?
[12]A Nothing. I continue to see patients with
[13]adenomas and gain experience. That's sort of
[14]nonscientific information.
[15]Q Okay. You also note -- now I'm going
[16]back to page 5 where we were just at the end of
[17]the pathology report. You also note that her
[18]background steatohepatitis also improved since the
[19]last exam; correct?
[20]A According to the imaging, right. The
[21]imaging mentions that.
[22]Q Okay. Some of the tumors that you saw
[23]had either shrunk or gone away; correct?
[24]A Correct.
[25]Q And it's the tumors that you're competent
  Page 72
[1]saying were caused by oral contraceptives;
[2]correct?
[3]A Right.
[4]Q But then you also note that the
[5]background steatohepatitis improved after your
[6]surgery; correct?
[7]A Correct.
[8]Q But you don't attribute the
[9]steatohepatitis to the oral contraceptives?
[10]A Correct.
[11]Q So might there have been something about
[12]the removal of the large tumors in and of itself
[13]that caused both the other tumors to regress and
[14]the steatosis to regress?
[15]A No. She lost weight; she lost weight
[16]subsequently. We would have to quantify how much
[17]weight she lost, but I think that happened.
[18]Q Okay. Now, you're aware that in January
[19]of 2017 there was some imaging that identified a
[20]tumor that was approximately 4 centimeters large?
[21]A I think it was about 3 and a half
[22]centimeters. I'm aware of that.
[23]Q The next document I'm going to mark as an
[24]exhibit has been Bates numbered 25SMITH00020
[25]through 22. I'll mark this as Exhibit 7.
  Page 73
[1](Exhibit No. 7 was marked for purposes of
[2]identification.)
[3]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[4]Q And I'm just going to ask you a few
[5]questions about this, Doctor. And this is up at
[6]the top, it says exam date 1/06/17; correct?
[7]A Yes. There's multiple reports here in
[8]this exhibit.
[9]Q Right.
[10]A There's an ultrasound, an MRI.
[11]Q So the first page, 25SMITH00020, that's a
[12]report of an ultrasound; correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q And it says, "Liver measures 16 by
[15]1 centimeter. Well circumscribed hypodense mass
[16]in the right lobe liver measuring 4 by 3.7 by
[17]4 centimeters"; correct?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q Then if you look at the next page,
[20]25SMITH00021, this one says, "Date of exam
[21]1/20/2017." Do you see that up at the top?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q This is an MRI report; correct?
[24]A Yes.
[25]Q And underneath findings down toward the
  Page 74
[1]bottom, it says, "Well circumscribed, oval-shaped,
[2]slightly irregular mass noted in the posterior
[3]segment of the right lobe of the liver. This
[4]lesion measures up to approximately 3.6 by 3.0
[5]centimeters"; correct?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q And then the next page, 25SMITH00022, it
[8]looks like that's just a continuation of this MRI
[9]report; right?
[10]A Yes. It is a two-page report.
[11]Q And then it also notes down the middle of
[12]that page "...an additional small 0.8 centimeter
[13]lesion within the right anterior hepatic dome";
[14]correct?
[15]A Correct.
[16]Q Now, first question I have about the
[17]3.6 by 3 centimeter lesion that's reported in the
[18]MRI, is that the same as the lesion that was
[19]reported on the previous page measuring
[20]4 by 3.7 by 4 centimeters on the ultrasound?
[21]A It should be. I mean, it's kind of
[22]consistent.
[23]Q You're assuming it is?
[24]A I'm assuming it is. I don't know that
[25]it's that important.
  Page 75
[1]Q It wouldn't be that unusual to have an
[2]ultrasound measure something and have an MRI
[3]report a slightly different size based on exactly
[4]the same tumor; right?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q And they're both in the right lobe;
[7]right?
[8]A Yes.
[9]Q Would you have seen a tumor that large if
[10]it had existed in Michelle Smith's right lobe of
[11]her liver when you had your diagnostic studies
[12]done before the surgery?
[13]A She had different studies. I think she
[14]had a CAT scan before. It's possible that the
[15]tumor was not seen. These tumors in a CT could
[16]remain completely hidden, and it's possible
[17]that -- there's two possibilities: that it was
[18]there on the CAT scan and there's a possibility
[19]they could have grown since. I think both are
[20]possible.
[21]It depends, because the studies are
[22]different, and definitely some of these things can
[23]hide in particular tests. You may not see a big
[24]tumor on a CAT scan, and you have to go to the
[25]next test to see. That's very possible.
  Page 76
[1]Q And a third possibility is that it may
[2]not even have been there at all at the time of
[3]your surgery; correct?
[4]A That's possible. It's really hard to
[5]know because there were so many. I mean, that
[6]would require an extensive evaluation of where
[7]that is now and what was there before.
[8]Q Okay. And so I guess my whole point
[9]about it is that you just don't know, sitting here
[10]today, one way or the other whether this tumor
[11]that's reported in this document, Exhibit 7, you
[12]just don't know if that was there at all when you
[13]performed your surgery on Michelle Smith; correct?
[14]A Correct.
[15]Q And it's your testimony that that doesn't
[16]matter one way or another as far as your opinion
[17]that her hepatic adenomas in this case were caused
[18]by oral contraceptives?
[19]A The presence of this tumor, I think it's
[20]pretty relevant in everything that we've discussed
[21]before. That's what I would say.
[22]Q Okay. But if it hadn't been there at all
[23]at the time of your surgery, would that be
[24]relevant to whether it was caused by oral
[25]contraceptives?
  Page 77
[1]A Not so much, because you can develop new
[2]tumors or you can develop focal nodular
[3]hyperplasias in women which are not related to
[4]oral contraceptives so much. And we really
[5]haven't characterized this tumor yet; other
[6]studies may need to be done to really pinpoint
[7]what it is.
[8]Q But I want to make sure I understand
[9]this. And let's start with your last point. On
[10]the last page here, 25SMITH00022, the technician
[11]who read the MRI --
[12]A The radiologist.
[13]Q The radiologist, there you go. Thank
[14]you.
[15]He says, he specifically says, "I don't
[16]know if this is a hepatic adenoma or a focal
[17]nodular hyperplasia"; right?
[18]A Yes, sir.
[19]Q You just testified that focal nodular
[20]hyperplasia -- can we call that FNH?
[21]A Yes.
[22]Q FNH is not associated with oral
[23]contraceptives; correct?
[24]A Not highly. We sometimes see them in
[25]people who have been taking them. They don't have
  Page 78
[1]strong link like adenomas do.
[2]Q And what would have to be done to
[3]determine whether that was a hepatic adenoma or an
[4]FNH?
[5]A Occasionally the MRI could be diagnostic.
[6]It depends on how the sequences are done and what
[7]it shows. You can do nuclear medicine scans, you
[8]can do biopsies, there are other ways to pinpoint
[9]it, or sometimes the MRI can tell you.
[10]Q And did you personally look at this film?
[11]A No, I just got the report that probably
[12]came a few months ago.
[13]Q And if it were, in fact, a hepatocellular
[14]adenoma as opposed to an FNH, and if, in fact,
[15]that hepatocellular adenoma had not existed at the
[16]time of your surgery, would that in any way affect
[17]your causation opinions in this case?
[18]A I don't think so. I don't think it
[19]would.
[20]Q And that's the part I really need to
[21]understand why. So she had been -- it's your
[22]understanding that Michelle Smith never took
[23]another oral contraceptive after her large
[24]hepatocellular adenoma started to bleed; correct?
[25]A I don't think I've commented about that.
  Page 79
[1]I haven't rendered an opinion about that.
[2]Q Well, she says that in her deposition. I
[3]know there's a lot of stuff. Assuming that's
[4]true -- let's assume that that's true. If it's
[5]true that Michelle Smith never took another oral
[6]contraceptive after June of 2013, and if this
[7]lesion that we're looking at in Exhibit 7 was a
[8]new hepatocellular adenoma, could that one have
[9]still been caused by oral contraceptives after
[10]having been off of oral contraceptives for four
[11]years?
[12]A That's speculative. Anything's possible.
[13]I don't think I would comment about that. If it
[14]wasn't there and then it came years later, I guess
[15]it's unlikely.
[16]Q Unlikely that it would be caused by it?
[17]A Yes. You know, we're just making a lot
[18]of assumptions.
[19]Q Okay. And you've done nothing to
[20]determine, in connection with your work as an
[21]expert in this case, whether this lesion that was
[22]reported on Exhibit 7 was existing at the time of
[23]your surgery or not. You just don't know one way
[24]or the other; correct?
[25]A Correct. I haven't looked at these films
  Page 80
[1]or compared them, that's correct.
[2]Q Okay. Nor have you done anything to
[3]determine whether it was, in fact, a
[4]hepatocellular adenoma versus a focal nodular
[5]hyperplasia; correct?
[6]A Right. Because she's not under my care.
[7]Q What about all those other lesions that
[8]you saw? In your report you mentioned -- or you
[9]actually give us a picture of all the lesions that
[10]were there at the time of your surgery. It's on
[11]page 8. You have a picture of all the lesions
[12]that were there at the time of the surgery;
[13]correct?
[14]A Correct.
[15]Q Versus those that had resolved in March
[16]of 2015; correct?
[17]A Correct.
[18]Q And we saw that earlier in your
[19]report -- we had just read that the report of
[20]Elliot Wasser -- I'm sorry. In your report you
[21]say, "I personally reviewed the CT scan images.
[22]All her other hepatic adenomas had disappeared off
[23]oral contraceptives;" correct?
[24]A Yes. From what we could see in the
[25]images, none were seen.
  Page 81
[1]Q Okay. Now I'm just trying to understand
[2]the relationship between that statement in your
[3]report and this one that we're looking at in
[4]Exhibit 7. And I think now you've come to the
[5]conclusion that you just don't know one way or
[6]another whether all of her lesions had resolved or
[7]not, because you don't know whether this one
[8]reported in Exhibit 7 was new or whether it
[9]existed at the time of the surgery; correct?
[10]A Can you repeat that, Mr. Suffern?
[11]Q Sure. Maybe a better of asking it is:
[12]When you say, "All her other hepatic adenomas had
[13]disappeared off oral contraceptives," that doesn't
[14]mean that there might not have been some still
[15]there; is that right? You just couldn't see them,
[16]maybe?
[17]A I'm quoting the -- where are you at?
[18]What page?
[19]Q Page 5, just under the statement that
[20]says, "This is the end of the pathology report."
[21]You say, "All her other hepatic adenomas had
[22]disappeared off oral contraceptives."
[23]A Right. It's based on my review and based
[24]on what was -- how the study was read.
[25]Q And so my question for you here today is:
  Page 82
[1]In light of Exhibit 7, this lesion that was
[2]described in January of 2017, can you state
[3]definitively that all of her other hepatic
[4]adenomas had disappeared, or do you not know?
[5]A You're not asking about this tumor,
[6]you're asking about the other ones?
[7]Q Well, the relationship between the two is
[8]this tumor described in Exhibit 7, I think you
[9]told us a few questions ago that you didn't know
[10]if it was there or not at the time of her surgery.
[11]A We established there were three
[12]possibilities.
[13]Q Right. And so -- let's just leave it at
[14]that.
[15]But my question, my follow-up on it is
[16]this: All the other lesions that you saw at the
[17]time of her surgery, there were only two of those
[18]that were subjected to pathological analysis,
[19]correct, the pathology analysis; correct?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q Only two of them?
[22]A Yes.
[23]Q We know there were at least 10 more,
[24]right, because you counted more than 12; correct?
[25]A Correct.
  Page 83
[1]Q Do you know whether those were hepatic
[2]adenomas at all versus FNHs?
[3]A We would have to look at the report of
[4]the imaging to confirm that, how it was read.
[5]Q But did you know that when you wrote your
[6]report?
[7]A If you want me to be accurate, we have to
[8]look at the report.
[9]Q Okay. So your answer today is you don't
[10]know?
[11]A No, that's not my answer. How about if
[12]you give me the report so I can answer?
[13]Q I don't have the report.
[14]A Okay. You don't have it.
[15]Q My question for you today is: As you sit
[16]here today, do you know whether all of the lesions
[17]you identified that you saw at the time of your
[18]surgery in the imaging, do you know, as you sit
[19]here today, whether those were truly
[20]hepatocellular adenomas or whether they were
[21]something else?
[22]A You go by my documentation of the history
[23]of what's in the medical record, what's in my
[24]operative note, and they were all considered to be
[25]adenomas. There's no mention that she had
  Page 84
[1]intermingling FNHs in there. That's my answer.
[2]Q And how accurate is -- well, before the
[3]surgery you just had a CT scan that you were
[4]reporting on; correct?
[5]A Correct.
[6]Q And is it even possible to differentiate
[7]definitely between a hepatocellular adenoma and a
[8]focal nodular hyperplasia based on CT results?
[9]A Anything is possible. It could be a
[10]mixture diagnosis.
[11]Q In your professional opinion, is that
[12]diagnosis of HCA versus FNH one that generally
[13]requires more than a CT scan?
[14]A It depends. It depends. I mean,
[15]sometimes you have a CT scan and you have other
[16]tests, you have a biopsy, so it depends.
[17]Q Okay.
[18]A There's no evidence in the record that we
[19]were thinking that there were other lesions there.
[20]Anything's possible, Mr. Suffern.
[21]Q Right. And I just want to know if you
[22]know or not.
[23]A We went by the diagnosis, and it's
[24]established that she had multiple adenomas based
[25]on operative findings, imaging, and other data.
  Page 85
[1]Q But you know, based on your professional
[2]experience, that oftentimes you can't really
[3]definitively make that diagnosis unless you have
[4]tissue to analyze with pathology; correct?
[5]A That's one possibility. Sometimes the
[6]MRIs can give you the diagnosis.
[7]Q What's the gold standard?
[8]A No, we don't biopsy every patient with
[9]adenomas. Also, plus some patients may have big
[10]tumors that are going to be operated anyway, so
[11]you do it according to the imaging, clinical
[12]findings, and what the patient needs.
[13]Q Let's look at page 6 of your report where
[14]you start talking about the labels of the drugs.
[15]Okay. You identify the ones you looked at. She
[16]wasn't taking oral contraceptives in 2017;
[17]correct? I think you already told us you don't
[18]know; right?
[19]A I don't know what she's doing now.
[20]Q All right. Why did you look at the 2017
[21]label?
[22]A Because it was available. It's pertinent
[23]to see how the company has changed labels.
[24]Q Down under professional opinion you say,
[25]"It is my professional opinion that Teva developed
  Page 86
[1]inadequate warning of the drugs Seasonique and
[2]Seasonale as to the risk of developing hepatic
[3]adenomas."
[4]Do you see that?
[5]A I see that.
[6]Q My first question is: Do you believe
[7]that Teva developed that warning?
[8]A Teva's responsible for the label.
[9]Q That's a different question. My question
[10]is: Do you believe that Teva developed it?
[11]A I think --
[12]MR. HABERMAN: Asked and answered.
[13]THE WITNESS: Pardon?
[14]MR. SUFFERN: He said, "Asked and
[15]answered." He liked your previous answer where
[16]you said Teva's responsible. I'm not disputing
[17]that.
[18]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[19]Q You said in your report that Teva
[20]developed inadequate warnings, and my question to
[21]you, sir, is simply: Do you believe that Teva
[22]developed the warning language that you've quoted
[23]in your report?
[24]A I think the FDA develops the warnings,
[25]and I think that's how it is. And the company's
  Page 87
[1]responsible for the label, and they, I guess,
[2]incorporate together in establishing those labels
[3]to some degree.
[4]Q And when you say that the warnings were
[5]inadequate, are you limiting your opinion about
[6]the inadequate warnings to the warning section of
[7]the label that you've quoted here in your report?
[8]A As opposed to what else?
[9]Q As opposed to all the other information
[10]in the patient package insert and in the
[11]physician's prescribing information.
[12]A Just in the section of the adenoma or the
[13]liver section.
[14]Q So you're not talking about the
[15]contraindication section; correct?
[16]A The contraindication section may contain
[17]something about adenomas, thromboembolism, things
[18]like that. I would have to look at that.
[19]Q That's the problem. We're here to
[20]understand what your opinions are, Dr. Alsina.
[21]A Yes.
[22]Q And my question is: Do you have an
[23]opinion about the adequacy of the labeling in the
[24]contraindication section, or is it just the
[25]warnings that you've identified here that you're
  Page 88
[1]claiming to be inadequate?
[2]A I need to look at the package insert. I
[3]mean, I think that's fair.
[4]Q Okay. So you don't have an opinion one
[5]way or the other, as you sit here today, about
[6]whether the contraindication section --
[7]A As to what section I'm referring to?
[8]Q No, no, no. Sir, my question is this:
[9]As you sit here today, do you have an opinion
[10]about the adequacy of the contraindication section
[11]of the Seasonique and Seasonale labeling?
[12]A I don't know where all the things are in
[13]the label right now, so I'm having trouble
[14]answering your question.
[15]Q Well, you know that the stuff that you
[16]quoted is in the warnings section; correct?
[17]A It could be in the warnings; it could be
[18]in the contraindication section.
[19]Q So let me back up. You don't know
[20]whether the sections that you quoted, whether
[21]that's in the warnings or whether it's --
[22]A Right now, I think I have -- I should be
[23]able to review that, but I can't tell you right
[24]now.
[25]Q Let me --
  Page 89
[1]A I gave you information and then I don't
[2]get to review anything on my side.
[3]Q If I can refer you to your deposition
[4]from the last time. If you'll look at page 19,
[5]please. And I was asking you about the warnings
[6]section of the label on page 18. And at the
[7]bottom of page 18 I asked you to -- well, first I
[8]asked you about the contraindication section at
[9]line 14 of page 18. And then I quote the
[10]warnings.
[11]Do you see at the bottom of page 18,
[12]starting at line 14, you say, "There's a
[13]subsection here Seasonale is contraindicated" --
[14]I'm sorry.
[15]It says, "An estimate of the attributable
[16]risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 oral contraceptive
[17]users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause
[18]death through intra-abdominal" -- I'm sorry,
[19]that's not what I wanted to ask you about.
[20]I wanted to ask you about on page 20,
[21]line 4, I say:
[22]"Thank you. But the question was whether
[23]you know, as you sit here today, that there's
[24]anything inaccurate about what you just read?
[25]Not whether you would need additional research
  Page 90
[1]to confirm it, but, as you sit here today, do
[2]you know whether there's anything in that
[3]section that is not accurate?"
[4]And this was your answer:
[5]"Answer: Well, to be able to know more
[6]about the incident risks here, I mean if I'm
[7]going to make an opinion about the accuracy I
[8]would have to know if that's true or not. So
[9]some of the other statements are accurate, the
[10]hemorrhage is accurate, the contraindication
[11]statement would be valid that you shouldn't
[12]give this to somebody who already has a tumor.
[13]And the risks of liver cancer are rare. You
[14]know, we've seen some of these very rare
[15]transformations, but I don't know that I'm
[16]going to be able to answer the risk, the
[17]incident risk."
[18]Did I read that correctly?
[19]A You did.
[20]Q So do you still agree, as you sit here
[21]today, that the incident rate, the 3.3 per
[22]100,000, that you don't know whether that's
[23]accurate or not?
[24]A No. We know where that came from,
[25]Mr. Suffern. That's in the label. We know where
  Page 91
[1]it came from. And we know what the baseline was
[2]in nonusers, which was .1.
[3]Q Right.
[4]A .1 goes to 3 to 4 nonusers to users.
[5]It's the same number that goes from 1 to 30
[6]million. Okay? It's a 10-fold analysis, 100,000
[7]patients or a million patients, so it's reported
[8]either way.
[9]So what the label doesn't say is what the
[10]baseline was on the patients that were nonusers.
[11]It just tells you that it was 3 to 4 per 100,000.
[12]It doesn't tell you there's was a 30-fold
[13]increase.
[14]MR. SUFFERN: I'm going to respectfully
[15]move to strike that because I don't think it
[16]was responsive to my question.
[17]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[18]Q My question is this: Is it that the
[19]incidence rate -- do you still believe, as you sit
[20]here today, that you don't know whether or not
[21]that's an accurate statement of the incidence
[22]rate?
[23]A What statement?
[24]Q 3.3 per 100,000 users.
[25]A It's in the literature. I'm not sure
  Page 92
[1]what you're asking.
[2]Q Do you know if that's an accurate
[3]statement or not?
[4]A It's an accurate statement based on the
[5]literature at that point. I don't understand your
[6]question.
[7]Q Are you aware of any more recent or
[8]different literature that reports what you would
[9]view as a more accurate incidence rate?
[10]A Well, there's different ways to interpret
[11]that study. It's the Rooks study from JAMA and it
[12]says that the risk increases 500 fold after so
[13]many years of use. It's the same article.
[14]Q The same article that says what you just
[15]said is the study that reported the incidence rate
[16]that's actually used in the labeling and that's
[17]the Rooks study; correct?
[18]A The Rooks study is that study, correct.
[19]Q And it reports the 3.3 per 100,000
[20]incidence rate; correct?
[21]A Yes.
[22]Q And it's the very same study, Rooks, that
[23]talks about the different relative risks as
[24]compared to nonusers that you also described;
[25]correct?
  Page 93
[1]A Yeah. I don't think the label talks
[2]about nonusers or the increases after usage or the
[3]risk of using it for a long time or the, you know,
[4]quantified risk. It just gives you that number of
[5]incidents, yes, like you mentioned.
[6]Q Right. And it's the Rooks study that
[7]does both of those things; correct?
[8]A I think so.
[9]Q Okay.
[10]A I can look in here and see.
[11]Q We'll get to it. I'm going to show you
[12]Rooks in a bit.
[13]So let's go back to your report here
[14]where you say, "Teva developed inadequate
[15]warnings."
[16]What standard are you using to judge the
[17]adequacy of the warnings?
[18]A There should be data that's, you know,
[19]not 20 to 30 years old, and that it tells the
[20]patient what the risks are compared to nonusers,
[21]and it should be clear.
[22]Q You think that the package insert should
[23]be telling the patient something about the risk
[24]compared to nonusers or the prescribing physician?
[25]A Both. The package inserts are for the
  Page 94
[1]patients, too.
[2]Q Well, you know there's a different
[3]package insert for the patients for oral
[4]contraceptives, or do you know that federal law
[5]requires a patient package insert for oral
[6]contraceptives?
[7]A Yeah. Every prescription has one.
[8]Q For oral contraceptives?
[9]A For any drug.
[10]Q You think every drug has a patient
[11]package insert that's required by FDA?
[12]A Every drug that's not an over-the-counter
[13]drug has a package insert attached to it that the
[14]patient gets. When you get a prescription,
[15]there's a package insert inside. Those are
[16]FDA-created package inserts that are provided by
[17]the company.
[18]Q So again, I'm not sure -- I want to know
[19]by what standard you're judging the adequacy. One
[20]thing you said, I think, is -- one thing you said
[21]is -- well, I guess I just have to respectfully
[22]move to strike your last answer to that question.
[23]You said it's based on outdated data. Is that the
[24]standard, that the data needs to be newer?
[25]A Well, I mean, Teva doesn't --
  Page 95
[1]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[2]THE WITNESS: Teva doesn't have much
[3]knowledge of what the rates of adenomas are
[4]with oral contraceptives. It doesn't sound
[5]like they have that information and that they
[6]haven't accepted any control studies or -- you
[7]know, Mrs. Carle said that they didn't have
[8]much information on what oral contraceptives
[9]do, including their products.
[10]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[11]Q Are you basing any comments you have
[12]today about what Teva had, what data Teva had
[13]based -- is it based solely on Ms. Carle's
[14]deposition?
[15]A I don't have any other sources.
[16]Q Okay. Do you know if the warning section
[17]for Teva's combination oral contraceptive products
[18]that you cite here are essentially the same as the
[19]warning section regarding hepatic adenoma on every
[20]single combination oral contraceptive that's sold
[21]in this country? Do you know that?
[22]A I haven't looked at them, but it's a
[23]class label, so I would think that it would be
[24]similar.
[25]Q And do you know that every single oral
  Page 96
[1]contraceptive manufacturer or labeler or marketer
[2]in the country has to report any adverse events to
[3]the FDA that it gets about its products?
[4]A They have to submit reports; I don't know
[5]that they have to submit everything they know.
[6]They submit reports every year, that's what I
[7]know.
[8]Q So some of the data that's available, at
[9]least to the FDA, is the reports of adverse events
[10]from every manufacturer of combination oral
[11]contraceptives in the country; correct?
[12]A Can you repeat that?
[13]Q Some of the data that's available to FDA
[14]about the risk of hepatic adenoma includes all of
[15]the adverse event reporting data, the post
[16]marketing adverse event reporting data that's
[17]submitted by every single drug company in America
[18]that markets an oral contraceptive; correct?
[19]A Every drug company that has a product has
[20]to submit reports to them.
[21]Q And I think you testified earlier that
[22]you don't know how frequently they have to do
[23]that; right?
[24]A Right.
[25]Q You're not an expert in FDA regulatory
  Page 97
[1]affairs; correct?
[2]A Right.
[3]Q So when you say that Teva used outdated
[4]data, specifically what are you talking about
[5]there?
[6]A Let me think. Well, I mean the data is
[7]like 20 to 30 years old that's used.
[8]Q Are you specifically talking about the
[9]case-control epidemiological data, specifically
[10]Rooks, which is the most frequently cited paper
[11]for the incidence rate, is that one of the things
[12]you're talking about?
[13]A That's one of them.
[14]Q And so I don't know if I asked this
[15]question or not, but as you sit here today, can
[16]you point to any other case-control studies that
[17]report a different incidence rate that would be
[18]more accurate, in your view?
[19]Let's start over. Is there anything
[20]inaccurate about the incidence rate that's
[21]reported in the Rooks paper?
[22]A Inaccurate where?
[23]Q The Rooks paper reports an incidence
[24]rate; correct?
[25]A Yes.
  Page 98
[1]Q Let's look at Rooks. And we'll mark this
[2]as Exhibit 9.
[3](Exhibit No. 9 was marked for purposes of
[4]identification.)
[5]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[6]Q And let's go to the very last page of the
[7]paper, 648. And I want to look at the first full
[8]paragraph on that page. And this is in the
[9]section of the -- and this is JAMA, the Journal of
[10]the American Medical Association, August of 1979;
[11]correct?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q And it says in the section called
[14]"Incidence," it says, "Applying the risk estimate
[15]for long-term, low-potency OC users to the
[16]age-specific baseline risks, we estimate that for
[17]long-term users of low-potency OCs, the annual
[18]incidence of HCA is 3.4 per 100,000."
[19]Did I read that correctly?
[20]A Yes.
[21]Q And do you believe that's an accurate
[22]statement?
[23]A That's what's in the papers, yes, it is.
[24]Q And can you cite to any more current or
[25]different incidence rate for annual incidence of
  Page 99
[1]hepatocellular adenoma for long-term users of
[2]low-potency oral contraceptives than this?
[3]A No. We have the series of papers that
[4]describe the adenomas and the oral contraceptive
[5]user, I mentioned earlier in the deposition, so
[6]there's about eight subsequent papers that talk
[7]about that subject.
[8]Q Right. And they almost all uniformly
[9]refer to this as the incidence rate, the one
[10]that's reported in Rooks, don't they?
[11]A This is the one that's quoted the most,
[12]yes.
[13]Q So again, as you sit here today, are you
[14]aware of any paper that reports what you believe
[15]to be a more accurate incidence rate of hepatic
[16]adenoma in long-term users of low-potency oral
[17]contraceptives than this one that's reported in
[18]1979 in the Rooks paper?
[19]A This is the one that we find, yes.
[20]Q I may have more on that in a bit, but
[21]that's all I have on it for now.
[22]Do you know, Doctor -- well, let me ask
[23]you this: Was the warning on the Seasonale and
[24]Seasonique labeling, in your opinion, was it
[25]inadequate at the time it was approved?
  Page 100
[1]A It looks like it was vague in terms of --
[2]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[3]THE WITNESS: -- explaining the risk of
[4]how the adenomas would increase with usage of
[5]oral contraceptives.
[6]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[7]Q So when you say, "Instead, while earlier
[8]versions of the labels stated that the risk
[9]increases after four years of use, the label may
[10]confuse physicians because it is unclear whether
[11]the risk increases to 3.3 per 100,000 users or
[12]whether the risk is actually greater."
[13]Did I read that correctly?
[14]A That's what it says there.
[15]Q So what you're saying is that a
[16]prescribing physician might be confused because
[17]that prescribing physician might not know if
[18]there's a -- let me ask it this way: Do you think
[19]that the label clearly informs prescribing
[20]physicians that the risk is at least 3.3 per
[21]100,000?
[22]A Yes, it does.
[23]Q And then you start into the section of
[24]your paper that discusses the "Literature on
[25]Hepatic Adenomas." And you say, "The risks of
  Page 101
[1]bleeding were minimally mentioned." But the label
[2]does say, "Rupture of hepatic adenoma may cause
[3]death through intra-abdominal bleeding"; correct?
[4]A Where are you getting that from?
[5]Q Well, let's see. You looked at the
[6]Seasonique 2009 you said, I think. Let's look at
[7]that. I don't want to make these exhibits. I
[8]may, depending on your answer, but I'm going to
[9]show you Seasonale, revision of January 2009, and
[10]I'll also show you Seasonique, the December 2008.
[11]I'm going to switch to the warnings
[12]section that we've been discussing. And this one
[13]from the Seasonale 2009, it says, "Benign hepatic
[14]adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive
[15]use. Although their occurrence is rare in the
[16]United States, indirect calculations have
[17]estimated the attributable risk to be in the range
[18]of 3.3 cases per 100,000 for users, a risk that
[19]increases after four or more years of use.
[20]Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death
[21]through intra-abdominal hemorrhage."
[22]Did I read that correctly?
[23]A Yes, you did.
[24]Q Confirm for me that the Seasonique 2008
[25]is identical to that. Can you just confirm that
  Page 102
[1]that is identical to what we just read?
[2]A It is identical.
[3]Q That's correct, isn't it, rupture of
[4]hepatic adenomas may cause death through
[5]intra-abdominal hemorrhage; correct?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q It's correct that in your view benign
[8]hepatic adenomas are associated with oral
[9]contraceptive use, although their occurrence is
[10]rare in the United States; correct?
[11]A Can you repeat that?
[12]Q Yes.
[13]Do you agree with this statement: Benign
[14]hepatic adenomas are associated with oral
[15]contraceptive use, although their occurrence is
[16]rare in the United States?
[17]A I don't agree with that statement. It's
[18]a very vague statement. I don't agree that it's a
[19]rare thing.
[20]Q Well, you said at your last deposition
[21]that it was rare.
[22]A Well --
[23]Q Have you changed your opinion on that?
[24]A I learned a lot more since the last
[25]deposition, Mr. Suffern. Okay?
  Page 103
[1]Q So now you have a --
[2]A It's not a rare event. I show you there
[3]were eight series, recent series that show that
[4]over 50 percent of the patients that have adenomas
[5]use oral contraceptives.
[6]Q So you've changed your opinion since your
[7]last deposition, then. You now do not believe --
[8]A I've changed many opinions.
[9]Q I'm sorry. Can I finish so we have a
[10]clear record.
[11]Now you no longer believe the occurrence
[12]of benign hepatic adenoma is rare?
[13]A I'd have to see what I said in my
[14]deposition. I don't think it's a rare event.
[15]That's my opinion.
[16]Q And you're basing that on more recent
[17]literature?
[18]A On extensive literature. When you
[19]deposed me I had -- I mean, this is not something
[20]that I had encyclopedic knowledge of the subject.
[21]Okay? So there's new information, and I think
[22]there's plenty of evidence that there's a lot of
[23]adenomas and a lot of usage of the drugs and the
[24]links of causality and the risk and the things
[25]that I mentioned.
  Page 104
[1]Q Well, do you now know today that the
[2]incidence rate of benign hepatic adenoma in the
[3]general public is higher than what you believed it
[4]was a year ago or less than a year ago when we
[5]took your deposition?
[6]A No, I'm not claiming that.
[7]Q I mean, is there any data that indicates
[8]that the incidence rate of benign hepatic adenoma
[9]in the general population is higher than what it
[10]was in November of 2018?
[11]A Well, you have to specifically talk about
[12]women with oral contraceptives, which is the
[13]subject of this case. I don't have like any new
[14]studies that show new incidence rates.
[15]Q But on the question of whether it's rare
[16]or not, we're not only talking about women who use
[17]oral contraceptives, right, we're talking about
[18]the incidence rate of hepatic adenoma; correct?
[19]That's my question.
[20]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[21]THE WITNESS: The incidence rates that
[22]are in the studies are on people that use oral
[23]contraceptives, Mr. Suffern, not in men, not in
[24]other things.
[25]BY MR. SUFFERN:
  Page 105
[1]Q Right. But in order for a prescribing
[2]physician to understand what the risk that his or
[3]her patient might have of getting a hepatic
[4]adenoma when they're trying to decide whether or
[5]not to prescribe oral contraceptives, that
[6]physician has to know what the incidence rate in
[7]the general population is, which includes users of
[8]oral contraceptives and nonusers; correct?
[9]A No. I think it depends. You know, if
[10]you're talking about a particular product or
[11]disease, you deal with the incidence rates of the
[12]disease that you're dealing with.
[13]Q Right. And my only question is: In
[14]order to understand what the incidence rate of
[15]benign hepatic adenomas is for users of oral
[16]contraceptives, one must also know what the
[17]background rate is; correct?
[18]A You could, but the male is shifting so
[19]that doesn't affect what the women are doing.
[20]Many more men cases are being diagnosed, but that
[21]doesn't change what's happening in the female
[22]epidemiology; it shifts the numbers, but it
[23]doesn't change the epidemiology of the particular
[24]populations.
[25]Q I'm sorry, I just don't understand. I
  Page 106
[1]guess my question really has nothing to do with
[2]this case in general. In general if you're going
[3]to report an incidence rate for people who are
[4]using a drug, don't you by logical necessity need
[5]to know what the background rate is?
[6]A Yes, you do. The Rooks study has that
[7]information. Rooks did a case-control study.
[8]Q Right. And my question that led us down
[9]this path is: Are you aware of any better or more
[10]current data about the incidence rate of hepatic
[11]adenoma in the general population than that which
[12]is reported in Rooks?
[13]A No, not in the general population. I'm
[14]not aware of that.
[15]Q Okay. And you'd agree that today -- I
[16]think you even mentioned this in your report. I'm
[17]sorry. I'll try to stop editorializing.
[18]You'd agree, Doctor, that in the last
[19]decade, because of advancements in imaging, a lot
[20]more hepatic adenomas are being discovered than
[21]were in the past; correct?
[22]A I agree with that. I think that's in my
[23]report. We have to be careful with comparing
[24]incidence rates and making assumptions.
[25]Q Right.
  Page 107
[1]Further down on page 7, you say, "The
[2]risks of bleeding from hepatic adenomas are also
[3]very well described in the literature. They
[4]should have been well described in the package
[5]inserts."
[6]You don't think that the statement that
[7]"Rupture of hepatic adenoma may cause death
[8]through intra-abdominal bleeding," you don't think
[9]that that adequately describes the risk of a
[10]hepatic adenoma?
[11]A The risk --
[12]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[13]Mischaracterizes his opinion. Let me impose an
[14]objection. It mischaracterizes his opinion.
[15]THE WITNESS: It doesn't quantify the
[16]risk. I mean, it's stated it can cause a
[17]problem, but it doesn't tell you much about how
[18]much it would be.
[19]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[20]Q And what data can you cite that does talk
[21]about how often hepatic adenomas rupture in women
[22]who are using oral contraceptives?
[23]A I would have to look and see if it's in
[24]the report, Mr. Suffern. There's plenty of
[25]literature on that. I don't know if I included
  Page 108
[1]it. I'll have to check.
[2]MR. SUFFERN: I'm sorry, I have to take
[3]another quick break.
[4]THE WITNESS: Sure, no problem.
[5](Recess taken from 10:33 a.m. to
[6]10:41 a.m.)
[7]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[8]Q Doctor, before we dive back into your
[9]report, my interest was piqued by one thing that I
[10]didn't ask you about. You mentioned the
[11]plaintiff's name -- I think it was you -- as
[12]Michelle Smith Rodriguez. Has she gotten married?
[13]Do you know?
[14]A Where did I mention that?
[15]Q It's on the second page. It says, "I am
[16]familiar with the standards of care for medical
[17]practices that currently relate to the issues of
[18]care and treatment of patients such" -- I guess
[19]you mean as -- "Michelle Smith Rodriguez."
[20]A On the second page?
[21]Q Right at the very top of the second page.
[22]Right before you talk about what you've reviewed.
[23]A I don't know where that came from. Maybe
[24]it's in the records somewhere.
[25]MR. SUFFERN: Has she gotten married,
  Page 109
[1]Jeff?
[2]MR. HABERMAN: No. I think it's a typo.
[3]Not that I'm aware of.
[4]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[5]Q Back to your report. Going to Roman
[6]numeral II on page 8, we've already read that
[7]opinion into the record. This is your causation
[8]opinion that you believe Michelle Smith's very
[9]large hepatic adenoma and innumerable other ones
[10]were a result of her longstanding use of oral
[11]contraceptives; correct?
[12]A That's what it says there.
[13]Q Is that your opinion, sir?
[14]A Yes, sir.
[15]Q And I just want to make sure I close the
[16]loop on this. Do you have an opinion one way or
[17]the other, as you sit here today, whether the
[18]innumerable other ones that you cite in that
[19]sentence were, in fact, hepatocellular adenomas
[20]versus some other lesion such as a focal nodular
[21]hyperplasia?
[22]A They were documented as adenomas in my
[23]documentation, and that's where I stand.
[24]Q You had earlier in your report cited a
[25]paper by an author named Reddy.
  Page 110
[1]A Rajender Reddy.
[2]Q And I think that was 1993. And I want to
[3]have a look at that one. And I'll mark this as
[4]Exhibit 8. I marked Rooks 9, so I'll mark this
[5]out of order as 8. And this is entitled "Approach
[6]to a Liver Mass," K. Reddy, et al., Seminars in
[7]Liver Disease, 1993.
[8](Exhibit No. 8 was marked for purposes of
[9]identification.)
[10]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[11]Q I just want to make sure I didn't mark my
[12]copy. No. Okay. There you go.
[13]We were talking a little bit earlier
[14]about adenomatosis. And one of the papers that
[15]you've relied upon in reaching your expert
[16]opinions in this case is this paper by Reddy;
[17]correct?
[18]A Correct.
[19]Q And on the first page of it, 423, there's
[20]a statement on the right-hand column down toward
[21]the bottom of the penultimate paragraph there.
[22]There's a statement, "In the 1970s, the estimated
[23]annual incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was 3
[24]to 4 per 100,000 for long-term users of oral
[25]contraceptives."
  Page 111
[1]And he cites to a paper there, number 5,
[2]and that's Rooks; correct?
[3]A Correct.
[4]Q Okay. And so this is 1993. Now, Reddy
[5]is still citing Rooks for the incidence rate;
[6]correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q And then at the very bottom of that page,
[9]it says, "A general perception now is that HCA" --
[10]That means hepatocellular adenoma;
[11]correct?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q -- "are not as commonly seen as in the
[14]1970s and 1980s, and this may be related to lower
[15]concentration of estrogens in oral
[16]contraceptives."
[17]Did I read that correctly?
[18]A You read that correctly.
[19]Q Do you agree with that statement?
[20]A You read what it says. It talks about a
[21]general perception. It doesn't say what the
[22]scientific evidence shows. This is a very
[23]strange, confusing sentence, because the
[24]perception may not mean anything.
[25]Q And so my question was: Do you agree
  Page 112
[1]with the statement, though?
[2]A I can't comment about the rates and the
[3]lower estrogen concentration, Mr. Suffern.
[4]Q Then moving over to the next page, it
[5]talks about some risk factors for the development
[6]of hepatocellular adenomas. I'm looking at the
[7]last sentence on the left-hand column. It says,
[8]"A similar condition, although with the absence of
[9]underlying glycogen storage disease, is liver
[10]adenomatosis, which is characterized by numerous
[11]hepatic cell adenomas (more than 10)." And then
[12]there's a citation to note 25.
[13]Then it continues, "This occurs among
[14]both men and women, is not related to the use of
[15]contraceptive steroids, and is associated with
[16]abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase and
[17]y-glutamoyl transpeptidase levels."
[18]Did I read that correctly?
[19]A You did, yes.
[20]Q And do you agree with that statement?
[21]A I agree with that statement. It appears
[22]that glycogen storage diseases are linked to
[23]adenomatosis.
[24]Q I thought it says in the absence of
[25]underlying glycogen storage disease --
  Page 113
[1]A Okay.
[2]Q -- a similar condition with the absence
[3]of glycogen storage disease is liver adenomatosis;
[4]correct?
[5]A Yes. Here they're talking about this
[6]condition occurring in the absence of glycogen
[7]storage disease and not related to the use of oral
[8]contraceptive steroids.
[9]Q It says it happens in both men and women;
[10]that's true, isn't it?
[11]A Yes.
[12]Q It also says it's not related to the use
[13]of contraceptive steroids; correct?
[14]A It says that.
[15]Q And you agree with that?
[16]A I mean, let me see what -- I would agree.
[17]I mean if Dr. Reddy and Dr. Schiff made that
[18]statement, I would agree with it.
[19]Q And then it also says -- again, talking
[20]about adenomatosis -- it's associated with these
[21]abnormal serum levels. And those are the same
[22]labs that you've already noted in your report were
[23]abnormally high for Michelle Smith; correct?
[24]A Some of them. They're talking about a
[25]little bit different test here.
  Page 114
[1]Q Well, the alkaline phosphatase is one,
[2]correct, the alk phos?
[3]A That's the only one that they mention
[4]here. Those are nonspecific elevations. They
[5]don't -- they're just mentioning that those tests
[6]were high in that particular condition.
[7]Q And then I think the last question I have
[8]about this Reddy paper is on page 425, the next
[9]page, the left-hand column. It says, "Earlier
[10]reports demonstrated a decrease in size and
[11]disappearance of adenomas following withdrawal of
[12]oral contraceptives. However, occasionally they
[13]have been noted to grow despite this continuation
[14]of oral contraceptives and, furthermore, adenomas
[15]have been observed with foci of malignancy and
[16]also to dedifferentiate into hepatocellular
[17]carcinoma."
[18]A That's what that says.
[19]Q Do you agree that sometimes they decrease
[20]in size after withdrawal from oral contraceptives,
[21]but sometimes they don't?
[22]A Yes, sir.
[23]Q That's all I have for that one.
[24]And then again, just on this topic of
[25]adenomatosis, I wanted to show you another paper.
  Page 115
[1]The first author is Barthelmes,
[2]B-a-r-t-h-e-l-m-e-s, and this is a review article
[3]from the journal HPB, 2005. Do you recognize that
[4]journal?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q Let me put an exhibit sticker on that
[7]one. It's Exhibit 10.
[8](Exhibit No. 10 was marked for purposes
[9]of identification.)
[10]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[11]Q And is this one of the papers upon which
[12]you rely on in reaching your opinions in this
[13]case?
[14]A I'm trying to find it in my list of
[15]references.
[16]Q Let's see. I thought that you actually
[17]called it out at one point, but let me see.
[18]A It's not listed.
[19]Q Perhaps it's not, but let me ask you
[20]about it. Just one second. I'm sorry.
[21]In any case, let me just ask: Do you see
[22]on the first page of this paper -- well, do you
[23]recognize this as a reputable journal in your
[24]field?
[25]A It is a reputable journal.
  Page 116
[1]Q Do you recognize this author's name at
[2]all?
[3]A Not at all. They're from England.
[4]Q So on the very first page of this, the
[5]second full paragraph, it says, "Liver cell
[6]adenoma secondary to estrogen/progestogen
[7]ingestion is usually solitary, but some people may
[8]develop several adenomas disseminated throughout
[9]the liver. This latter condition is known as
[10]liver cell adenomatosis, does not have the strong
[11]association with estrogen or anabolic steroid
[12]ingestion and affects males more readily."
[13]Did I ready that correctly?
[14]A You read that correctly.
[15]Q And do you agree with that?
[16]A Let me read it again. I mean, this is a
[17]general statement. Adenomatosis can occur from
[18]many different things, so -- it occurs in men, it
[19]occurs with anabolic steroids. I don't have much
[20]of an opinion about, you know, what that says.
[21]Q Well, you don't disagree with it; is that
[22]fair?
[23]A Yes. Because there's so many exceptions,
[24]it's such a general statement, so I don't
[25]disagree.
  Page 117
[1]Q And do you recognize the author Flejou,
[2]F-l-e-j-o-u? Do you recognize that author?
[3]A I'll have to look. It doesn't sound too
[4]familiar. I don't know.
[5]Q Let's see. If you'll look on your
[6]references --
[7]A Did you find the article?
[8]Q I did.
[9]A How do you spell it?
[10]Q F-l-e-j-o-u.
[11]A I don't think I have that.
[12](Exhibit No. 11 was marked for purposes
[13]of identification.)
[14]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[15]Q Hold on a second. This is from the
[16]journal of Gastroenterology 1985. Do you
[17]recognize Gastroenterology as a reliable journal?
[18]A Yes, sir.
[19]Q I've marked that as Exhibit 11. This is
[20]a case report entitled "Liver Adenomatosis: An
[21]Entity Distinct From Liver Adenoma? And it's by
[22]Flejou and others.
[23]If you look at the abstract under Section
[24]b, lower case b, it says, "Liver adenomatosis is
[25]unrelated whereas liver adenoma is closely related
  Page 118
[1]to oral contraceptive use."
[2]Did I read that correctly?
[3]A You read that correctly.
[4]Q And then further down it says, "Liver
[5]adenomatosis can be defined by the presence of
[6]numerous (arbitrarily greater than 10) hepatic
[7]cell adenomas."
[8]And then, it says, "The purpose of this
[9]report is (a) to describe the features of this
[10]uncommon liver disease; and (b) to suggest that
[11]liver adenomatosis may be an entity distinct from
[12]liver adenoma."
[13]Did I read that correctly?
[14]A Yes, you did.
[15]Q And I apologize if I've already asked you
[16]this, but do you believe that liver adenomatosis
[17]is an entity that is distinct from liver adenoma?
[18]A I think it's variant. I mean, it doesn't
[19]mean that patients with adenomas cannot get
[20]adenomatosis. I don't think it says that here in
[21]this paper, that they're completely exclusive.
[22]Q But look over here at page No. 1136 under
[23]the "Discussion" section where it says, "From the
[24]study of our five cases and the review of eight
[25]previously published cases, the features of liver
  Page 119
[1]adenomatosis can be outlined. Men and women seem
[2]to be equally affected: among the 13 patients
[3]there were five men and eight women. There is no
[4]evident relationship between liver adenomatosis
[5]and oral contraceptives: among the eight women
[6]with liver adenomatosis, only three used oral
[7]contraceptives."
[8]Did I read that correctly?
[9]A You read that correctly. And that's a
[10]big number. That's about 40 percent of the
[11]patients had used oral contraceptives.
[12]Q Right. But at least as to this author,
[13]that leads to the conclusion that there is, quote,
[14]"no evident relationship between liver
[15]adenomatosis and oral contraceptives"; isn't that
[16]correct?
[17]A That's what they're saying.
[18]Q And do you disagree with that?
[19]A Well, I mean, it doesn't go with the
[20]numbers that they found, three out of eight were
[21]using oral contraceptives, so that was their
[22]opinion. Their conclusion is not supported by
[23]their data.
[24]You know, I'm not going to agree to their
[25]conclusion when three out of eight had it. If
  Page 120
[1]none of them had it, then we can say maybe there's
[2]something there.
[3]Q Well, and these are case reports, too.
[4]There's no controls, there are no denominators,
[5]right, these are just case reports; right?
[6]MR. HABERMAN: Everybody calm down.
[7]THE WITNESS: The denominator here is
[8]that eight of the patients -- the denominator
[9]is eight adenomatosis patients three use oral
[10]contraceptives. That's what they found.
[11]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[12]Q But there are no controls; correct?
[13]A Controls, there are a series of 20
[14]patients that have adenomas in the other side of
[15]the study.
[16]Q All right. And those didn't use oral
[17]contraceptives at all, did they?
[18]A We'll have to check. Do you know that
[19]for sure?
[20]Q It's a question. I'm sorry.
[21]A Okay. Let's look at the answer. 78
[22]percent of adenoma patients took oral
[23]contraceptives, Mr. Suffern.
[24]Q Of the controls?
[25]A There were 18 women in the control group,
  Page 121
[1]14, or 78 percent, took oral contraceptives.
[2]Q And how many of those got adenomas?
[3]A These were all adenoma patients.
[4]Q Thank you.
[5]A There were 20 adenoma patients and there
[6]were five adenomatosis patients.
[7]Q I see. I guess I'm wondering: Is there
[8]any reason why you didn't discuss adenomatosis at
[9]all in your report?
[10]A No particular reason. I don't think that
[11]she has glycogen storage disease, she doesn't have
[12]a systematic disease, you know, so I did not
[13]include it.
[14]Q And is it your understanding that
[15]adenomatosis is related to glycogen storage
[16]disease?
[17]A We just found out in one paper there was
[18]no link. That's only one paper that we reviewed
[19]today, so I'm not sure that I'm going to 100
[20]percent conclude with that.
[21]Q One paper that you do cite is Klatskin,
[22]K-l-a-t-s-k-i-n.
[23]A Yes, sir.
[24]Q Let's have a look at that one. And we'll
[25]mark this as Exhibit 12.
  Page 122
[1](Exhibit No. 12 was marked for purposes
[2]of identification.)
[3]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[4]Q And you cite this paper on page 9 of your
[5]report where it says, "The increased in incidence
[6]of hepatic adenomas associated with the onset of
[7]OCs." You say, "Emphasized in four reports:
[8]Kerlin, Klatskin, Christopherson, and Mays";
[9]correct?
[10]A Yes.
[11]Q And I think you have a typo there. You
[12]say "Klatskin 2007," but did you really mean 1977?
[13]Is it this paper marked as Exhibit 12 that you're
[14]referring to?
[15]A Let me look at the reference. Here it
[16]is, 1977.
[17]Q So that's just a typo, I'm not missing
[18]some other more recent paper; correct?
[19]A It looks like it's the one you have here
[20]that I put in the reference section.
[21]Q And in the Klatskin case he reports on
[22]138 cases of hepatic adenoma in people who are not
[23]using oral contraceptives; correct?
[24]A I'll have to check on that. Do you want
[25]me to find it?
  Page 123
[1]Q I'm trying to find it for you. Look at
[2]the first page. He's talking about the cases that
[3]he's discussing. "As shown in Table 1, the number
[4]of cases reported annually since 1973 has risen
[5]dramatically, so by August 1976 there were at
[6]least 105." Then he says there were an additional
[7]118 he found not cited in the literature, bringing
[8]the total to 223; correct?
[9]A Correct.
[10]Q Those are cases of hepatic adenoma;
[11]right?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q But then in Table 1 where he reports on
[14]hepatic tumors in women -- sorry. I just can't
[15]find it. I'm sorry.
[16]Move over here to page S13. S13 on the
[17]right-hand column he says, about a quarter of the
[18]way down, "For purposes of comparison with oral
[19]contraceptive-associated tumors, I have culled
[20]from the literature 138 cases of hepatic cell
[21]adenoma" -- and then he cites all of the cases --
[22]"found in patients with no history of exposure to
[23]oral contraceptives."
[24]After the long string cite of case
[25]reports, he says, "I have culled from the
  Page 124
[1]literature 138 cases of hepatic cell adenoma found
[2]in patients with no history of exposure to oral
[3]contraceptives."
[4]A Where does it say the second part of your
[5]sentence?
[6]Q At the very bottom, after the long string
[7]cite where he's citing all the cases that he
[8]pulled. Do you see that?
[9]A Yeah, but there's 234 cases of focal
[10]nodular hyperplasia here in the middle ingrained
[11]in that.
[12]Q Yeah, but my only question was --
[13]A You have to be careful how you're reading
[14]this. There's two series of diseases here in this
[15]column. Okay. 138 cases --
[16]Q In patients with no history of exposure.
[17]A The sentence ends after Goldstein, 1974,
[18]it stops there. "...and 234 cases of FNH found in
[19]patients with no history of oral contraceptives."
[20]Okay. So I don't know if he's saying
[21]that these two series of diseased patients are not
[22]related or is it the FNH or is it the adenomas or
[23]both?
[24]Q I'm just following you, Doctor.
[25]A Okay. Well --
  Page 125
[1]Q The way I read this, it says, "For
[2]purposes of comparison with oral
[3]contraceptive-associated tumors I have culled from
[4]the literature 138 cases of hepatic cell
[5]adenoma" -- and then he starts a long string of
[6]citations to those cases.
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q And then the sentence finishes "found in
[9]patients with no history of exposure to oral
[10]contraceptives"; correct?
[11]A Correct. So the adenomas that he quotes
[12]here and the FNHs had no history of oral
[13]contraceptive use, that is correct.
[14]Q Okay. And so one of the papers that you
[15]rely on for your opinions about the increased
[16]incidence of hepatic adenomas is this 1977 paper,
[17]which includes a statement that 138 cases had no
[18]exposure to oral contraceptives; correct?
[19]A Just like any other paper would include.
[20]Q Okay. My only question is: Is that
[21]correct?
[22]A It is correct. And there's always going
[23]to be patients that don't have oral contraceptive
[24]use.
[25]Q Right.
  Page 126
[1]A I think you should allow that.
[2]Q And that means that there are other
[3]things that have to be considered in connection
[4]with causality and hepatic adenoma besides oral
[5]contraceptives; correct?
[6]A Yes, sir.
[7]Q And Michelle Smith has at least three of
[8]those things; correct?
[9]A Can you specify?
[10]Q She's obese, she has fatty liver, and she
[11]has NASH.
[12]A Okay. So I'll go with at least two
[13]recognized risk factors.
[14]Q Other than oral contraceptives?
[15]A Yes.
[16]Q Which one won't you recognize in that
[17]lineup?
[18]A The NASH.
[19]Q The NASH.
[20]You don't think that's a risk factor?
[21]A NASH is not a direct link. I haven't
[22]found anything. If you want to talk about that,
[23]we have just a handful of case reports, so there's
[24]not a big link in the NASH pathway.
[25]Q And another paper you cite here for the
  Page 127
[1]increased incidence is Mays, the 1984 paper. And
[2]let's have a look at that.
[3]A True.
[4]Q This we'll mark as Exhibit 13.
[5](Exhibit No. 13 was marked for purposes
[6]of identification.)
[7]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[8]Q Do you see where in your report under
[9]Section B there on page 9 you say, "Emphasized in
[10]four reports: Kerlin, Klatskin, Christopherson,
[11]and Mays"? So this is Mays, isn't it?
[12]A That's Mays.
[13]Q 1984.
[14]A This is one of four papers that talk
[15]about the increased incidence with oral
[16]contraceptives. That's why they're listed there.
[17]Q Okay. And up at the top of page 152,
[18]this paper that you cite in support of your
[19]causation opinion says the following: "There is
[20]no conclusive evidence that there is a
[21]cause-and-effect relationship between primary
[22]tumors of the liver and oral contraceptives";
[23]correct?
[24]A It says that, and then there's another
[25]sentence after that.
  Page 128
[1]Q Then it says, "The association may be
[2]purely fortuitous, but a history of prolonged sex
[3]steroid administration, usually OCs, was present
[4]in a majority of the cases studied. The type of
[5]estrogen used most frequently was Mestranol,"
[6]M-e-s-t-r-a-n-o-l, "which in the early years of
[7]oral contraceptives usage was the most common
[8]component of the medication."
[9]Did I read that correctly?
[10]A Yes, you did.
[11]Q And Michelle Smith was not using an oral
[12]contraceptive that contained Mestranol, was she?
[13]A Not that I know of.
[14]Q And do you agree that there's no
[15]conclusive evidence that there's a
[16]cause-and-effect relationship between primary
[17]tumors of liver and oral contraceptives?
[18]A This is their conclusion --
[19]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[20]THE WITNESS: -- one of many, many
[21]articles, so I don't agree with that. This is
[22]what they found, this is what they stated.
[23]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[24]Q And you disagree with that; is that fair?
[25]A I think that's fair, based on a lot of
  Page 129
[1]the other evidence that we have.
[2]Q Okay. And back on page 150 here of this
[3]paper there's a discussion of estrogen receptors.
[4]Do you see that?
[5]A What page?
[6]Q Page 150.
[7]A Yes, sir.
[8]Q And it says, "Estrogen and progesterone
[9]receptor studies were done on a small number of
[10]tumors using well documented techniques."
[11]Do you see that?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q It says, "Receptor data from the few
[14]cases that had tissue available for analysis
[15]suggests an indirect relationship with
[16]contraceptive steroids."
[17]Did I read that correctly?
[18]A That's at the bottom here?
[19]Q Estrogen receptors, right.
[20]A Okay. How does the sentence begin?
[21]Q It says, "Receptor data from the few
[22]cases that had tissue available for analysis
[23]suggest an indirect relationship with oral
[24]contraceptive steroids"; correct?
[25]A That's correct, what you read.
  Page 130
[1]Q I asked you a little earlier about
[2]whether you could test Michelle Smith's tumor for
[3]estrogen receptor status, and I think you said
[4]that you didn't know; correct?
[5]A I don't know if it can still be done.
[6]Q And in any case you said you didn't know
[7]if it would affect your opinions one way or
[8]another even if it had been done; right?
[9]A Yes.
[10]Q And over on page 153 here, in this paper
[11]that you cite in support of your opinions,
[12]Dr. Mays says, in the first full paragraph on 153,
[13]"Of the 378 primary hepatic tumors, 187 (49.5
[14]percent) were present in women who were using or
[15]who had used oral contraceptives; 80 (21.7
[16]percent) in women who had never used oral
[17]contraceptives; and 111 (29.4 percent) in women
[18]whose history of use of oral contraceptives was
[19]not available."
[20]Did I read that correctly?
[21]A You did read it correctly.
[22]Q So again, even in this paper that you
[23]claim to support your opinion finds 20 percent of
[24]the tumors that they looked at were in people who
[25]never used oral contraceptives; correct?
  Page 131
[1]A And it shows that in 50 percent they used
[2]it and 20 percent it wasn't known, so it is
[3]consistent with the data that I found. And it
[4]seems that it is highly prevalent. There's always
[5]going to be a number of patients that are not on
[6]oral contraceptives and in this case it was
[7]20 percent.
[8]Q Do you know at the time the drug was
[9]approved, at the time Seasonale and Seasonique
[10]were approved, do you know which, if any, of these
[11]papers the Food and Drug Administration had
[12]available to them?
[13]A No, sir.
[14]Q And does that matter to your opinions at
[15]all about labeling in this case?
[16]A It would matter if they didn't know
[17]nothing versus if they knew something; it would
[18]matter a lot, I think.
[19]Q And you just don't know what they had
[20]available to them?
[21]A No, I don't know.
[22]Q And in any case, you're not an expert on
[23]FDA regulatory affairs in any case; right?
[24]A Yes, sir.
[25]Q That's correct?
  Page 132
[1]A That's correct.
[2]Q We saw one paper earlier, and I can't
[3]remember which one it was, but it said something
[4]like the risk of hepatic adenoma with oral
[5]contraceptives has been decreasing over the decade
[6]since lower-potency oral contraceptives were
[7]available. Do you recall us looking at a
[8]statement like that?
[9]A I may have seen that. I've run across
[10]that in the literature. That's a statement that
[11]is not too surprising. I'm not going to say
[12]anything else about that.
[13]Q It's been identified in, I've counted
[14]one, two, three, four, five, six papers that you
[15]cited in your report, a similar statement. And
[16]does that -- and I can identify them for you,
[17]Kapp, Dourakis, Van Aalten, Heinemann, Vana,
[18]and --
[19]A What was the statement?
[20]Q Just a general statement that the risk of
[21]hepatic adenoma from oral contraceptives has
[22]decreased in over the decades since lower-potency
[23]estrogen formulations have been on the market.
[24]And my question is: First of all, do you
[25]recall seeing such references in your review?
  Page 133
[1]A I recall seeing some references, yes.
[2]Q And do you agree with that?
[3]A I don't know that they have -- I don't
[4]know if these are general statements or they're
[5]supported by data in those articles. I'm going to
[6]leave it at that, because I don't think the
[7]articles pertain to dosing and incidence and
[8]number of cases. We haven't seen one of those.
[9]Q And let's just look at one, Heinemann,
[10]Exhibit 14.
[11](Exhibit No. 14 was marked for purposes
[12]of identification.)
[13]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[14]Q Did I give you two copies of that,
[15]Doctor?
[16]A Just one.
[17]Q Okay. And this is from 1998 from The
[18]European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive
[19]Health Care; correct?
[20]A Correct.
[21]Q Do you view that as a reputable journal?
[22]A I cannot comment on it. It's a European
[23]OB/GYN journal.
[24]Q In the conclusion section of the abstract
[25]it says, "There is little evidence for an
  Page 134
[1]increased risk of hepatocellular adenoma in women
[2]using modern oral contraceptives. If there is a
[3]risk not detected by the limited study size,
[4]hepatocellular adenoma is an extremely rare, and
[5]focal nodular hyperplasia a rare adverse effect
[6]potentially associated with long-term oral
[7]contraceptive use and likely to be without public
[8]health importance."
[9]Did I read that correctly?
[10]A You read that correctly.
[11]Q And do you agree with that statement?
[12]A Well, this is one of the few articles
[13]that talks about not having an increased risk. We
[14]have to look at the results of the study here.
[15]That's what they claim.
[16]Q So do you not have an opinion about
[17]whether that's an accurate conclusion or an
[18]inaccurate conclusion?
[19]A Give me a second so I can review this.
[20]"In 51 of the patients that they analyzed with
[21]adenomas 48 percent of them used oral
[22]contraceptives," page 195.
[23]Q Right. Can I direct you to Table 3 on
[24]page 197, which is described as "Impact of Time
[25]Variables on Odd Ratios and 95 Percent Confidence
  Page 135
[1]Intervals of Benign Liver Tumors in Women Exposed
[2]to Oral Contraceptives."
[3]And do you see that there are two
[4]columns, one for hepatocellular adenoma and one
[5]for focal nodular hyperplasia?
[6]A Yes.
[7]Q And under the hepatocellular adenoma
[8]column for women who had used oral contraceptives
[9]for 1 to 9 years the odds ratio was 0.96; correct?
[10]A Yes. And for the ones that used it 10 or
[11]more it was higher at 1.78.
[12]Q 1.78; correct?
[13]A Yes.
[14]Q And that led this author to conclude that
[15]there is little evidence for an increased risk of
[16]hepatocellular adenoma in women using modern oral
[17]contraceptives; correct?
[18]A That's what you just read in the
[19]conclusion. I would have to read this whole
[20]article and interpret it for you if you want me to
[21]render an opinion about what this data shows.
[22]This table doesn't pertain to any dosing; it just
[23]pertains to the overall population.
[24]Q It talks about years of use.
[25]A Yes, but not the dosing of modern oral
  Page 136
[1]contraceptives; right? It doesn't talk about the
[2]strengths of the medications, it just time
[3]periods.
[4]Q Right. In fact, isn't that one of the
[5]propositions of this study, is that with the
[6]modern formulations with lower estrogen they
[7]didn't even find any increased risk regardless of
[8]the duration of use? Isn't that what this paper
[9]finds?
[10]A This paper is something about that. And
[11]this table that we just looked at doesn't pertain
[12]much to dosing, so I would have to look at this
[13]more carefully to make any conclusions.
[14]Q If you look at page 199, the conclusion,
[15]it says, "In conclusion, we did not obtain
[16]sufficient evidence for a clinically relevant
[17]increased risk of hepatocellular adenoma and focal
[18]nodular hyperplasia associated with use of modern
[19]low-dose oral contraceptives. If there is a risk
[20]not detected by the limited study size,
[21]hepatocellular adenoma is an extremely rare and
[22]focal nodular hyperplasia is a rare adverse effect
[23]of modern oral contraceptives and both are likely
[24]to be without public health importance."
[25]Did I read that correctly?
  Page 137
[1]A Yes, you did.
[2]Q And as you sit here today, can you tell
[3]us one way or another whether you agree with that
[4]statement?
[5]A This is the only article that we found
[6]that talks about that, which is in a European
[7]journal. The other ones that we talk about don't
[8]have the same opinions. This is the one that
[9]talks about that.
[10]MR. SUFFERN: I need to go off the record
[11]one more time.
[12](Recess taken from 11:29 a.m. to
[13]11:32 a.m.)
[14]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[15]Q So, Doctor, you agree then there are at
[16]least some papers that even today question whether
[17]modern low-dose formulations even cause hepatic
[18]adenoma, there's some papers that question that;
[19]correct?
[20]A There is one paper that you showed me,
[21]the Heinemann paper, which I've seen before that
[22]concludes that.
[23]Q And then there are other papers that
[24]you've already acknowledged that at least suggest
[25]the incidence of hepatic adenoma has decreased as
  Page 138
[1]lower dose formulations have come to market;
[2]correct?
[3]A I don't know that that's a general
[4]conclusion.
[5]Q Okay. Well, then we're --
[6]A There's a mixture of opinions.
[7]Q We're just going to have to look at them,
[8]then.
[9]A Sure.
[10]Q Let's look at -- and I believe these are
[11]all papers that you cited. Let's look at --
[12]A My report, and the reason why it's in
[13]sections like that, is because all those papers
[14]conclude what's in the report. Okay? So I'm
[15]going with what my report says. You're going to
[16]find some things that say something different.
[17]The reports that I mention here conclude what's in
[18]the report, Mr. Suffern. Okay?
[19]So if you're going to mention three or
[20]four papers, there's other ones here that I've
[21]already listed that talks about risk, causality,
[22]incidence, and all those other things.
[23]Q Right. But I'm just focusing right now
[24]on this concept that modern lower dose
[25]formulations have led to a decrease in the risk.
  Page 139
[1]Okay? That's all I'm talking about now. And I
[2]just want to know if you -- I think you've already
[3]told me you recall seeing that in some of the
[4]papers.
[5]A I recognize those statements. I think if
[6]they're going to make those conclusions, we would
[7]have to see that they really have the numbers to
[8]back that up, do they have incidence numbers,
[9]which I haven't seen, we've seen some of the
[10]tables, so you would have to look at that further.
[11]Q Here's what I'm trying to get at. You've
[12]already admitted that there are many subjects in
[13]these papers who had hepatic adenoma that did not
[14]take oral contraceptives. That's beyond dispute;
[15]correct?
[16]A Did not take them?
[17]Q Yes.
[18]A Yeah, and there's many more that took
[19]them also.
[20]Q Okay. Fine. I'm asking my questions
[21]now. I completely agree there were both of those
[22]things, but my question is focused on the women
[23]who got -- the people who got hepatic adenomas who
[24]didn't take oral contraceptives. You agree with
[25]me that there are many such people; correct?
  Page 140
[1]A Thousands, and probably hundreds of
[2]thousands.
[3]Q Okay. And then we're looking at data --
[4]we looked at one study that actually gives us
[5]numerical estimates of the odds ratio for modern
[6]formulations, the one we just looked at,
[7]Heinemann. We haven't looked at, but we can if
[8]you'd like, at papers that have at least said the
[9]incidence is decreasing with modern formulations.
[10]All I want to know is, in light of all
[11]that evidence, what is it that leads you -- what
[12]methodology did you employ to conclude that
[13]Michelle Smith falls into this group whose hepatic
[14]adenoma was caused by oral contraceptives, as
[15]opposed to this other group of people whose
[16]hepatic adenomas or adenomatosis were not caused
[17]by oral contraceptives? What methodology did you
[18]employ? What testing or analysis have you done or
[19]what studies do you rely upon in determining that?
[20]A All the studies that we have here in my
[21]report are pertinent to the conclusions. Most of
[22]the risk factors that lead to adenomas contain
[23]oral contraceptive use that I provided you today.
[24]So that's my methodology.
[25]The bulk of the evidence is indisputable.
  Page 141
[1]There are people that don't have oral
[2]contraceptive use that develop adenomas. I agree
[3]with that, too.
[4]Q Do you agree that it's an uncommon
[5]finding to find NASH in a patient with hepatic
[6]adenoma?
[7]A Yes, it's uncommon. It's in the
[8]background of a few cases. It's very uncommon.
[9]There's a handful of case reports in the U.S.
[10]literature. There is a series of patients that
[11]had 60 percent NASH in the background that I may
[12]have mentioned in my report, and most of those
[13]patients used oral contraceptives, but there's
[14]about three or four case reports, three
[15]established ones. There's a handful of them, and
[16]I mentioned those. And my thorough evaluation of
[17]NASH subsequently still confirmed that.
[18]Q On page 10 when you're talking about her
[19]fatty liver with inflammation, you mention that --
[20]I'm sorry, on the next page where you talk about
[21]association with fatty liver you say, "Steatosis
[22]and steatohepatitis are risk factors for
[23]inflammatory adenomas"; correct?
[24]A Yes, the inflammatory adenomas are people
[25]that have fatty livers more commonly. They are
  Page 142
[1]highly linked to obesity.
[2]Q And hers was not inflammatory; is that
[3]right?
[4]A It doesn't say in the path report,
[5]Mr. Suffern.
[6]Q I didn't --
[7]A It doesn't say it was an inflammatory
[8]adenoma in the path report. It doesn't classify
[9]it. It's beta-catenin negative. It doesn't have
[10]mutation. It doesn't have the HNF 1 alpha
[11]mutation. It's somewhat unclassified to some
[12]degree.
[13]Q What role, if any, does the fact that its
[14]inflammatory status is not identified in the
[15]pathology, what role does that play, if any, in
[16]your opinions in this case?
[17]A Not much. Not all of them are
[18]inflammatories, so....
[19]Q Are you assuming that hers was not
[20]inflammatory, or do you just not know?
[21]A It's not known based on the tests that
[22]were done, Mr. Suffern.
[23]Q Okay. The type of hepatic adenoma that's
[24]most often associated with oral contraceptives is
[25]also inflammatory, isn't it?
  Page 143
[1]A It is.
[2]Q Do you agree today, as you sit here
[3]today, that hepatic adenomas are more prevalent in
[4]people who are obese?
[5]A Yeah, they are more prevalent, and most
[6]of those patients use oral contraceptives. That's
[7]what the literature shows. There's a high
[8]prevalence of oral contraceptives in that group of
[9]people.
[10]Q Let me ask you about your opinions about
[11]complications of pregnancy. So her ability to
[12]become pregnant and have children was affected
[13]from the time period between 2013 to 2015. That's
[14]your opinion; correct?
[15]A What page are you on?
[16]Q It's Roman numeral IV, page 13.
[17]A Yes.
[18]Q "The complications she sustained due to
[19]the use of oral contraceptives affected her and
[20]delayed her ability to become pregnant and have
[21]children for the time period between 2013 and
[22]2015"; correct?
[23]A That's what that says. That would be
[24]fair. It's a period of recovery. I mean, she's
[25]had -- I mean, I don't know subsequent to that
  Page 144
[1]whether she was able to do it or not.
[2]Q Your professional opinion in this case is
[3]that she can get pregnant if she wants to;
[4]correct?
[5]A She falls into this gray zone, because
[6]the guidelines say that you shouldn't do it if you
[7]have a complicated adenoma during pregnancy, which
[8]she didn't have. She had a complication without
[9]being pregnant and she doesn't have a huge adenoma
[10]now that we know of. With the major complications
[11]that she had and the adenomas that were there she
[12]would not have been advised to become pregnant at
[13]that point. I'm not sure subsequently, if years
[14]go by and she's fine. I've had patients that have
[15]adenomas that have become pregnant.
[16]Q I'm trying to find out what your
[17]professional expert opinion is right now. And
[18]right now pregnancy is not contraindicated in
[19]Michelle Smith; correct?
[20]A Right now for her in 2019?
[21]Q Yes.
[22]A I don't know how she's doing right now.
[23]I can't comment about that. I don't know if she
[24]has 10 adenomas or one, or what, or how she is
[25]physically like she describes in the deposition.
  Page 145
[1]I'm not going to comment on her physical
[2]well-being.
[3]Q So you have no opinion right now that she
[4]can't become pregnant?
[5]A Right. I'm not sure how old she is right
[6]now.
[7]Q So your opinion on the effect of this
[8]problem with her pregnancy is limited to this:
[9]Between 2013 and 2015 she could not become
[10]pregnant; correct?
[11]A That's what that says, Mr. Suffern. I'm
[12]not going to extend it to any more time periods.
[13]Q Okay. And it's also -- you also say
[14]that, "The presence of hepatic adenomas is not a
[15]contraindication to pregnancy"; correct?
[16]A If she had a small one, she would
[17]probably be allowed to. She would not be in
[18]general, you know, unless there's a large one
[19]according to the guidelines of pregnancy that we
[20]may have included before, it would not be -- in
[21]general she should not be advised not to have it.
[22]The GYN people, or whoever is taking care of her,
[23]would have to follow the guidelines for
[24]recommendations.
[25]Q Would you defer to that area of expertise
  Page 146
[1]as far as her current ability to become pregnant,
[2]the OB/GYNs, in light of her current status? Is
[3]that their expertise?
[4]A Michelle Smith in general or any other
[5]patient?
[6]Q I'm talking about Michelle specifically.
[7]A I guess if we had a big concern from the
[8]standpoint she had an adenoma that was big, we
[9]would render an opinion and hopefully communicate
[10]with those doctors. That's what we do now with
[11]other patients.
[12]Q Here's my point. Based on everything you
[13]know today, if we were sitting in the courtroom
[14]trying this case today, you could not get on the
[15]witness stand and say Michelle Smith should not
[16]get pregnant; is that correct?
[17]A That's correct.
[18]Q Okay. Thank you.
[19]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[20]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[21]Q In fact, if I asked you, based on
[22]everything you know, pregnancy is not
[23]contraindicated for her, you would say yes;
[24]correct?
[25]A I would not be able to answer that
  Page 147
[1]question, Mr. Suffern, because I don't know. I
[2]cannot say that there's not a contraindication.
[3]Q Okay. You say in here, "Ms. Smith may
[4]reasonably fear getting pregnant given her past
[5]medical history."
[6]Is that an expert opinion, or is that
[7]Dr. Alsina just kind of saying that sounds
[8]reasonable?
[9]MR. HABERMAN: Objection. Objection.
[10]What kind of question was that?
[11]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[12]Q Sir, are you qualified by your education,
[13]training, and experience to comment on the
[14]reasonableness of Michelle Smith's fear regarding
[15]pregnancy?
[16]A Well, I mean, when we have patients in
[17]front of us, whether it's Michelle Smith or
[18]somebody else, we would be able to assess their
[19]fears and, you know, willingness to be pregnant,
[20]so we participate in that decision, but this is a
[21]subjective interpretation.
[22]Q Have you done that in this case? Have
[23]you, in fact, interpreted Michelle Smith's fear of
[24]getting pregnant?
[25]A Well, only if it's documented in any of
  Page 148
[1]her notes. We would have to go back and see if
[2]there's anything about pregnancy from a standpoint
[3]of --
[4]Q I believe I asked you in your last
[5]deposition if you even discussed pregnancy with
[6]her and you said no. Is that still the case?
[7]A If you say so. I mean, I don't know if
[8]that's true.
[9]Q Let's see what you said exactly.
[10]A In her deposition she mentions that I
[11]said something about pregnancy. I'm not sure if
[12]it's in my deposition, Mr. Suffern.
[13]Q I know that she said in her deposition
[14]that you told her she could never become pregnant.
[15]A Right.
[16]Q And when I asked you about that in your
[17]deposition -- well, let's see what you said.
[18]Let me just ask you, Doctor, because I'm
[19]having a hard time locating this, do you recall
[20]having any discussions with Michelle Smith about
[21]whether she could become pregnant?
[22]A I don't recall it today. We would have
[23]to check to see if there was anything documented
[24]about that.
[25]Q If there was nothing documented in your
  Page 149
[1]medical records, would it be fair to say you
[2]didn't have that discussion with her?
[3]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[4]THE WITNESS: Not necessarily. Since I
[5]don't remember, I'm not going to make anything
[6]up.
[7]MR. SUFFERN: Let's go off the record.
[8](Discussion off the record.)
[9]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[10]Q Back on the record.
[11]Okay. Doctor, with the help of the court
[12]reporter, we've actually found the question I
[13]asked you at your last deposition about this. It
[14]was on page 70, line 23, at the very bottom.
[15]"Did you ever tell Michelle Smith that
[16]she could never get pregnant?
[17]"Answer: I have no recollection of
[18]that."
[19]That's your same answer today, you don't
[20]know, you don't recall; correct?
[21]A Correct.
[22]Q If you had discussed it with her, you
[23]would have told her basically what you say in your
[24]report here, right, that contraindication is not
[25]necessarily contraindicated; correct?
  Page 150
[1]A No. The contraindications would pertain
[2]to an adenoma during pregnancy, which she didn't
[3]have, but she had a major complication from the
[4]adenoma. At that point back then we probably
[5]would have taken a cautious approach. This is
[6]speculative, Mr. Suffern. I don't think we would
[7]just tell her to become pregnant.
[8]Q Of course not. I'm just trying to
[9]understand if you're going to get on the witness
[10]stand in this case and say Michelle Smith can't
[11]become pregnant because of her hepatic adenoma.
[12]Are you going to do that?
[13]A As you of today?
[14]Q Yeah.
[15]A I already answered that question. I
[16]wouldn't be able to say that fairly.
[17]Q I'm getting close. I want to review my
[18]notes here.
[19]You've published literature -- I've
[20]looked at your CV -- you've been included as an
[21]author on scores of publications; correct?
[22]A Yes, sir.
[23]Q And not a single one of those addressed
[24]the relationship between hepatic adenomas and oral
[25]contraceptives; correct?
  Page 151
[1]A Correct.
[2]Q And you've never been involved in any
[3]clinical trials that had evidence pertinent to
[4]that question; correct?
[5]A No, sir.
[6]Q That is correct?
[7]A Yes.
[8]Q The only information you have about what,
[9]if anything, Teva knew about hepatic adenomas and
[10]oral contraceptives comes from the deposition of
[11]Lisa Carle; correct?
[12]A Yes.
[13]Q And you don't know what the FDA had
[14]available to it when it issued class labeling
[15]guidelines -- let me back up.
[16]Do you know that the FDA has issued class
[17]labeling guidelines for oral contraceptives?
[18]A Yes, they are the ones we examined here.
[19]Q And you knew that at the time you were
[20]writing your report?
[21]A That the FDA had -- what was the
[22]question?
[23]Q The FDA issued class labeling guidelines
[24]for oral contraceptives.
[25]A No. I think I found that out later that
  Page 152
[1]it was a class label, not at the beginning of
[2]the --
[3]Q You found that out only after reading
[4]Lisa Carle's deposition?
[5]A Yes.
[6]Q Do you know what standard the FDA uses to
[7]assess supplemental applications that propose to
[8]add or strengthen a warning in a drug label?
[9]A Not specifically, no.
[10]Q And you're not intending to give expert
[11]opinions on that topic; correct?
[12]A Correct.
[13]Q Do you believe that any of the risk
[14]factors that Michelle Smith had for the
[15]development of hepatic adenoma, other than oral
[16]contraceptives, contributed in any way to the
[17]formation of her hepatic adenomas in this case?
[18]A They could have contributed. Usually
[19]those risk factors that she had are linked to
[20]adenomas in patients that use oral contraceptives,
[21]but they could have contributed. I don't know how
[22]many thin people develop adenomas, but the risk
[23]factors -- she has two independent risk factors,
[24]obesity and oral contraceptives. And the
[25]independent risk factors are highly linked -- each
  Page 153
[1]of them being linked to the condition.
[2]Q And you believe that each of those risk
[3]factors could have contributed to the development
[4]of hepatic adenoma in this case; is that correct?
[5]A Yes.
[6]MR. HABERMAN: Objection.
[7]THE WITNESS: I mean, they're
[8]intermingled there. Obesity, OCPs, those are
[9]the main ones that she has.
[10]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[11]Q And you recognize that there is
[12]literature that suggests she had additional
[13]incident risk factors, NASH; correct?
[14]A I haven't found that as a big link in the
[15]development of hepatic adenoma. She could be a
[16]potential case report, but the literature that I
[17]presented doesn't show a big link, and the
[18]articles specifically talk about the lack of
[19]direct evidence that that pathway leads to
[20]adenomas.
[21]Q Okay. I appreciate your answer, but I
[22]think you answered a slightly different question
[23]than the one I asked. My question was just: Do
[24]you agree that there's literature that suggests
[25]NASH could be another --
  Page 154
[1]A There's two or three case reports,
[2]Mr. Suffern.
[3]Q And to you that doesn't rise to the level
[4]of putting that into the list of things that may
[5]have contributed in this case; correct?
[6]A Correct.
[7]Q Okay.
[8]A Some of the other series that had more
[9]patients with NASH had oral contraceptive use
[10]also.
[11]MR. SUFFERN: I think, subject to any
[12]follow-up that I may have if Mr. Haberman's
[13]going to ask you some questions, that's all I
[14]have for you, Dr. Alsina. It's nice to see you
[15]again, sir, I appreciate you answering my
[16]questions today.
[17]THE WITNESS: You're welcome.
[18]CROSS-EXAMINATION
[19]BY MR. HABERMAN:
[20]Q Hey, Doctor, how are you?
[21]A I'm fine.
[22]Q Just some follow-up questions.
[23]Can you tell us generally what you did to
[24]come up with the opinions that you've rendered in
[25]this case?
  Page 155
[1]A Which of the opinions?
[2]Q Well, let's talk about your causation
[3]opinion. First, do you believe more likely than
[4]not that Ms. Smith's use of oral contraceptives
[5]caused or contributed substantially to cause her
[6]hepatic adenomas?
[7]MR. SUFFERN: Object to the form.
[8]THE WITNESS: Yes, that is my position
[9]based on longstanding use and the preponderance
[10]of the evidence.
[11]BY MR. HABERMAN:
[12]Q And so let's just talk about your
[13]methodology that you employed to reach that
[14]conclusion. What kind of materials did you review
[15]to reach that conclusion?
[16]A I read all the literature pertaining to
[17]the historic cases of a series of formation of
[18]adenomas in different populations.
[19]Q And did you also consider Ms. Smith's
[20]medical records?
[21]A Yes. Medical records, her medical
[22]history, correct.
[23]Q And that medical record review and
[24]medical history review was not just limited to the
[25]time that you cared for her, but you were provided
  Page 156
[1]with other medical records as well; right?
[2]A Yes, sir.
[3]Q Now, you talked a lot about with
[4]Mr. Suffern other risk factors or the risk factors
[5]that are linked to hepatic adenomas. Do you
[6]recall those types of questions and the answers
[7]that you gave?
[8]A Yes.
[9]Q Can you explain why, more likely than
[10]not, you feel that Ms. Smith's hepatic adenomas
[11]were caused by or were caused substantially in
[12]part by her use of hepatic adenomas?
[13]MR. SUFFERN: Object to form.
[14]THE WITNESS: Because she has risk
[15]factors, she has longstanding use, and she
[16]doesn't have any other strange extraneous risk
[17]factors such as vascular diseases, you know,
[18]the other rare ones that we -- that have been
[19]mentioned. So it's based on the longstanding
[20]duration, based on her obesity, and fatty
[21]liver.
[22]BY MR. HABERMAN:
[23]Q Do you know whether or not obesity played
[24]a contributing role in this case to Ms. Smith's
[25]development of hepatic adenomas?
  Page 157
[1]A Hard to know, Mr. Haberman. That
[2]condition is highly prevalent in patients with
[3]adenomas, so it's prevalent there by association,
[4]but it's hard to know what causes it, but most
[5]patients that are obese and use oral
[6]contraceptives are the ones that are at risk for
[7]adenoma formation.
[8]Q So even if Ms. Smith had obesity, is it
[9]still your opinion that her use of hepatic
[10]adenomas was a substantial contributing factor to
[11]her development of hepatic -- let me back that up.
[12]Even considering her obesity, is it still
[13]your opinion that her use of oral contraceptives
[14]was a substantial contributing factor to causing
[15]her hepatic adenomas?
[16]MR. SUFFERN: Object to the form.
[17]THE WITNESS: Yes, I think it is, based
[18]on what we reviewed, all the bulk of the
[19]evidence that I have.
[20]BY MR. HABERMAN:
[21]Q Okay. I want to move on to the opinion
[22]that you have with regards to the adequacy or
[23]inadequacy of the warning on the risk of hepatic
[24]adenomas, Doctor.
[25]A Yes, sir.
  Page 158
[1]Q Okay. Why is it your opinion, your
[2]medical opinion, that Teva did not adequately warn
[3]of the risk of hepatic adenomas?
[4]MR. SUFFERN: Object to the form.
[5]THE WITNESS: Okay. The risks are not
[6]really magnified in terms of how much the risk
[7]is over nonusers, and there's a significant
[8]100-fold increase, several hundred fold
[9]increase in patients that take OCPs for a long
[10]time.
[11]BY MR. HABERMAN:
[12]Q And you believe that that information
[13]should have been communicated to prescribing
[14]physicians; right?
[15]MR. SUFFERN: Object to form.
[16]THE WITNESS: Well, in some way. I don't
[17]think there was any communication afterwards,
[18]after the drug was marketed either, that had
[19]ever been done.
[20]MR. HABERMAN: That's all I have. Thank
[21]you, Doctor.
[22]THE WITNESS: You're welcome.
[23]MR. SUFFERN: Just a little bit of
[24]follow-up.
[25]
  Page 159
[1]REDIRECT EXAMINATION
[2]BY MR. SUFFERN:
[3]Q You believe that the label was inadequate
[4]because it didn't specifically mention what Rooks
[5]reported as a 500-fold increase for people who had
[6]been using it for more than 85 months; is that
[7]right?
[8]A That's part of it; that's part of it.
[9]Nor the 30-fold increase was mentioned either.
[10]Q And that was for people who were using
[11]it, according to the Rooks paper, for a somewhat
[12]less period; correct?
[13]A It doesn't specify the increase over
[14]nonusers.
[15]Q And is it the data from Rooks that talks
[16]about those increases that you think should have
[17]been more clearly described in the labeling?
[18]A Yes, sir.
[19]MR. SUFFERN: That's all I have.
[20]COURT REPORTER: Read or waive?
[21]MR. HABERMAN: I'm finished.
[22]MR. SUFFERN: Read and sign?
[23]MR. HABERMAN: Doctor, you have the
[24]option to read and sign your transcript or you
[25]can waive that. I think last time you read it,
  Page 160
[1]so whatever you want to do again.
[2]THE WITNESS: Last time I read it before
[3]it was official?
[4]MR. HABERMAN: I'm going by memory. It's
[5]your option if you want to read the transcript
[6]over to check for the accuracy of the court
[7]reporter's transcription, you can do that; if
[8]not, we can waive it.
